Peter Bjorn and John,Breakin’ Point,Rock,5.7,June 9 2016,Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,"An indie band’s commercial breakthrough, when and if it comes, is a tricky landmark to pass unscathed. If the follow-up doesn’t catch, the band tends to go one of three ways: They can call it quits, accepting their commercial decrepitude; wind things down over a couple of albums, continuing to tour the hits as a glorified karaoke act; or, as a last resort, enlist some decorated pop producers who will, in theory, affix makeshift wings and propel them into the stratosphere. So it is with Peter Bjorn and John, a Swedish trio inseparably wed to a pretty whistling melody from 2006, whose songwriting smarts always promised an elusive second wind. Breakin’ Point, their sixth album and first in five years, attempts to reclaim unpaid dues: written as the trio studied ABBA’s greatest hits, recorded in that band’s old studio, and completed with Paul Epworth, Greg Kurstin, Emile Haynie, and other major producers with considerable résumés. (The band's Björn Yttling, a notable producer in his own right, worked alongside Kurstin on Lykke Li's recent albums.) They return a new band: edges planed, eccentricities jettisoned, with a strict emphasis on the effortless hooks that made Writer's Block click. Song to song, they apply the formula with some success. But three albums on from that breakout LP, Breakin’ Point seems an optimistic title—in 2016, the record arrives almost a decade too late. That’d be by-the-by if the songs served a purpose beyond mainstream expansion, which they sometimes do. Highlight “Hard Sleep” is convincingly euphoric, full of jubilant falsetto and carnival bombast. Its winning formula—lyrics of waning romance, choruses determined to bounce and soar regardless—is capably reproduced throughout the record. But the song stands out as a rare home-run on an album too blandly ambitious to stick in the memory. Interestingly, PB&J have history folding their musical ennui into the songs themselves: Gimme Some’s “Second Chance” scans as a commentary on the struggle to replicate “Young Folks”’ success, while “It Don’t Move Me,” from Living Thing, juxtaposes post-relationship blues with self-referential allusions to a creative impasse. Into that lineage step the title track, with its throwback whistling melody, and “Pretty Dumb Pretty Lame,” a cautionary tale of ballooning egos and one-night-stands—“getting hooked on all the strangers barking your name.” It’s hard to tell whether the latter is a reprimand to industry prima donnas or a jab at the band itself. “If you enjoy what you do, don’t let it ruin you,” is the lyrical conclusion, before an ambiguously apathetic chorus: “Hey, don’t let it get to your head/Hey, others could do it instead.” Along with the decorated producers, the abandoned sonic trademarks, it makes you wonder if Breakin’ Point isn’t a vague experiment in which PB&J try, with maximum self-awareness, to “sell out.” If that is the case—and fair play to them if so, they just haven’t quite pulled it off—you might’ve expected a finer focus on why great pop resonates. The songs are skilful constructions: dynamic, propellant, with jingly verses and big, punctual choruses. But PB&J are prone to fluffing the details—take “Dominos”’ unconscionably irritating chorus, or “Nostalgic Intellect”’s make-you-think lyrics: “What’s the point with a phone that smart/If you don’t have a flexible heart?” Clunky words aside, the songs, while uncluttered, suffer a particular kind of too-muchness. “We treated the album like 12 singles, rather than an album,” Peter Morén said recently, “which of course makes a very good album.” While there’s nothing wrong with that notion, the problem is that when a song’s drama simply exists—when every line throbs with urgency, yet the characters feel less like conflicted people than vessels for indie-pop intensity—the stakes feel low, the conflict superficial. For all its rousing clap-alongs, Breakin’ Point sounds like the lonely work of a band who’ve forgotten how to love their own music.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21961-breakin-point/,Ingrid,2016.0,"Hey there music lovers, today I want to talk about Peter Bjorn and John's album ""Breakin' Point."" If you're into rock, then this album is worth a listen.

To give you a little background on the band, they formed in Sweden in 1999 and have been producing indie rock music ever since. You may recognize their hit song ""Young Folks"" which was released in 2006 and earned them international success.

Now, let's get into ""Breakin' Point."" The album was created after the band experienced a period of writer's block and decided to collaborate with other musicians and producers. The outcome is an eclectic mix of rock songs that feature electronic elements and catchy choruses.

Personally, I found the album to have a few standout tracks like ""Dominos"" and ""Hard Sleep."" ""Dominos"" has a driving beat and lyrics that speak to the feeling of being stuck in a rut and needing to break free. ""Hard Sleep"" is a dreamy ballad that showcases Peter's smooth vocals and the band's ability to create an atmospheric sound.

However, there were also a few tracks that didn't quite hit the mark for me. ""Breakin' Point"" and ""Nostalgic Intellect"" felt a bit repetitive and didn't offer anything new or exciting.

Overall, I'd rate ""Breakin' Point"" a solid 6 out of 10. It's not the band's strongest album, but it still has some great moments and showcases their ability to experiment with different styles while still sticking to their rock roots.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of Peter Bjorn and John or just enjoy indie rock with electronic elements, then ""Breakin' Point"" is definitely worth a listen.","1. Review A contains more complex sentence structures and vocabulary, while Review B is more conversational and straightforward.

"Avey Tare, Kría Brekkan",Pullhair Rubeye,"Experimental,Electronic",1.0,April 26 2007,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"It's possible to listen to and discuss this album by married couple Avey Tare (real name: David Portner; main gig: Animal Collective) and Kria Brekkan (aka Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir, formerly of Múm, lots of guest appearances since) on a conceptual plane. As has been widely disseminated in the online community, Pullhair Rubeye was essentially complete last December when, prompted in part by a viewing of director David Lynch's Inland Empire, Portner and Valtýsdóttir decided to reverse the tapes and release the album with all the songs running backward. There's plenty of experimental music out there-- long drones, say-- where such a move might have gone unnoticed; this isn't one of them. The original tapes consisted of earthy, folky songs of simple construction consisting of mostly acoustic guitar, piano, and voice. Some potentially interesting questions crop up. Portner and Valtýsdóttir knew lots of people would re-reverse the record to hear its source; indeed, plenty of computer-savvy fans have already ""fixed"" Pullhair Rubeye, and-- what do you know-- in its original form, it's a damn nice album. Though Portner and Valtýsdóttir's main projects have little in common, here they are aesthetically simpatico. Relative to the dark material Portner released on his half of a 2003 split EP, these tracks show him with an interest in singsong melody and childlike simplicity as pronounced as that of his partner-in-crime Panda Bear. And while I am no fan of Valtýsdóttir's infantilized coo of a voice, I like it in this context better than anywhere outside the first Múm record. So I highly recommend that Animal Collective fans seek out the re-reversed copies of Pullhair Rubeye. They are enjoyable. And the computer-savvy downloaders helped make them. Another point of interest: there is something compelling about how ""acoustic"" music can become ""electronic"" merely by running the tape backward. In their original form, these are ""songs;"" reversed, if they are going to be appreciated at all, these ""songs"" are heard as ""ambient pieces."" So yeah, conceptually, Pullhair Rubeye might have something on the ball, and I'm always a fan of playful gestures. But then there's, you know, the thing that sits on store shelves and costs money. And that version of Pullhair Rubeye is remarkably dull. For me personally, the irony is that I've long considered myself the biggest sucker ever born for the simple backward effect. In reviews I've praised passages for their ""disorientation"" and ""peculiar sense of longing"" that were no more than a couple of notes tapped out on a piano and flipped over in Pro Tools. I admit it; it's easy to pull off, but backward instruments can still get to me. Probably all that time as a kid spent listening for Satanic back-masking when I should have been outside playing kick the can (or maybe it was those Beatles records). A whole album of this one effect, however, the reverse piano and reverse guitar and reverse voices going from decay to attack over and over and over again for 31 minutes... man, it's not just boring, it actually becomes depressing. It all kind of bleeds together into one bland and undifferentiated sonic blob that I never need to hear again. That's one nice thing about living when we do, though: Unlike Lou Reed fans with Metal Machine Music or Flaming Lips fans with Zaireeka, no one is going to pick this up on a whim without knowing what they're getting into. The information is out there. Everyone who knows and cares about the Animal Collective, everyone who follows the doings of Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir, all these folks also spend time online and so know Pullhair Rubeye's story. So it's not a rip-off, at least, we have to give them that. It's also no fun whatsoever to listen to.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10153-pullhair-rubeye/,Paw Tracks,2007.0,"Welcome to the sonic world of Avey Tare and Kría Brekkan's 'Pullhair Rubeye' - a controversial album that's widely regarded as an experimental masterpiece. If you're looking for a run-of-the-mill electronic album, then this is probably not the album for you. But if you're willing to take a dive into the deep end of experimental music, then you're absolutely in for a treat.

For those who are unaware, Avey Tare (David Portner) and Kría Brekkan (Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir) are two members of the beloved band Animal Collective. 'Pullhair Rubeye' was born out of a unique and intriguing creative process - the entire album was recorded in one take, then reversed and put through other various editing processes.

When the album was first released, it was received with mixed reactions. Many critics and fans alike found it difficult to digest the unconventional structure and unconventional sounds. The music felt bizarre, almost alien in its form, which made it incredibly difficult to compare it to any other album that came before it. However, the album has since gained a cult following - a small but dedicated group of listeners who appreciate the album's adventurous spirit and its refusal to conform to any established sound.

There's definitely a sense of confusion for those who first listen to 'Pullhair Rubeye'. The entire structure of the music feels expansive yet claustrophobic, with layered sounds stacked on top of each other, becoming almost suffocating at times. It's chaotic at times, but the listener will immediately recognize that this is an album that was carefully crafted with every sound and harmony thoughtfully considered.

What the album may lack in traditional musicality is made up in the emotional impact it has on the listener. Once you allow yourself to be engulfed in the music, there are moments where this album can cause a visceral reaction in you. It's jarring, challenging, and ambiguous - but the ambiguity is part of the process of interpreting what Avey Tare and Kría Brekkan want to convey through their music.

Despite its confusing nature, there's something still essentially human about 'Pullhair Rubeye'. It's hard not to appreciate the raw, animalistic sound of the music that connects with the primal parts of our human nature.

All in all, 'Pullhair Rubeye' isn't an album that's going to be for everybody, but for those who are willing to appreciate something unconventional, then it's definitely worth experiencing. It demands your full attention, your patience, and your willingness to explore something different.","1. Review A includes personal opinions and anecdotes, while Review B is more objective.

Spring Heel Jack,Masses,Jazz,8.6,June 5 2001,Christopher Dare,,"Spring Heel Jack entered the electronica scene in the mid-90's, clearly on the living-room listening side of the drum-n-bass spectrum. The beats on 1996's 68 Million Shades came complex, but despite their rapid pace the overall sonic texture was subdued, making for a smooth, pedestrian vibe. The following album, Busy Curious Thirsty, locked into the harder dance groove that was developing at the time, though a closer listen showed that the real intent was the creation of a roughened, more diverse sound. The new direction lost a lot of their audience, though, and the ambient pieces were numbingly repetitious. In a typical major label move, Island dropped the duo from its roster. Since then, John Coxon and Ashley Wales have been working hard, and each of their recent endeavors have been more successful-- from the driving, eerie Treader to the slightly softer, more cinematic Disappeared and the noisy ambient experiments collected on Oddities. They've also taken a cue from Fila Brazillia, who produced the strangely pristine luster on Greg Dulli's Twilight Singers project. Coxon & Wales collaborated with Low in 2000 on the Bombscare EP, in which all junglist tendencies vanished, subsumed into Low's stark minimalism; likewise, Alan Sparhawk & Co. found their fragile song frames reinforced by a mesh of synthetic subtlety and carefully controlled drones. The union got called ""experimental"" mostly due to the uncomfortable tension the album evoked. Masses invigorates the Thirsty Ear label's fusion project, ""The Blue Series Continuum."" Spring Heel Jack have toyed with jazz since their early days-- sampling a brassy trumpet trill here, employing a live percussion sample from Tortoise there-- but as time progressed, they showed interest in jazz as a structural template rather than cut-and-paste decoration. For Masses, they recorded a number of ambient soundscapes composed of crackling feedback and found sound (once again absent of breakbeats), and gathered choice labelmates to improvise over the recordings. Some of the most influential names in the new breed of free jazz participated, from the dynamic duo of pianist Matthew Shipp and double bassist William Parker to mercurial saxophonist Evan Parker. The result is the most intense, fascinating album of Spring Heel Jack's career. ""Chorale"" opens in static pulses. Shipp hesitantly takes lead with four- and five-note piano clusters, while William Parker's bass explores the space between the rumbling drones. One aspect of the prerecorded soundtracks is that the musicians can slow down and test intimate, abstract harmonies usually only available to duos and trios. Evan Parker's lone soprano sax line repeats after long intervals, intriguingly programmatic considering his usual repertoire. This melancholy motif is the only semblance of melody in the entire song, and the noir ambience would fit perfectly in Blade Runner when Deckard sips his drink alone in the dim living room. ""Chiaroscuro"" defines an opposite approach-- an amplified two-note bassline followed by a handclap serves as the rhythmic anchor for the entire track. Hardly boring, this relentless, aggressive reverb is the current through which Daniel Carter runs his saxophone, at first a playful expedition that becomes increasingly strained and frenetic. Guillermo Brown busts three minutes afterwards with overlapping bass-drum rolls and snares, adding to the uneasiness. Trying to isolate the organic from the preprocessed is difficult; at times, the streaks of Ed Coxon's violin blend seamlessly with the humming bed of distortion. The title track, on which all players are involved, is by far the standout. Brown plays schizophrenically liberated percussion, abusing cowbells and the drumstand itself as pianist Shipp jabs at the low register ivory keys. A sudden crescendo: seconds too late, you realize these were pebbles before the rockslide. The onslaught erupts, burying the listener in a lung-collapsing surge of saxophone wails, trumpet squeals and double-bass throttling. The moment ends as soon as it began, dispersing into Brown's maniacally inspired building-block clatter. If the ascendant free jazz of the 1960's came to be known as ""Fire Music,"" the elemental force here takes place somewhere between metamorphic earth and storm-strewn air, though the electrical fury can hardly be traced back along its silicate tangents to any original resting place. But don't assume that the entire album is impenetrable noise. A few short interludes separate the longer works, giving single musicians the chance to test their mettle against the compositions. On ""Cross,"" I felt transported to a swirling fantasia, sure that the background was tampering with Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" until I realized that this was just Mat Maneri in the foreground on acoustic and electric viola. ""Salt"" is a comparatively straightforward number, launched by Brown and William Parker's hard-bop rhythm and spiced by Shipp's Monk-like vamping. But the final track, ""Coda,"" returns to the spatial acoustics of the first. Coxon and Wales pull the buzzing chimes of their earliest work off the lathe, causing the trumpet-like microtonality of Maneri's viola to recede into the background. Masses compresses so many components: improv artists from New York jam with Londoners and other Europeans, organic instruments collide with digital spree, free jazz is tempered by prerecorded loops. Curated by Matthew Shipp and sequenced by the Spring Heel boys, this is steaming hot fusion, a record whose density and emotional nuance requires repeated listening to decipher. Many questions are raised, but the one that tugs most anxiously in my mind is whether Coxon and Wales will attempt improvisational electronics themselves on future projects.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7438-masses/,Thirsty Ear,2001.0,"Spring Heel Jack's 'Masses' is a jazz masterpiece that will have you moving and grooving as soon as the first note hits your ears. This album showcases the incredible chemistry between members Ashley Wales and John Coxon, both accomplished musicians in their own right, who have been making music together for over a decade.

The story of 'Masses' goes back to their previous album 'Amassed', which was an experimental foray into the world of electronic music. While many fans were thrilled with the album, others felt that the duo had moved too far from their jazz roots. Taking this feedback to heart, Wales and Coxon set out to make an album that would blend the electronic experimentation of 'Amassed' with their jazz heritage. And they absolutely nailed it!

From the opening track 'Litmus', it's clear that this album is a departure from their previous work. You can hear a strong nod to Miles Davis in the use of electronic instruments and experimental sounds, but the combination with traditional jazz creates something truly unique. The standout track is 'Bane', which starts with a slow and haunting melody before building to an explosive climax. It's a track that showcases the duo's ability to create a sonic landscape that is both captivating and challenging.

But it's not just the technical prowess of the musicians that makes this album so great. There's a raw emotional honesty to the music that will make you feel like you're experiencing something truly special. As a listener, you can feel the connection between the musicians and their instruments - an intangible quality that sets this jazz album apart from others.

As a long-time fan of Spring Heel Jack, I was blown away by 'Masses'. This album is a testament to their growth as artists and their dedication to creating bold and innovative music. It's the kind of album that you'll want to listen to from start to finish in one sitting, because each track blends seamlessly into the next. If you're a fan of jazz, this album is a must-listen - and even if you're not, you might just find yourself converted after hearing the sheer brilliance of 'Masses'. 

Overall, I'd give this album an 8.6 out of 10.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed.

Tyga,Kyoto,Rap,3.3,February 23 2018,Torii MacAdams,,"Tyga is preposterous. He’s a platonic doofus, a happy-go-lucky heel, and a distillation of Los Angeles’ most garish impulses. The canary-yellow Lamborghini shrieking through red lights on Sunset Boulevard? That’s Tyga. A pseudo-pensive pose on the glass-ringed balcony of a rented Hollywood Hills mansion, Instagram captioned: “it took alot of grindin to get here”? That’s Tyga. The guy in a gold backwards cap getting served legal papers at an L.A. Gear event? That, quite literally, is Tyga. It’s appropriate, then, that his latest career move is a preposterous one. Kyoto is a pleading, quasi-introspective R&B album by a rapper previously best known for unsubtle lyrics about his unyielding acquisitiveness—he gets laid, gets money, and gets high. Why the sudden change in tack? “The last five years of my life has been a lot of me in the media because of my relationships,” he recently told Billboard, presumably referring to his time with Blac Chyna and a youthful Kylie Jenner. “I can’t even go to the movies with a girl anymore. It’s a gift and a curse. I really wanted to step in front of the narrative and create my own story.” After 52 minutes of Kyoto, it remains unclear what that story is. Instead of addressing the alienating nature of celebrity, or the motivations for his romantic choices, or the past (and maybe necessary) falsity of his public persona, Tyga mostly opts for bad puns and shallow platitudes. On “Temperature,” a dancehall-style dud that recalls “1 of 1” from—sigh, deep breath—Bitch I’m The Shit 2, he intones in a half-assed patois, “I lost my watch and I still found time.” Or, on “Hard2Look” (more like “Hard2ListenTo,” amiright?), he sings, “I know this bustdown Patek won’t switch sides/I know this Lambo won’t switch sides/I know my true fans won’t switch sides.” Or, worse, on the hazy “King of the Jungle,” he admits, “I’ve been unfaithful/I’ve been lyin’ like the king of the jungle.” More obvious than its spiritual emptiness is the album’s somnambulance. As is de rigueur in contemporary R&B, Kyoto tries to pass off silken textures and washed-out vocal samples as sensual and vulnerable. But those sensual, vulnerable tones should, ideally, boil at some point into something with a burning immediacy. These songs don’t, and much of the album just sounds exhausted. These inert instrumentals don’t do Tyga any favors: He’s more of a melodic, vibing vocalist than an outright singer, and the sparseness only serves to highlight his limited range. Eventually, the yawning void of imagination at the center of Kyoto becomes downright oppressive. The album is nearly an hour of rote box-checking: two dancehall songs—check (“Temperature” and “Holdin On”); an EDM-inspired club track—check (“Leather in The Rain”); near-scandalous revelations about another celebrity, in this case Kylie Jenner—check (“King of the Jungle”); an A-list guest verse—check (Gucci Mane mails it in on “Sip A Lil”). I’ve seen more daring artistic flourishes on the walls of gas station bathrooms. Sadly, this album seems likely to generate a crossover hit or two. My predictions: “Temperature” is going to score the transfer of a communicable disease at a Las Vegas pool, and “Leather in the Rain” will ooze from tinny fitting-room speakers at fast fashion stores across the country. For a project with a sexualized cartoon cat-woman on the cover, recorded by an artist known for his horniness, the whole of Kyoto is, well, flaccid.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tyga-kyoto/,"Last Kings,EMPIRE",2018.0,"Greetings fellow music lovers! Today I've got a review on Tyga's latest album ""Kyoto"". First let me just break down the history of the artist, as knowing the backstory can often provide insight into the album. Tyga, also known as Michael Ray Stevenson, is a rapper from California who gained popularity in the late 2000s for his mixtapes and collaborations with Lil Wayne. Tyga's music has often been described as party rap with a lot of electronic and pop influences. However, ""Kyoto"" feels different from the usual Tyga we're all used to.

The creation of this album was anything but normal. Tyga took himself all the way to Kyoto, Japan to create. He was in search of inspiration and a new perspective. The recording process was said to be therapeutic and the music was made to express the pain and struggle Tyga had recently gone through. He stated in an interview, ""The album is me opening up and expressing myself through my music, and I wanted to clear my mind and start fresh.""

So, my personal experience of listening to ""Kyoto"" was a mix of emotions. I'll be honest, I'm not the biggest Tyga fan, but I do appreciate his past work. Nonetheless, I went into the album with an open mind. The first thing that hit me was the album's production. The beats were well made and clearly, some thought went into the instrumentals. There is a lot of use of piano throughout the album, which gives it an organic feel.

However, as a rap album, the actual rap verses did leave me wanting more. Lyrically, the album wasn't very strong. Tyga's raps on this album aren't very inspired, with many of the bars being forgettable. A strong aspect of the album, however, is the features. We have artists like Gucci Mane and Tory Lanez delivering standout verses. This helps add variety to what would otherwise be a boring listen.

Overall I would give ""Kyoto"" a rating of 3.3 out of 10. Don't get me wrong, the album is not terrible. It's actually a refreshing change of pace for Tyga. However, the actual rapping leaves a lot to be desired. It's certainly not the best album of 2018 in this music genre, but it's worth a listen if you're looking for something different.","1.

Various Artists,Rush Hour Presents Amsterdam All Stars,,6.4,January 12 2012,Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,"It says something about the state of electronic dance music that my favorite aspect of Rush Hour Presents Amsterdam All Stars is the fact that ""Vol. 1"" doesn't follow its title. Not that a second volume would be unwelcome; it's that we're in the midst of a run in which most compilations (from the big houses, at least) are weighty, extra-long attempts to define a genre, rep a label, or map a career. They are, in other words, short historical arcs offered by a scene that is still learning how to manage its past. In this context, All Stars is a breath of fresh air, purporting to offer nothing more than a glimpse of the current house music talent operating in or originating from Amsterdam, Rush Hour's home base since 1997. The 12 exclusive tracks offered here are, as advertised, a set of raucous, 4/4 shakers born in the 1980s in Chicago but possessing updated wardrobes. Given the label it's hardly a surprise, but it bears mentioning that All Stars has absolutely nothing to do with the squeaky arena-fodder known as ""Dirty Dutch"" or Dutch House. All Stars might plausibly be presented as an alternative were it not for the fact that the very existence of labels like Rush Hour and their fanbases are testaments to the desire for substitutes. (If a massive Afrojack fan hears this comp and has her eureka moment, I'll swear off colored vinyl for a year.) On the whole All Stars is dense and bold, casting off any minimalist impulses in favor of buzzy machinations that rely on manicured loops in lieu of samples. I hesitate to describe this as an ""Amsterdam sound,"" as it's more likely the result of a youth-oriented lineup. Dexter, Melon, and Newworldaquarium constitute the old guard here, the latter's ""Liberty Hot"" being the comp's most sexual and incisive rhythm. But really the show is in the hands of contemporaries like Tom Trago, whose foggy, see-sawing ""Once Upon a Time in Amsterdam"" stirs my urban Euro fetishism, and the perpetually on-the-verge Juju & Jordash, whose brushed-steel drum programming is refreshingly aggressive. The standout newcomer is Maxi Mill, a producer confident enough to stop momentum mid-track to make way for a burr-laden bassline. There are too many rote sawing strings and punchy synth pads, but Rush Hour proves that Amsterdam is big enough to supply the talent and small enough to prevent All Stars from seeming unwieldy or obvious. If there's an overarching goal here it appears to be to convince you that you could have a good time at an Amsterdam club on a Thursday without a touring DJ in town. Used-CD bins are stuffed with obscure and ultra-specific house compilations from the early 90s. All Stars' small-ball focus is a throwback in this way; five years from now it will likely offer little utility, though I wouldn't make the same bet about the artists contained herein.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16169-rush-hour-presents-amsterdam-all-stars/,Rush Hour,2011.0,"Every now and then, a music album comes along that not only rocks your world but also stays true to its roots. Rush Hour Presents Amsterdam All Stars by Various Artists is one such album, showcasing the best of the electronic dance music scene. This album comes with an impressive rating of 6.4 out of 10, and as someone who has been listening to music for a while, I can tell you that this is an impressive feat.

The album is a fusion of different styles within nan, from bass-heavy techno to dreamy soundscapes. The characteristic of this album is that it sounds like a collective effort, featuring artists who have made their mark on the scene while still developing their craft. The featured artists include Mor Elian, VC-118A, Upsammy, and Maayan Nidam, who have all individually carved out niches for themselves.

There's something special about this album that keeps me coming back for more. Perhaps it's the fact that Amsterdam is known for its music scene, and this album is like a tribute to the city that inspired it. The album feels like a sonic journey, taking listeners from one stunning soundscape to another. The production quality is top-notch, with a fine balance between melody and rhythm.

What sets Rush Hour Presents Amsterdam All Stars apart from other albums in the nan genre is that it never gets boring. It's a refreshing departure from the formulaic dance music typically found on the charts. Its ability to capture a moment in time and create a cohesive album is commendable.

In conclusion, if you're looking for an electronic music album that is more than just a few dance tracks thrown together, Rush Hour Presents Amsterdam All Stars is worth a listen. It's an impressive feat that manages to marry innovative sounds with a deep respect for the genre's history. As someone who enjoys the occasional dance music track, this album is a standout.","1.

In the past 15 years, the Japanese trio has released more than 20 albums of heavy eclecticism-- stoner bludgeons and thrash blasts, dense drones and noise screes. They're the band with Atsuo-- the screaming, gong-banging drummer with one of those arena-rock, hands-off microphones-- and Takeshi, a multi-instrumentalist who plays a double-necked guitar so often and well that it doesn't seem like an affectation. Michio Kurihara, one of the world's best psychedelic guitarists, works as Boris' touring sideman. From former labelmates Sunn O))) to fellow Japanese sonic explorers Merzbow and Keiji Haino, they've also collaborated with a long list of experimental luminaries. All of this seems to be part and parcel to Boris' methodical quest to build a legacy of expansive, new heavy music, where no form is too sacred to break, no idea too mainstream to incorporate. If that's their plan, it's largely worked. Accordingly, there are few release-day gestures more rock star than issuing two albums at the same time, as Boris will do with the slight electropop-and-shoegaze departure Attention Please and the requisite metal grab bag Heavy Rocks. What's more, this is the second Boris LP to sport the title Heavy Rocks; the first was released in 2002, and nearly a decade later, it still stands as one of Boris' best efforts, a landmark distillation of stoner metal and noise rock built with enviable precision and aggression. This moment, then, is not only Boris' look-how-popular-we-are exclamation but also their look-how-much-we've-grown assertion; essentially, Attention Please and Heavy (Heavier?) Rocks are logical next steps for the Boris legacy. But riddled as this pair of albums is with confounding musical indecision and listless stylistic repetition, they mostly serve as reminders of how remarkable and inventive Boris have been and often threaten to be. Heavy Rocks was sturdier back in 2002, while the appropriately titled Attention Please-- even if the more interesting of these two discs-- is a flimsy showcase for Boris guitarist Wata as a would-be college-rock frontwoman. Heavy Rocks does the things you expect a Boris album to do: It explodes open with ""Riot Sugar"", a brutal blues-metal march with a rote, ragged riff and background grunts from the Cult's Ian Astbury. ""Missing Pieces"" alternates between spare guitar drift, gnarls of noise, and an epically forlorn crescendo, while the other 12-minute-plus tune, ""Aileron"", growls and swells before drifting off into a piano-and-distortion haze. For fans of Boris, the material is a double-edged sword: It's the sort of motley metal that brought you to the fold one way or another, but that means you've already heard it-- all of it, from the massive soundscapes on Pink to the dynamic sizzle in Amplifier Worship-- several times before. Here, it's all offered like a mixtape, with no narrative arch or musical momentum. Attention Please at least offers something fresh for Boris. For the first time in the band's long run, Wata takes lead vocal. Her consistent presence offers an atmosphere of patience, plus a cohesiveness that Boris have long since foregone. Sure, she leads the band through several different looks, from the tense, pretty opening title track to the dance-metal anthem ""Party Boy"". During ""See You Next Week"", she drifts like a ghost between a world of broken drum machines and guitars meant more for texture than melody. There's a ruminative instrumental for acoustic guitar, and ""Spoon"", a blustery tumble that-- Wata's willowy vocals aside-- favorably suggests the sound of 1990s American modern rock radio. What's best, the trio doesn't give up on its heavy metal experience; though this album suggests a stylistic mix of new wave and Mazzy Star, Boris play with the rumble and roar of a loud rock band. The bass line during the chiming ""Tokyo Wonder Land"" is a menacing throb, the guitar solo an acid-damaged roar. ""Les Paul Custom '86"" emerges as a dance number through sheets of noise, anchored by a riff that would have fit Earth in 1993. Those tell-all touches and Wata's command suggest that this is the better, if unforeseen, avenue for Boris' future. Though not fully developed, this is a space where they might actually explore without the constraints of reputation and expectation. The heavy metal landscape of 2011 is tailor-made for (and, sort of, by) Boris. Sure, the black metal kids are busy retrenching against boundary breakers like Liturgy and Altar of Plagues, and a whole lot of older burly bros will tell you that stoner, thrash, and melodramatic metal were done better the first time. They're not necessarily wrong, but those sorts of attitudes provide a welcome contrast for the tone of inclusion and acceptance for ideas that permeates not only some of the moment's most exciting metal but also music at large. Whether it's the elegiac folk singer heading for stacks of finely orchestrated keyboards or the black metal band backing its melee with a pure and purposed disco-punk throb, a whole crop of young acts now seem open to the possibilities within their forms. Their audiences largely seem interested in tagging along, too. After all, we obtain and hear music in radically different ways and contexts now than in 1996, when Boris were making their recorded debut as a noisy sludge-metal band from Tokyo. Boris' post-modern eclecticism is, in theory, perfect for this moment. But pastiches and piss-takes-- by and large, the sort of material that's scattered between Attention Please and the second Heavy Rocks-- can only satisfy so much. Boris seem to be racing to stay current, to show that they can change as rapidly as these hyper-wired times. With each new addition to a catalog that's becoming more adulterated each year, we're learning that maybe they can't.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15460-attention-please-heavy-rocks/,"Sargent House,Sargent House",2011.0,"Get ready to turn up the volume because Boris's latest album ""Attention Please"" is a headbanging ride you won't want to miss. With a brilliant mix of metal and rock, the album sends waves of adrenaline through your body that makes it impossible to sit still. From the electrifying guitar riffs to the pounding drums, Boris has delivered a masterpiece with this album - earning a solid rating of 7.1 out of 10.

For those unfamiliar with the band, Boris is a Japanese trio founded in 1992. With a long history of making groundbreaking music, they have gained a significant following in the rock and metal community. Their music is dynamic and eclectic, blending elements of punk, ambient, and doom. The band is known for their experimental approach and unique sound, and ""Attention Please"" is no exception.

From the moment you hit play, ""Attention Please"" grabs your attention and never lets go. The album's creation story goes back to 2010, when Boris's guitarist Wata released her first solo album, ""Sweet Dreams"". This album marked a new direction for her, with a focus on melody and pop sensibility. This experience inspired the band to create ""Attention Please"" and explore the idea of mixing their signature sound with more accessible melodies.

The result is a collection of nine dynamic tracks that feature catchy hooks and soaring choruses. The opening track, ""Attention Please"", sets the tone of the album with its explosive guitar riffs and driving beats. The vocals on this track, provided by bassist Takeshi, are a particular standout, delivering a powerful performance that perfectly complements the instrumentation.

One of the highlights of the album is the track ""Hope"" which has a slightly slower tempo and a more introspective feel. The haunting melody and intricate guitar work on this track create an atmosphere that is both ethereal and emotional. The lyrics touch on themes of loss and regret and are sung with raw emotion.

The album culminates in the track ""Spoon"", which is a fitting finale to this epic musical journey. The track unfolds at a measured pace, building to a blistering crescendo that leaves you breathless. The instrumental section of the track is particularly captivating, showcasing the band's impressive musicianship and chemistry.

All in all, ""Attention Please"" is a remarkable album that shows Boris's range and versatility. It's clear that the band wanted to push their boundaries with this album, and they have delivered something truly special as a result. If you're a fan of rock or metal, or just appreciate great music, then this album is a must-listen.","Step 1: Review A is longer and more detailed, covering various aspects of the band Boris, including their history, collaborations, and musical approach.

Acrylics,Lives and Treasure,,6.9,January 26 2011,Brian Howe,Contributor,"Acrylics are a modern band from Brooklyn that often sound like an old band from Anytown, U.S.A. They basically play soft-rock-- not the stylish brand of Phoenix, the psychedelic kind of Gayngs, the hazy Washed Out type, or the sly and subtle version favored by Destroyer. No, this is the broad and eclectic sort of soft-rock that might fall under the tastefully patterned umbrella of ""adult-contemporary,"" a radio format mostly defined by what it isn't: punk, metal, hard rock, rap, and so on. It's played on rock-based instruments with a strong vocal presence, a keen ear for arrangement and texture, and a knack for homogenized exotica. Otherwise, it lacks defining characteristics, meaning an aura of rebellion or the dominant influence of any single subculture. Molly Shea and Jason Klauber are the duo at the heart of Acrylics, though they expand to a quintet live. Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor produced and released their 2009 EP, All of the Fire. They move to the Hot Sands label for debut LP Lives and Treasure, which showcases a sound malleable enough to assimilate new wave, country, lite-funk, art-pop, and more. ""Sparrow Song"" is an ingenuous ode to Kate Bush's spacey electronic pop. The chilly disco-rock of ""Nightwatch"" has a sultry, hooky vocal that recalls Suzanne Vega's ""Tom's Diner"". Shades of Sinead O'Connor, Fleetwood Mac, Natalie Merchant, and American Music Club loom large. But traces of modern big-tent indie can be found as well. ""The Window"", with its woolly vocals and webbed acoustic arpeggios, splits the difference between Bright Eyes and Elliot Smith, while ""Asian Pear"" develops from dreamy beginnings into a lean tremolo-guitar anthem with the barking grandeur of Wolf Parade. Acrylics avoid fashionable chaos. Their interest is in getting a guitar's delay interval or flanger profile just right; in dropping the fill in the perfect spot. There are only a few mild solos, and more often, the guitar lays back as a glinting under-texture for big synths and voices. Shea is the better singer, with ironclad pitch and an interesting tang in her voice. Klauber's singing is a homelier mumble, though it grows on you. When their voices come together, things really click. The lyrics tend toward extremes, either abstrusely mystical (hers) or blurry and out-of-the-way (his). Shea flirts with something satirically new-agey at times, and between her soaring over the ""planets and skies and fields of a future time"" and Klauber's earthier ruminations, the emotional and conceptual centers feel vague. The best songs-- ""Counting Sheep"", ""Molly's Vertigo"", and ""Asian Pear""-- feature strong structural definition and crisp, surprising dynamic shifts. A handful of genre-based set pieces fare less well, like the wordy, meandering folk of ""It's Cool Here"". Dylanesque isn't the right look for Acrylics, who are better at carefully pruned exteriors than core songs. But even here, there are striking details to admire: Eerily diminished chords and harmonies drift like alien breezes through the slow, sentimental tune. Lacking what we call ""edge"" or any hint of outsider pretension, Lives and Treasure is not, by and large, designed to stir great passions-- it's soothing, controlled, and slightly superficial. The exceptions-- ""Asian Pear"" is a song with something on the line-- reinforce the rule. While the taste level occasionally falters, this is a fine and detail-oriented album that should be taken with a grain of salt by fans for whom music must always, at some level, be a site of iconoclasm.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15008-lives-and-treasure/,"Friendly Fire,Hot Sand",2011.0,"Lives and Treasure - Acrylics

Acrylics has always been one of those bands that have never shied away from experimentation. From their humble beginnings in the Brooklyn music scene to their current celebrated status, they have always been at the forefront of the underground music scene.

With their latest album, Lives and Treasure, Acrylics have taken their sound in a whole new direction. Incorporating elements of nan and other genres, they have managed to create a sonic landscape that is both haunting and beautiful.

The album begins with ""Lost Control"", a track that sets the tone for what is to come. The haunting melodies and mesmerizing rhythms immediately grab your attention and refuse to let go. As the album progresses, you can't help but be drawn into the world that Acrylics has created.

One of the things that I love about this album is the way that it flows together. Each track seamlessly transitions into the next, creating a listening experience that is truly immersive. The use of different instruments and textures throughout the album only adds to this, making each note and sound feel intentional and thoughtfully placed.

As I listened to this album, I couldn't help but feel transported to another world. The unique combination of sounds and the way they were blended together made it easy to get lost in the music. There were times when I felt like I was floating on a cloud of sound, completely engulfed by the beauty of it all.

Overall, Lives and Treasure is an album that I highly recommend. If you're a fan of experimental music or just looking for something new to listen to, this is an album that should be on your radar. Acrylics has truly outdone themselves with this one, and I can't wait to see where their music takes them in the future.","1.

Q-Tip,Kamaal the Abstract,Rap,6.3,September 18 2009,David Drake,Contributor,"Kamaal the Abstract is not a great record by any means. But it is an interesting one, a unique effort by an artist struggling to mesh two disparate musical systems, gambling that inherent internal friction could spark some excitement. Unfortunately, the road to 6.3 is paved with experimental intentions. Kamaal the Abstract first leaked at the beginning of the decade, the follow-up to Tip's solo debut Amplified. While the status of the latter record has only grown in the ensuing years, thanks largely to Dilla's rise as a cult production hero, Kamaal's nature as an experimental cul-de-sac feels more cemented with time. But the ink never dries in the history books; if anything, the 2000s may have finally given Kamaal and Kamaal an opportunity for creative redemption. The collision of jazz and hip-hop, of course, isn't a new concept, especially for an artist who worked with Ron Carter on Tribe's second LP. But with Tribe, never mind Digable Planets, Guru, or US3, incorporating jazz often felt like more of a stylistic affect than concrete engagement, just a couple of looped bars and a brief instrumental solo from a big name on a track outro. Since bebop revolutionized jazz in the 1940s, attempts to integrate the genre with pop forms have been risky. Tip's pops used to say hip-hop reminded him of bebop for a reason; at their best, jazz and rap both feature interconnected conversations and content being generated over a short time in their parallel worlds. But rap music's complexity is tied up in language, the melodic and harmonic aspects stripped down so as to focus the listener on the verbal. Post-bebop jazz usually hinges on harmonic complexity. Kamaal the Abstract, to its great credit, is unafraid of (messily) combining these values. Tip seems to have focused primarily on jazz's harmonic intricacies, evident on opener ""Feelin'"" or ""A Million Times"", which are unafraid to eschew pop song structure to get at the meat of what makes post-swing jazz harmonically interesting. But sometimes this nuanced backdrop sounds an off-note for the subject matter; while a bunch of ideas were going on in any Tribe-era Q-Tip verse, Tip's redundant boilerplate womanizing over Steely Dan-style chord changes on ""Heels"" just doesn't fit. Even worse, Tip's singing throughout the record -- a shallow signifier for this more ""soulful"" approach, perhaps? -- feels unnecessarily cautious. Very Andre 3k. But jazz gets shortchanged, too. For the most part, the solos feel safe and not particularly notable. Guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel's presence followed the release of an exciting, adventurous solo LP The Next Step, so it's confusing to hear his cameo reduced to rhythm guitar on the extended, platitudinous jam ""Do You Dig U?"". Even the incredible Kenny Garrett, who does get an extended solo feature on the stop-start funk “Abstractionisms,” seems to be holding back. It feels like the soloists were so conscious of the album's pop music concessions, they felt they had to dumb it down, afraid to cut loose, as if they were recording for “The Late Show” or a random studio session. Despite Tip's willingness to combine the stylistic approaches of jazz and hip-hop, many songs feel imbalanced this way, with potentially exciting material undercut by underwhelming performances or half-finished ideas. It is worth recognizing that the Miles and Mizells of the world were extraordinarily rare. Few artists could perfectly balance of jazz's intricate complexity as a live performance with lightning-in-a-bottle pop perfection as a piece of recorded art. Which is why ""Even If It Is So"" is such an accomplishment. With a simple repeated piano vamp over acoustic guitar, the song features the rapper riffing compassionately about single motherhood alongside a memorable horn hook. The music perfectly reflects the song's theme of subdued respect, the incredible beauty of strength in the most harrowing situations. It also leaves you wanting more, the kind of song you'd love to hear extended and embellished, perhaps in a live setting. Which is the key to this record's possibility; each track is a loose framework of unfulfilled promise. There's been a lot of talk about the growing importance of the live show to artists in the RapidShare era. While Kamaal isn't the brave, experimental success it wants to be, it doesn't exactly feel like the cul-de-sac it once did. It suggests a promising future, where the world of live shows offers Q-Tip and these soloists a chance to stretch out, while recalling their roots in entertainment, which isn't so evident here.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13471-kamaal-the-abstract/,Jive,2009.0,"Let's start with a little background on Q-Tip. He's been in the game for decades, starting with A Tribe Called Quest, one of the most influential hip-hop groups of all time. Known for his laid-back flow, abstract lyricism, and innovative production, Q-Tip has left an indelible mark on the rap game. His solo work has been hit or miss, but with ""Kamaal the Abstract,"" he delivers a solid effort that's worth a listen.

The album itself has an interesting creation story. It was originally recorded in the early 2000s, but was shelved by the label for not being ""commercial"" enough. It was finally released in 2009, after Q-Tip had left the label and regained control of the masters. The album is a departure from Q-Tip's earlier work, both with Tribe and as a solo artist. It's more experimental and jazz-inflected, with fewer traditional rap beats and more abstract sonic textures.

So, what's the album like? Well, if you're expecting a traditional Q-Tip album, you might be a bit disappointed. There are no obvious hits here, no ""Vivrant Thing"" or ""Breathe and Stop."" Instead, the album is a more introspective, meditative affair. Q-Tip raps about love, spirituality, and the struggles of being an artist. The album feels like a sonic journey, with each track leading seamlessly into the next.

One standout track is ""Barely In Love,"" a melancholy rumination on falling out of love. Q-Tip's flow is nimble and emotive, and the beat has a hypnotic quality that draws you in. ""Do You Dig U?"" is another highlight, featuring a jazzy, finger-snapping groove that showcases Q-Tip's love for old-school soul. The album's title track, ""Kamaal the Abstract,"" is a sprawling epic that shows off Q-Tip's production chops, layering live instruments and samples into a tapestry of sound.

That being said, the album isn't perfect. Some tracks drag on a bit too long, and Q-Tip's abstract rapping style can be hard to follow at times. It's also not as accessible as some of his earlier work, so it might not grab the attention of a casual listener. But if you're looking for an album that rewards repeated listens and showcases Q-Tip's artistic vision, ""Kamaal the Abstract"" is definitely worth checking out.

In the end, I'd give the album a solid 6.3 out of 10. It's not a classic, but it's a worthwhile addition to Q-Tip's catalog, and a reminder that he's still one of the most innovative and forward-thinking artists in hip-hop.","Step 1: Both reviews provide background information about Q-Tip.

Kaiser Chiefs,Employment,"Electronic,Rock",6.7,March 15 2005,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"I've never understood why British bands obscure their accents when they sing, but they've been doing it for ages-- at least since ""She Loves You"". Recently, however, there seems to be a mini-wave of UK acts brandishing their accents with a frequency last heard in the early days of post-punk. To these American ears, those vocals are part of what makes the Futureheads and Bloc Party sound as good as they do. Kaiser Chiefs are another of these groups, although their first album, Employment, isn't in the same league as the debuts from either of their above-mentioned countrymen. One reason for this is that the band keeps the energy level constant over the course of the entire disc. There's plenty of variety in the material-- with different rhythmic feels and tempos-- but every song is approached with the same kind of in-your-face ebullience as the others, an approach that grows tiring. Still, it's deadly entertaining in bursts-- especially if you pick out the right bursts. There are a handful of potential singles that make Employment worth the trip. Chief among them is ""Na Na Na Na Naa"", a song that rockets along on Manfred Mann pianos, setting the workmanlike harmonies of the verses against the titular falsetto hook. Kaiser Chiefs seem most comfortable at a sort of medium boil with big, energetic harmonies, Moog squiggles, and mild guitar/keyboard interplay. They can unleash an anthem when they choose, like ""Modern Day""-- the only song on the LP that is truly dynamic. Its fluid verses are the most spacious, unforced passages on the record, and there's a palpable sense of build prior to the towering chorus. Admittedly, the song also makes me picture band members asking for more cowbell in the monitor during recording, but that's also part of its charm. Opener ""Every Day I Love You Less and Less"" sets the tone with its tale of a guy who's so over his ex-girlfriend that he feels obliged to tell her how great his life is without her (in other words, he's pining). The band's spirited attack sells the track hook, line, and sinker. It's a shame that enthusiasm becomes exhausting by the record's end.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4595-employment/,Interscope,2005.0,"If you're looking for an album that's going to get you up off your feet and onto the dance floor, Kaiser Chiefs' ""Employment"" is the one for you. This mix of electronic and rock is not necessarily groundbreaking, but delivers an energetic punch with each track. Overall, I'd rate it a 6.7 out of 10.

Kaiser Chiefs is a British band that formed in 2000. Their band name is a reference to the South African football club Kaizer Chiefs. Before releasing their debut album ""Employment"" in 2005, they had gained popularity through live shows and had already released an EP and a single. Their sound is often compared to that of British bands like Blur and The Kinks, as well as American bands like The Strokes.

""Employment"" was created with a clear focus on catchy hooks and sing-along lyrics. The opening track, ""Everyday I Love You Less and Less,"" is a perfect example of their upbeat, danceable style. The chorus is so infectious that it's hard not to join in singing along after just one listen.

Following that, ""I Predict a Riot"" is arguably their biggest hit and showcases the slightly punky influence in their music. This track is without doubt one of the standout singles on the album. It's full on and anthemic and sets the tone for the rest of the album. From there, ""Modern Way"" and ""Na Na Na Na Naa"" continue the trend with equally catchy hooks and memorable choruses.

Even the slower songs on the album maintain the same energy level by incorporating electronic beats and memorable guitar riffs that keep the listener engaged. ""Caroline, Yes"" and ""You Can Have It All"" are two tracks that stand out for their slower tempo but still bring the hooks.

Ultimately, the strength of Kaiser Chiefs is their ability to create catchy, memorable songs that make you want to move. Even though ""Employment"" doesn't offer anything particularly groundbreaking or new, it's still a solid debut album from a band with a clear vision and an unique sound.","1.

Preston School of Industry,All This Sounds Gas,Rock,5.3,August 28 2001,Ryan Schreiber,Founder,"Anyone that found themselves coming of age to the sound of early 90s indie rock has a place in their heart for Pavement. Go to any ID show at your local music venue, mention the band's revered name to a stranger, and make a friend for life. But ask virtually any 16-year-old indie newcomer about Pavement's impact on their lives and record collections, and reach the bitter realization that what was once so fresh and utterly indispensable now merely passes with an ""eh."" The kids are never quick to dismiss Pavement, as the band is, and likely always will be, heralded among the founding fathers of independent rock as we know it. But somehow, the magic that once made them so vital and potent has faded with age, and just doesn't seem quite as relevant in these high-powered times as it did ten years ago. When Pavement came along with Slanted and Enchanted in 1991, it seemed a revelation: so vastly different from anything before it, and so clearly prescient of everything that would come after. Stephen Malkmus' lazy, pitch-imperfect California drawlin', Spiral Stairs' shredded almost-guitar-playing, and the album's seemingly unfinished half-songs encapsulated the slacker ethos of the time with the hyperactive, restless energy that only hits after long bouts with boredom. Pavement's stream-of-consciousness lyrics and one-take anthems achieved genius through apathy. And in a time when apathy seemed the only option in life, no one said everything by saying nothing at all like those bored Stocktonites. These days, the kids have ambition, and rightfully so. America's flush with cash and prizes, and for once, there's actual opportunity. In this age, when kids come barreling out of high school with enough computer experience to put Nolan Bushnell to shame, indifference would simply be retarded. And the current climate of independent music reflects that with bands like Sigur Rós, Godspeed You Black Emperor and Mogwai who, while all somewhat dreary at times, seem driven by an intense passion to be the best at what they do. Yes, time advances for everyone, it seems. Everyone except Scott Kannberg. Despite Pavement's demise, Kannberg still hangs on tightly to his Spiral Stairs alias, a name which seems an inside joke so closely affiliated with Pavement that it's hard to see how it could exist outside the band. Even the name of the new group he's formed with members of the Moore Brothers (a duo who finds their home on his Amazing Grease label), the Preston School of Industry, is a waning reference to an early Pavement song. It's also undoubtedly another inside joke between Pavement members, as the actual Preston School is a detention and re-education center for juvenile delinquents in Ione, California, just over 40 miles from Pavement's hometown. The music on the Preston School of Industry's debut album, All This Sounds Gas, revels in early 90s alterna-rock, a sound so exhausted it now sounds at least as generic as its equally banal predecessor, freedom rock. The only thing separating the Preston School from the Gin Blossoms is their well-worn Pavement edge. Even so, Pavement's rough-hewn absurdities have been blent with more conventional pop structures by bedroom wannabes for the past decade; the fact that the Preston School is fronted by an ex-member of the band doesn't make their music any less of a mimicry. Three of the album's tracks were written by Kannberg during the sessions for Pavement's swan-song, 1999's Terror Twilight, including the record's lead-off, ""Whalebones,"" which starts the album off nicely with the kind of lazy, repetition-based melody that should sound familiar to any Pavement addict. But while a pleasant listen, all of the youthful exuberance Kannberg displayed on his Pavement tracks-- even ones as late as Brighten the Corners' ""Date w/IKEA""-- has totally evaporated, and where the song should burst into a fiery distortion overdrive, it's content to meander on and peter out with no sign of actual effort. ""The Idea of Fires"" and the seven-minute long ""Encyclopedic Knowledge of,"" both also written in the Terror Twilight days, never seem to gain direction or rise above I-could-do-that mediocrity. While these three tracks seem passable at best, they're never downright offensive. But the uninspired country twang of ""A Treasure @ Silver Bank (This Dynasty's for Real)"" crosses that line. Senseless lyrics like, ""It's a polyester bright day now/ And the dinosaurs are for real,"" and, ""50 minutes till the muses needs/ Put you out to the trees,"" just sound so fucking wrong against the vagabond Travis Tritt backdrop. And a half-hour later, the album closes at its worst with the neverending ""Take a Stand,"" a pale Soft Bulletin imitation whose hackneyed, off-kilter beat stumbles awkwardly underneath 11,000 layers of acoustic guitar and a chorus of inept la-la-la's before the song closes with a voice proclaiming it ""a brilliant rock odyssey."" All This Sounds Gas might not have been such a weak effort if Kannberg's lyrics actually had anything to say, but nonsense prose has never meshed well with jangly, country-inflected pop. The album also might have improved, however slightly, if they'd left off the embarrassing quasi-experimental keyboard jam, ""Blü Sön,"" a 44-second excursion to Planet Shame that makes the Byrds' ""Moog Raga"" seem like a monolith of pulsing electronic genius. But, of course, they didn't, leaving All This Sounds Gas to languish in future obscurity as yet another post-legendary project that fails to live up to its frontman's glory days. Unfortunate.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6462-all-this-sounds-gas/,Matador,2001.0,"Let me start this review by saying that I've been a fan of the Preston School of Industry for years. Their unique take on rock music has always intrigued me, and I was excited to dive into their latest release, 'All This Sounds Gas'.

Before we get into the album itself, let's take a quick look at the band's history. Preston School of Industry was formed in 1999 by Spiral Stairs, the former guitarist of Pavement. The band's debut album, 'All This Sounds Gas', was released in 2001 and was met with mixed reviews from critics and fans alike.

Now, in regards to 'All This Sounds Gas', I think it's important to understand the context in which it was created. According to Spiral Stairs, the album was born out of a desire to push the boundaries of the rock genre and to explore new sounds and structures. This is evident in the album's use of electronic elements, in addition to the traditional rock band instrumentation.

As I listened to the album, I found myself drawn in by its experimental nature. Tracks like ""Falling Away"" and ""Solitaire"" showcase the band's willingness to take risks, and the result is a sound that feels fresh and exciting.

However, that's not to say that the album doesn't have its flaws. At times, I found myself wishing for a bit more cohesion between the tracks, as some of them felt disjointed and out of place. Additionally, the album's production can be a bit abrasive at times, with a rawness that may not appeal to all listeners.

Overall, I would give 'All This Sounds Gas' a 5.3 out of 10. While the album has its moments of brilliance, its shortcomings in terms of cohesion and production prevent it from being a truly exceptional work. That being said, I still appreciate Preston School of Industry's willingness to take risks and explore new sounds, and I look forward to seeing where they go next.","1.

Sick Lipstick,Sting Sting Sting,,7.8,July 10 2003,David Raposa,Contributor,"For those of you in a hurry, some quick things of note about this record: the lead vocalist sounds a lot like Bis' Manda Rin (the words ""adenoidal"" and ""bratty"" spring to mind). Most of the discernable lyrics offer themselves up as a more risquÃ© interpretation of Karen O's Sheena-is-a-bitch-in-heat shtick-- a High Society to play off the YYY's Playboy. Note the following instructions from ""Pretend I'm Sleeping"": ""I want your baby/ So you'll have to come inside me."" If you've ever heard Weasel Walter's guitar work on the Lake of Dracula album-- chunky, thick, dissonant, frantic-- you might think Sick Lipstick's guitarist owes a tithe or indulgence to Skin Graft for such sincere flattery. But the perpetual nerves that permeate this disc owe their frazzled state to the supposed Now Wave scene of the mid-90s (cf. the Scissor Girls, US Maple, Arab-on-Radar, that group of film-school drop outs opening for Blonde Redhead in 1995 wearing Q-Bert masks and tie-died hospital smocks while playing detuned E chords on guitars strung up with fishing line-- no, wait, that last group sucked ass, nevermind). As much as the supposed Now Wavers owe their MO and livelihood (relatively speaking) to No New York and Screamers bootlegs, Sick Lipstick brush against an equally well defined preexisting pedigree. This might be a good album for those of you in a hurry, though: no song on Sting Sting Sting wears out its welcome, with each of the twelve tracks working itself out in 3 minutes or less. But the best track just so happens to be the longest: ""Thigh-Master I'm Your Master"" manages to make a racket that, in epileptic circles, would qualify as ""danceable"", then builds on the racket to end the song with a convincing head of steam. The other tracks follow a similar path with little variation (though the intro to ""10-4 Can You Read Me?"" sounds more like something from Dirty than something from Here Is the Is-Not). This isn't a condemnation, though-- Sick Lipstick know what their strengths are, and they ably play to them. The lack of variation in their attack lends the proceedings a strange consistency; ""strange"" because I don't expect a band taking their cues from the sort of chaos described earlier to qualify as ""consistent."" Of course, one's fix for spastic, herky-jerky caterwauling punctuated by vocal catchphrasing might be ably sated by offerings from any of the Sick Lipstick's recent antecedents (Yummy Fur, God Is My Co-Pilot) and contemporaries (Erase Errata & related groups, The Ssion, even the Yeah Yeah Yeahs), or even the Canadian group that gave birth to this particular brand of makeup, the much more spastic and abrasive Black Cat #13, half of which comprises Sick Lipstick. If you're thirsting for this sort of aural abuse, Sting Sting Sting is a fine place to get your fix, but there's a lot of good shit in town right now; you better shop around.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7705-sting-sting-sting/,Tiger Style,2003.0,"Hey there music lovers, today I'm excited to share my thoughts on the new album ""Sting Sting Sting"" by Sick Lipstick. The band has been around since the early 2000s, hailing from Toronto, Canada, and has been known for their unique blend of punk, noise rock, and glam aesthetics. Their new album, ""Sting Sting Sting,"" builds on this distinctive style, pushing it further into the realm of dissonance and experimentation.

The album opens with the track ""Things That Make Me Feel Like Shit,"" a fittingly abrasive and confrontational introduction to the rest of the album. The lyrics, delivered in vocalist Jennifer Dunlop's trademark snarl, explore the mundane experiences of everyday life, from social anxiety to self-doubt, with an unvarnished honesty that's both relatable and uncomfortable.

As the album progresses, the band's penchant for sonic chaos becomes increasingly apparent. Guitars screech and wail over frenetic drumming, while Dunlop's vocals range from guttural screams to eerie whispers. Yet, amidst the discord, there are moments of surprising beauty; the shimmering guitars on ""Wasting Time"" and the haunting vocal harmonies on ""Blood on the Walls"" are particularly notable.

One of the highlights of ""Sting Sting Sting"" is the creative use of samples and electronic manipulation. The buzzing glitches and distorted vocals on ""Bad News"" lend a futuristic edge to the otherwise retro sound, while the eerie echoes on ""Marilyn"" create an eerie, haunted atmosphere.

However, while the album is undeniably compelling, it's not without its flaws. Some of the longer tracks, such as ""Incest Is Best"" and ""Sleazy Sex,"" drag on a bit too long, losing the momentum that makes the shorter, more focused songs work so well. And while the experimental approach is admirable, it can sometimes feel a bit like an exercise in excess, with some tracks feeling cluttered and overwhelming.

Overall, ""Sting Sting Sting"" is an ambitious and thought-provoking album that's sure to appeal to fans of noise rock, punk, and other genres that value dissonance over melody. While it's not always an easy listen, there's a raw honesty to the lyrics and a fearlessness to the band's approach that make it hard to ignore. For those willing to take the plunge, ""Sting Sting Sting"" is a rewarding and challenging experience. I'd give it a solid 7.8 out of 10.","1.

Seymore Saves the World,Seymore Saves the World,,5.8,May 14 2007,Adam Moerder,,"Geek rock's always been a pseudo-genre that stinks of stylistic hair-splitting and a cock-rock-normative mentality. Okay, so someone like Rivers Cuomo indisputably qualifies as ""nerdy,"" but take a look at rock's ""coolest"" icons--Mick Jagger's high school report card was immaculate, Led Zeppelin obsessed over Tolkien, and countless guitarists from Eddie Van Halen to Slash spent their teenage years hunched over a fretboard memorizing scales and chords. In the cafeteria of rock, the line between the nerds' and cool kids' tables appears infinitely blurrier than real world high school stratification. Then again, none of these artists ever sounded as vulnerable as Minneapolis's Seymore Saves the World, a pop rock trio seemingly doomed to relive their high school tribulations for an eternity. As their name suggests, the band revels in a Peter Parker-like transformation from zero to hero, their superpower being frontman Scott Hefte's brainy lyrics and turn-on-a-dime melodies. Joined by ex-Tapes 'n Tapes bassist Shawn Neary and drummer Shawn McGregor, the band's sound borrows a great deal from similarly wry piano-based 1990s pop artists such as the New Radicals or Fastball. However, no influence more blatantly shows through these twelve songs than Ben Folds. Like Whatever and Ever Amen..., Seymore's self-titled debut engages in a nostalgic, one-sided repartee, conjuring wince-worthy high school themes like sports (""Track Star"", ""Team Player"") and awkward teenage poetry (""Love Song"", ""The Night""). Although at times Hefte resembles the chatty ""Remember that time senior year..."" stereotype, he packs enough interesting melodies to accompany the rants. On ""Red Wing"", Hefte goes ga-ga for some girl named Mary Christmas, though the real story lies in the song's pulsating rhythm, which climaxes at a meaty fuzz-bass bridge. As well executed as these songs are, the album sorely lacks any landmarks to latch onto. The keyboard/bass/drums texture never changes throughout the album, no genre outside of piano pop is ever touched. The final third of the album especially drags, as each song ends on a show-stopping rally cry so desperate to provide closure for an album's worth of salad days nostalgia. The band's ad hoc sound makes sense considering this is, after all, one of Hefte's side bands away from the buffer Minneapolis trio Superdanger. Whereas that band's vocalist Caleb Rick has a slacker howl to complement Hefte's nasally whine, Seymore doesn't enjoy such versatility, and their self-titled album sounds like a stray piece that'd be more engaging connected to the rest of the puzzle.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10200-seymore-saves-the-world/,"Royalty, Etc.",2007.0,"If you're looking for an album that will change your life, ""Seymore Saves the World"" might not be the one. However, if you're in the mood for some light-hearted, catchy music that will put a smile on your face and make you tap your foot, then you're in the right place.

The band Seymore Saves the World, made up of lead vocalist and guitarist Seymore, bassist and keyboardist Alex, and drummer Greg have been making music together for over a decade. They've played in local bars, festivals and have amassed a loyal following in their hometown. The band's quirky name comes from Seymore's beloved dog who passed away during the recording of the album.

The album's creation story is nothing out of the ordinary. The band worked on it over the course of a year, recording in a few different studios and enlisting the help of some local musicians. The end result is an upbeat, pop-leaning collection of 10 tracks, all penned by Seymore himself.

Listening to the album, it's clear that the band had a lot of fun making it. The songs are filled with playful lyrics and catchy hooks that will stick with you long after the album has finished. Standout tracks include ""Sunshine"" with its infectious melody and ""I'm Fine"" which showcases Seymore's impressive vocal range.

Although the album doesn't break any new ground and at times verges on generic, songs like ""Goodbye"" and ""Fallen Leaves"" showcase Seymore's songwriting potential. The band's members are adept at their respective instruments, and they perform solidly throughout the album.

As someone who typically listens to indie and alternative rock, I wasn't sure if ""Seymore Saves the World"" would be up my alley, but I found myself pleasantly surprised. While it's not a groundbreaking album by any means, it's a fun and enjoyable listen that will make you want to dance around the room. I give it a solid 7 out of 10.","1.

Robert Ashley,Atalanta (Acts of God) Volume II,"Experimental,Rock",7.9,August 13 2010,Mike Powell,Contributor,"Robert Ashley's career is definitively marginal. Nothing dramatic happens in his music, and there aren't too many people who listen to it to begin with. The stories he tells are about Americans who don't cry out to have their stories told. Sometimes they're homeless or old. Sometimes they work at the bank. (They are, of course, heart-swellingly remarkable, but that's only because Ashley has a gift-- and a mission, maybe-- to make the uneventful feel mysterious and even transcendent.) In 40 years, he's rarely raised his voice on record, and though the equipment he uses to compose the music behind his stories has changed, the actual music hasn't: It's pretty, quiet, and consistent. The people in his performances, which usually include him, don't even sing, they speak in rhythmic, exaggerated voices. Actual singing would be too dramatic. Last time he performed in New York, I was inappropriately excited-- it was like tailgating for meditation. My girlfriend fell asleep 20 minutes into it and later said, ""I liked it."" In my fan's mind, I can't figure out why he isn't as famous-- or at least endlessly name-dropped-- as other dressed-down 20th-century composers like Terry Riley and Steve Reich. One of the reasons might be that there's nothing conventionally sexy or cool about his music. Despite living in New York for more than half his life, Ashley's diction and style have always made him seem grandfatherly and safe, even when he's talking about life's vast gray areas. The first paragraph of the liner notes for his new album, a companion disc to his large work Atalanta, reads, ""Without the music (and even with the music) people drop out now and then."" He knows people will fall asleep. This is Robert Ashley joking about Robert Ashley. Despite its beauty, there is nothing self-serious about his music; his sense of humor, though as quiet as everything else he does, probably blows away the expectations a typical Pitchfork reader has for 80-year-old Midwestern men or art-music composers, let alone both. But this idea of hearing music piecemeal is also a thesis about how his music works, and an expression of how radically it has affected how I listen to it-- though even saying ""I listen to it"" feels too active. When I get an album of his I haven't heard, I don't sit down and make a trip out of it. I loop it and start doing chores. A few days later, I recognize something. Then, maybe, a piece of the story dawns on me. Atalanta (Acts of God): Volume II is, again, part of a larger work whose whole pretense would take a long time to explain and actually turns me off a little, but the basic setup is Robert Ashley, Jacqueline Humbert (one of his long-time collaborators), and some synthesizers. It is two discs long, and for what it's worth, I think it's the best thing he's released in five years (and it's the sixth piece of relatively new Ashley music issued on CD this decade). My least favorite section, ""The Etchings"", lasts for 30 minutes, but I don't skip it. ""You, my dear, are the cutest little police officer I've ever seen. If you could take time from your route and step into that doorway with me for a while,"" Ashley says, before Humbert finishes his thought-- ""We could transcend the limitations of the flesh."" This is one way he writes: the vernacular against the abstract. The soda-counter philosopher. Later, he tells an allegory about corporate America, but posits it as a story about tomato ketchup. This is another way he writes: a threatening current under something that seems harmless. The last, multi-part section involves Humbert talking about a series of au pairs. At one point, a mother comes home to an open door, with the sitter-- Simone, a hot, 19-year-old French-Swiss girl ""who dressed in a decidedly New Wave direction, with gently pointed black ankle boots""-- drugged-up and post-coital. The next day the parent is filling the tub and trying to forget the still-unexplainable confusion, when the kid pushes his favorite stuffed animal into his crotch and says, ""Monkey's gonna suck my penis!"" I laughed out loud the first time I heard this, and the second. On the third, I felt worried: This is a story about the subtle nightmare of letting a stranger into your family, or of knowing your child has been exposed to something you weren't there for and can't counteract. A kid forcing his stuffed monkey to fellate him. About three years ago, I had the pleasure of meeting Robert Ashley for an interview. He gave me a small glass of potato vodka and told me a story about how the most beautiful building he had ever seen was across the street from where he lived. He still lives there, I think, off to the side.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14558-atalanta-acts-of-god-volume-ii/,Lovely,2010.0,"The second volume of Robert Ashley's Atalanta (Acts of God) is a mesmerizing exploration of experimental rock that should not be overlooked. With a rating of 7.9 out of 10, this album is a true gem that deserves to be recognized for its unique sound and thought-provoking lyrics.

For those unfamiliar with Ashley's work, let me provide a brief introduction. Ashley was a renowned American composer and musician, primarily known for his avant-garde and experimental style. He collaborated with a variety of artists from different disciplines, including choreographers, poets, and visual artists. Throughout his career, Ashley became a figurehead of the underground music scene, distinguished by his interest in electronic music and innovative use of language.

Now, let's focus on the Atalanta (Acts of God) Volume II. This album is the second part of a four-act opera created by Ashley in the 1980s, showcasing his signature style of mixing spoken word with unconventional musical arrangements. Volume II features a plethora of talented musicians that bring Ashley's eclectic vision to life, including ""Blue"" Gene Tyranny, Thomas Buckner, and Sam Ashley.

The album kicks off with the track ""The Park,"" a haunting song that sets the tone for what's to come. The eerie, synth-heavy melodies provide a perfect backdrop for Ashley's surreal lyrics, which explore the fleeting nature of existence and the meaning of identity. Tracks like ""The Backyard"" and ""The Bank"" showcase Ashley's talent for storytelling, highlighting his impressive ability to create vivid imagery through music and spoken word.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""The Wolfman,"" a funky and upbeat song that showcases Ashley's playful side. The song features an infectious bassline and a catchy chorus that will have you humming along after just one listen. ""The Wolfman"" is a fun and lighthearted departure from the album's more somber tracks, providing a much-needed moment of levity.

Overall, Atalanta (Acts of God) Volume II is a must-listen for experimental rock fans. Ashley's unique style is on full display here, showcasing his impressive ability to mix spoken word with unconventional musical arrangements. The album is a surreal and thought-provoking journey that will leave you questioning the universe and the meaning of life.

Earthless,From the Ages,"Metal,Rock",7.2,October 22 2013,Grayson Currin,Contributor,"Earthless don't leave room for misinterpretation or error concerning their mission: They are a long-winded guitar trio, hell-bent on riding six electric strings directly out of this atmosphere. No sooner than the drums unload their initial heavy hit on the band’s first album in six years—the ridiculous ripper From the Ages—Isaiah Mitchell takes his first solo, his squealing lead slashing cleanly through a vacant gaze of cymbal wash. The band soon digs back in, with drummer Mario Rubalcaba and bassist Mike Eginton instantly stitching a sturdy pocket. But it’s Mitchell that almost always edges out front in Earthless. He rides through a riff and races off into tangents for minutes on end. After that lead burst during album opener “Violence of the Red Sea,” he bends a theme a half-dozen different ways, whether retracing his lead with a wah-wah moan here or a whammy bar battle with himself there. Rubalcaba and Eginton don’t pull Mitchell back toward earth; they instead follow his ecstatic lead everywhere, fellow travelers on his odyssey of enthusiasms. Since Earthless’ last album, 2007’s Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, its members have been busy: Rubacalba has been behind the throne for new old punks OFF! and out front for San Diego pounders Spider Fever. Mitchell joined Howlin Rain for its Rick Rubin-helmed catastrophe The Russian Wilds and started the blustery, concise psych group Golden Void with some high school buddies and his wife. Mitchell actually presaged Golden Void at the end of Rhythms with the swiveling Groundhogs cover “Cherry Red”, the shortest bit of Earthless’ oeuvre by a quarter-hour. The experience of getting back into bands playing discrete tunes serves From the Ages well, as Earthless breaks the album’s hour-plus runtime into four digestible tracks. “Violence of the Red Sea” syncs well with “Uluru Rock”, a smoldering tune that’s steadily fanned until it leaps into flames. By trek’s end, the rhythm section’s beating back hard against Mitchell, his fingers bouncing between notes as though his hands are the levers and posts of a pinball machine. “Equus October” indulges a cosmic drift, with the bass leading the Om-like way for circular drums and a twilit haze of electrostatic ambiance. It’s an uncharacteristically subdued side of Earthless. As such, it only last five minutes. The closing title track, however, burns on for more than half an hour. It’s the sum of everything before it, not only in length but also in the establishment of a structure and dynamic that allow the span to be an epic, not just another tedious bro jam. The trio roars at the start, drums and bass thrashing behind Mitchell’s lead. They shift into a viscous blues bounce and then into a great astral smear, eventually riding an Arabian riff into a meditative rumble. The guitar lines waft like smoke across an empty field. Earthless sit still a bit too long here; remarkably, this is the one moment of From the Ages where the band’s patience might test your own. But they come roaring back, driving into a coda that’s heavier than anything they’ve ever done. All the solos and sidetracks collapse into one brilliant exit. A journey meant for getting lost suddenly makes good on the destination. In 2013, the place and purpose of acts like Earthless or Endless Boogie elicit some interesting questions about genre and intent. These are essentially roadhouse bands, capable of stretching a rock'n'roll theme from here to infinity. But when so many of us can’t pay attention enough to engage with an entire album, is there a need for an hour of three dudes tracing and retracing a melody? Does this digressive stuff work only on stage, where a few beers and a few puffs have softened everyone’s focus enough to sink into solo after solo after solo? Is this the jurisdiction of jam bands, in the most cynical and checked-out sense? To an extent, yes: Earthless’ music—not unlike that of Sleep or Bardo Pond or Eternal Tapestry or, you know, The Grateful Dead—requires a certain suspension of now, a commitment to and comfort with being ferried away for however long they please. But From the Ages is more a reminder of the fun that can be had with the most basic elements of rock, too. This is the atavistic magic of three people locked in a room only with their instruments and each other, eyes closed, and mouths open. Earthless are incredibly indulgent, sometimes to a fault, but they’re much too excitable to be called selfish or masturbatory. The dudes are once again just riffing here. It’s a trip worth taking, at least a few times.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18558-earthless-from-the-ages/,Tee Pee,2013.0,"From the start, Earthless's latest offering ""From the Ages"" ignites a fiery passion within listeners. With its shredding guitars, pounding drums, and seamlessly blended metal and rock elements, it's sure to get heads banging and fists pumping. At its core, this album screams raw power and energy - a truly unique sonic experience that's hard to replicate in today's music scene. 

For those unfamiliar with Earthless, the band was formed in San Diego in 2001 and is composed of guitarist Isaiah Mitchell, bassist Mike Eginton, and drummer Mario Rubalcaba. Their sound is heavily influenced by classic rock and metal, but they have managed to create a distinct sound of their own, combining psychedelic elements and extended instrumental sections. This album is a testament to their technical prowess and musicianship, which has only improved with time.

""From the Ages"" serves as a testament to the band's growth and development as a unit. They have always been known for their epic instrumentals, and this album is no exception. The album's lead track, ""Violence of the Red Sea,"" kicks off with an extended instrumental introduction, showcasing not only their technical skill but also their ability to create a vast soundscape that's both mesmerizing and enthralling. As the song progresses, it builds to an intense crescendo that's sure to give you goosebumps.

As someone who has been following Earthless for some time now, I can confidently say that this album is a true work of art. What sets it apart from their previous releases is the fact that it was recorded in a single week-long session, live in the studio, without any overdubs or corrections. This approach may seem unconventional, but it has undoubtedly paid off. The result is an album that feels alive and raw, with each track creating a unique atmosphere that captivates the listener.

That being said, not every track on the album is a hit for me. ""Uluru Rock,"" for example, felt a bit repetitive and lacked the same dynamic energy as some of the other tracks. However, this is just a minor flaw in an otherwise excellent piece of work.

In conclusion, ""From the Ages"" is a testament to Earthless's immense talent, and it's an album that's sure to go down in history. The band's ability to intertwine metal and rock elements into their music, along with an incredible live sound, is a testament to their dedication and passion for their craft. If you're a fan of classic rock and metal, you'll find plenty to love in this album, and I highly recommend giving it a listen. This album earns a solid 7.2 out of 10 rating, as it showcases the band's musical prowess and their ability to create a unique sound that sets them apart from other rock and metal bands.","Step 1: Both reviews provide a summary of the album ""From the Ages"" by Earthless, mentioning the band's signature sound that blends rock and metal elements with psychedelic and extended instrumental sections.

Fetty Wap,Bruce Wayne,Rap,5.4,June 13 2018,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"Fetty Wap broke through doing pop rap things only Eminem and Lil Wayne had done, but now he only ever makes headlines when trading barbs with mayoral candidates in his hometown, or when drag racing his Mercedes CLS AMG drunk on a suspended license, or when people are facetiously petitioning to have him perform “Trap Queen” at Nancy Reagan’s funeral. His new mixtape, Bruce Wayne, is an attempt to change the narrative. In the intro, scanning a radio dial produces nothing but his biggest songs, before segueing into Wayne’s “So Different”—the implication being he’s still making hits. The tape, named after Batman’s absurdly rich business-inheriting alter ego, aims to draw a flimsy parallel between Fetty and a billionaire crime-fighting superhero: Like Wayne, he suggests, he uses his power and status to give back to his community. (It’s worth noting that Wayne also poses as a superficial playboy as a cover for his late-night heroics.) “I am Bruce Wayne, I’ve done a lot for people,” Fetty told Complex. “It’s not about bragging, but inspiring people to always give back.” The mixtape, released on his birthday and dedicated to his late grandparents Bishop Willie Lee Maxwell and James Eugene Hagans, is often exactly the opposite of what he claims—full of empty swag raps like, “A million in my bank, hunnid in my jeans, baby/I don’t mean to brag but they know it’s me, baby,” on a song literally called “Westin”—but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Its real problems are twofold and compounding: Fetty is an often lazy writer-performer who has lost command of his once stirring voice. Though “Trap Queen” approached romance from an exciting new angle, turning an unlikely setting into the perfect space for an outpouring of affection, Fetty has never been much of a songwriter. His Pyrex sonnets and lullabies relied almost entirely on his wailing croons to convey tenderness and devotion. In the mixtapes and EPs released since 2016, he’s struggled to find the same mastery that made songs like “My Way” and “679” so potent, dipping more into barefaced raps and singing with far less zeal. Bruce Wayne continues Fetty’s steady decline from promising trap balladeer to one-dimensional chant rapper. His themes are largely the same but executed more poorly. Most of these songs have one meandering verse that goes nowhere. The hooks are way less catchy, and too often he’s prone to saying the most basic thing. Even his Batman angle is somewhat simple-minded and ineffective: “Let a nigga know, is it beef, is it beef?/Somethin’ in the air, Batman in the streets/Jordan 14s, Batman on my feet/Bitch I’m Bruce Wayne, stock’s up, come and see,” he raps on the title track. Contrary to what he claims, the market says otherwise. In Fetty’s best moments, which, coincidentally, were also his biggest successes, he was a real ham. He sang like he was proposing in a crowded restaurant, performing not just for his lover but anyone watching. Bruce Wayne is far more muted and understated, especially on “So Different,” which slaps the “Hotline Bling” drums onto moodier synths as Fetty murmurs half-assed come-ons like “He a worker, I’ma boss now/You should know the difference.” But there are some flashes of those same garish tendencies that once made him trap’s Sisqo. The verse on “What We Do” explodes into howling, using its moaned pleas to coax a girlfriend into a threesome. “I love your face, your eyes, your style/Baby, if you with a vacay pick an island,” he warbles on “Look at Me.” There are moments where his subdued manner works, too, like the gleaming “Star Struck” or the closer “Hit Some Corners.” But for most of Bruce Wayne’s 28 minutes, there’s nothing really worth relishing. Where Fetty’s histrionic performances once demanded attention, these largely bore. Stranger things have happened, but it’s hard to see a path back to ubiquity for Fetty Wap. It took a collab with both 6ix9ine and A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie for him to even sniff the Top 40 for the first time in two years. Time has revealed him to be a flash in the pan; though more than the “one-hit wonder” he is sometimes made out to be, he burned himself out quickly and he has already maximized the utility of his only weapon. Across Bruce Wayne, on inert R&B tunes like “All for You” and “Wavy,” he tinkers with new interpretations of his old songs trying, to find something that works. His commitment is admirable, but simply listening to the tape is an act of charity.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fetty-wap-bruce-wayne/,"300 Entertainment,RGF",2018.0,"If you're a fan of Fetty Wap, you'll definitely want to give his latest album, 'Bruce Wayne,' a listen. It's been a few years since Fetty's debut album, which made waves with hits like ""Trap Queen"" and ""679."" But the rapper has been keeping busy, and this latest release shows that he's not slowing down anytime soon.

'Bruce Wayne' is a rap album with a mix of beats and flows that reflects the rapper's eclectic style. It incorporates upbeat dance tracks and slower, introspective songs, showcasing a range of emotions and themes.

One thing that stands out about the album is the creativity behind it. As the story goes, Fetty Wap decided to name the album 'Bruce Wayne' to pay homage to the famous comic book character, who is known for his double identity as both Batman and billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. This concept is reflected in the album's art, which portrays Fetty Wap as both himself and a superhero. It's a unique and refreshing approach, and it makes the album stand out from others in the genre.

One of the standout tracks on 'Bruce Wayne' is ""Couple Bandz,"" which features mellow guitar riffs and smooth vocals from the rapper. The lyrics address themes of loyalty, love, and the struggle of making it in the music industry. Another highlight is ""Black & Decker,"" which boasts a catchy hook and a more upbeat, almost danceable rhythm. The lyrics mix braggadocio with introspection, as Fetty Wap reflects on the ups and downs of life.

Despite these bright spots, 'Bruce Wayne' suffers from some weaknesses as well. For one thing, there are a few tracks that feel repetitive, and the beats can sound a bit generic at times. Additionally, some of the lyrical themes, such as the glorification of drug use, can be off-putting to some listeners.

Overall, 'Bruce Wayne' is a solid effort from Fetty Wap, but it's not his strongest work to date. While it has some memorable tracks, there are a few forgettable moments as well. That said, it's clear that the rapper has put a lot of heart and creativity into this album, and that alone makes it worth a listen. If you're a fan of rap, or if you're looking for something new and exciting, give 'Bruce Wayne' a try - just don't expect it to be a masterpiece.","1.

Ethan Gold,Songs From a Toxic Apartment,Rock,7.2,February 23 2011,Martin Douglas,Contributor,"The opening sequence to Ethan Gold's Songs From a Toxic Apartment is almost too fitting: a once-empty hallway punctured by a series of sharp footsteps, the rattling of house keys, and the opening and shutting of a creaky door. By the time the song, ""Why Don't You Sleep?"", gets to its soaring chorus, it paints a perfect picture of the insomnia and desire for escape that color the album. While immersed in recording demos for another project, Ethan Gold's physical health quickly deteriorated. He later learned his residence had been besieged by a variety of poisons before the health department considered the apartment unlivable. The titular ""toxic apartment"" was frighteningly literal, forcing Gold to move his recording setup-- and the rest of his belongings. As the title suggests, the album was recorded in full in his apartment (though thankfully not in the one littered with flakes of asbestos). You wouldn't know it from listening, however. Gold's production prowess first came to the fore on Elvis Perkins' debut album, Ash Wednesday-- a close companion of this record in terms of emotional and existential distress. So Songs is not so much lo-fi as it is low-budget. Nothing on the record bears the mild sterility of a professional studio, while snatches of white noise and sounds from outside of Gold's living room window are subtly filtered into the songs. Naturally, most of the tracks that make up Songs From a Toxic Apartment deal with toxicity in the emotional sense. On ""Poison"", Gold's emotions are sent into a whirlwind as he asks for salvation and tries to stay motivated as the devil stares him down and his relationships are damaged by sex. The album has a childlike emotional purity to it, but that's not to say that it's immature or naïve. Instead, it's rooted in the fact that children don't obscure their hurt by anger or bravado or even mock diffidence, as adults often do. Occasionally, the songs are bogged down by grating lyrics or unnecessary bridges (such as on the breakdown in ""I.C.U. (Toxic)""), but for the most part, the emotions on Songs From a Toxic Apartment are delivered with an unfiltered, glaring legibility. ""Are We Recording?"" finds Gold tangled up in nerves and hunched over his mixing board, facing his self-doubt with fears like, ""We don't know what we're doing yet."" The fears exists even when he thinks he locates his artistic muse: He is quietly huddled in a corner, softly strumming a guitar during ""That (Reprise)"", singing, ""This is what I am,"" before letting out a long sigh. During ""Royal Flush"", he compares love to an intense game of poker, breathing in stale air and staring across the table at someone inscrutably surveying the five cards in their hand. Songs From a Toxic Apartment is a one-act play whose scenes are cast by one bright spotlight and minimal set changes. On closer ""To Isis Sleeping"", Gold tests his use of dynamics by introducing countermelodies and pulling them away after a moment's notice right up until the dramatic finish, as the instruments fade out into the sprinkling drops of water falling into the shower floor and running down the drain. And just like that, the curtain closes on the toxic apartment, and you're left with your own four walls staring you down.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15092-songs-from-a-toxic-apartment/,Self-released,2011.0,"There are certain albums that really hit home with their audience, and Ethan Gold's 'Songs From a Toxic Apartment' is definitely one of them. As a fan of rock music, I was really excited to listen to this album and I can honestly say it did not disappoint. With a rating of 7.2 out of 10, this album has been gaining traction in the music scene and I can totally see why.

Firstly, let's talk about the history of the band. Ethan Gold is no stranger to the world of music, having been in the industry for years. His previous albums have received critical acclaim, and this new album is no different. However, what sets this album apart is the personal touch that Ethan has added to it. As the title suggests, the album was created in the midst of hardship, while Gold was dealing with the aftermath of a toxic relationship. This album, therefore, is Gold's way of channeling his emotions and turning them into art, and the result is nothing short of breathtaking.

From the very first track, 'Not Me. Us', the listener is entranced by the unique blend of rock and other genres put together in a seamless manner. The album carries an undeniable sense of vulnerability, but also one of resilience and determination to power through whatever life throws your way. One of my personal favorite tracks is 'Our Love Is Beautiful', which showcases Ethan's vocal prowess and the way he can really connect with listeners on a deeply emotional level.

One really cool aspect of this album is how it manages to take something difficult and turn it into something positive. The creation of 'Songs From a Toxic Apartment' may have been born out of a negative experience, but the end result is a series of tracks that speak to so many people and offer a healing experience. When listening to this album, I had moments where I felt a deep sense of connection with Ethan, almost like he was speaking directly to me through his music.

In conclusion, 'Songs From a Toxic Apartment' is an incredible album that is bound to take the music world by storm. Ethan Gold's songwriting and production skills are on full display here, and the result is an album that is both deeply personal and universally relatable. Whether you're a fan of rock music or not, I highly recommend giving this album a listen - you won't regret it.","Step 1: Review A is longer and more detailed, providing specific examples and descriptions of the album and its tracks.

Pauline Oliveros,Four Meditations / Sound Geometries,"Electronic,Experimental,Rock",7.4,July 22 2016,Marc Masters,Contributor,"Pauline Oliveros is a virtuoso at creating environments for musicians to explore. The legendary 84-year old composer, accordionist, and electronic pioneer is perhaps best known for her tape experiments from the ’60s, but her musical scores are just as innovative. Most of them contain text rather than musical notation, and eschew hard-and-fast directions in favor of poetic guidelines to be interpreted. In other words, she doesn’t tell people what to play, but how to play—and just as importantly, how to listen. Given this creative freedom, her collaborators often respond with something that’s less like music to passively listen to than spaces your mind can enter and probe. The two lengthy pieces on *Four Meditations / Sound Geometries *are prime examples of how Oliveros conjures three-dimensional worlds from simple words on a page. In the case of “Sound Geometries,” the music is literally 3-D, as Oliveros filters the sounds of Belgian ensemble Musique Nouvelles through her surround-sound based Expanded Instrument System. “Four Meditations” is wide and deep, too, due in part to the liberty she grants the musicians. As Oliveros puts it in her score, “Since there is no written part to watch, all the performers’ attention can be given to sound and invention.” The main focus of attention for listeners of “Four Meditations” will likely be the voice of Ione, Oliveros’ long-time collaborator. Though her fellow musicians all make vital contributions, Ione’s vocals are like a bright star around which all other sounds orbit. She’s adept at glossolalia-like stretches of abstract sound, improvising in the same league as expert voice experimenters such as Yoko Ono and C. Spencer Yeh. But her use of literal language is just as important. At one point Ione slowly intones “I am who I am,” then flips that into “I am who you are,” seeming to comment on music that inverts definitions and blurs boundaries. In fact, much of “Four Meditations” is about convergence and divergence, as the musicians continually connect and separate. In that sense, Oliveros’ guidelines for a section called “The Tuning Meditation”*—*where she gives musicians the option of “playing a pitch that no one else is playing,” “just listening,” or “tuning in unison”—pretty well characterizes the entirety of “Four Meditations.” A similar dynamic marks “Sound Geometries,” but its effects are subtler. Compared to “Four Mediations,” it’s more familiar sounding, at times evoking a well-honed jazz group. All the rolling horns, pointillist piano, and moaning strings are continually inventive, though sometimes easy to lose track of (one movement bears the apt title “Arriving Anywhere, Nowhere, Somewhere”). But that just means you have to listen closely to discover the riches of “Sound Geometries,” something that Oliveros—who, after all, created an entire institute called Deep Listening—surely intended. It’s rather stunning that work this open and free of constraint can sound so calm. Though the tension that comes from loud, energetic improv can be thrilling, there’s something equally compelling about music that applies pressure while maintaining patience. The best word for it is probably “hypnotic,” but that doesn’t do justice to the way Oliveros puts a spell on your ears. She draws you so far into the environment of *Four Meditations / Sound Geometries *that you might forget you don’t actually live there.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22158-four-meditations-sound-geometries/,Sub Rosa,2016.0,"Pauline Oliveros is a name that rings out throughout the avant-garde music world, and her latest album, ""Four Meditations / Sound Geometries"" is yet another example of her intense creativity and musical prowess. Oliveros has been making experimental music for more than 50 years, and her latest release showcases her ingenuity and dedication to her craft.

""Four Meditations / Sound Geometries"" is a unique blend of electronic, experimental, and rock, and while it may not be for every listener, there are plenty of reasons to dive into this fascinating album. The album consists of four tracks that are all drastically different from one another, yet all share a common thread of otherworldly ambience that is both calming and thought-provoking.

The first track, ""Meditation for Orchestra & Tape, Electronic Sound Installations,"" sets the tone for the rest of the album with its sweeping, ethereal notes that flow in and out of each other, creating a mesmerizing soundscape. Oliveros' use of tape and electronics adds an eerie quality to the track, making it feel as if you've been transported to another dimension.

The second track, ""Meditation for Rock & Orchestra, Electronic Sound Installations,"" takes a more experimental turn by blending rock elements with classical instrumentation. The dissonant guitars and string section work together harmoniously, creating a unique sonic landscape that twists and turns at every corner. The addition of electronic sounds adds yet another layer of intrigue to the track, making it one of the highlights of the album.

The third track, ""Sound Geometries for Chamber Orchestra, Expanded Instrument System & Expanded Instrument System,"" is a haunting piece that utilizes space and texture in intriguing ways. The use of raw strings and minimal electronic sounds creates a moody atmosphere that is full of tension and unease. Despite its unconventional nature, this track is quite beautiful in its own right.

The final track, ""Meditation for Soloist, Mixed Choir & Orchestra, Electronic Sound Installations,"" is a sprawling piece that features Oliveros' signature accordion alongside a chorus and full orchestra. It's a breathtaking conclusion to the album, with Oliveros' accordion weaving in and out of the choir and orchestra, creating a sense of unity and harmony that is simply stunning.

Overall, ""Four Meditations / Sound Geometries"" is a fascinating and rewarding listen for those looking for something outside of the mainstream. While it's not the most accessible album out there, those who take the time to explore its depths will be rewarded with a sonic journey like no other. I highly recommend this album for anyone looking to expand their musical horizons and experience the work of one of the most talented and innovative musicians of our time.

Gogol Bordello,Multi Kontra Culti Vs. Irony,Rock,5.2,April 1 2003,Michael Idov,,"Eugene Hutz would very much like you to know he's Ukrainian. Or Serb, Russian, Gypsy, whatever: he's from over there and rocks the 'stache to prove it. A self-exoticizing project that brought oompah-punk to downtown NYC, his Gogol Bordello exude the precise kind of gleeful inauthenticity that gets the hipsters horny. The overarching mood is that of a wasted shotgun wedding in the Karpaty, but guests on both sides of the puke-flecked altar wear vintage corduroys and wouldn't know their rakiya from their gorilka. Mind you, this is not a bad thing: Nikolai Gogol himself used his Ukrainian heritage primarily for flavor, and did his best writing in Rome. Bordello compensate for their calculated image with true immigrant work ethic-- for years, they'd tear up any club that would risk booking them, and Hutz's weekly DJ stint is still, improbably, on. The band's debut CD, Voi-La Intruder, couldn't possibly recreate their onstage freneticism and hunger; for that, it would had to have come packaged with a Stoli and a blunt, but it toiled hard for its money all the same. Production was near-absent: fiddles and accordions waged a shoving match for the studio's seemingly lone microphone; on top of the racket, Hutz made like a winterized Nick Cave, gutturally imploring the listener to ""start wearing purple for me now"". The sophomore Multi Kontra Culti Vs. Irony is a much more realized record: Bordello's blend of punk, folk, cabaret and what the Russians call ""cruel romance"" music is now smoother and more organic. Alas, as the band blew up in the intervening years, so did its ultimate ambition to become the world's next Manu Chao. A mere party record wouldn't cut it, and judging from the successes of Clandestino and Antibalas, we like our funk cut up with agitprop. Hutz and Co. are only too happy to oblige, and Multi Kontra Culti finds the crew deploying their ESL vocabulary in the service of vague political tirades. Where Voi-La spun drunken tales of green card marriages, the new record feigns rage against fashionable bogeymen of globalization and, well, irony. To make matters worse, Gogol Bordello feel the need to constantly mention their masterplan for fear we won't connect the dots: a mildly raucous number is called ""Punk Rock Parranda"" as insurance. A song that's equal parts punk and gypsy waltz earns the name ""Hopping on a Pogo Gypsy Stick"", which is less a title than a ready-made blurb. That's mighty media-conscious, coming from people whose website places the press links over a graphic of an unspooling toilet paper roll. Buy it if you must, but the only sensible thing to do with grand anti-irony proclamations is, of course, to read them as irony. Gogol Bordello lack anything resembling an actual platform: when Hutz sings ""Let's get radical / Not ironic,"" he doesn't propose a specific brand of radicalism, he just floats a buzzword that happens to occupy his orbit, like ""green card"", ""contraband"", ""punk"", ""passport"" and ""gypsy"". Typifying ambitious immigrants, Gogol Bordello have quickly learned how to sell old wares in their new environment.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3494-multi-kontra-culti-vs-irony/,Rubric,2002.0,"Gogol Bordello is a band that defies genre classification. Their sound is an eclectic mix of folk, punk, and world music that creates a high-energy frenzy that leaves audiences breathless. Their third studio album, ""Multi Kontra Culti Vs. Irony,"" released in 2002, is no exception to this rule.

The band was formed in 1999 by Eugene Hütz, an immigrant from Ukraine, who had a passion for the gypsy and punk sounds he grew up with. He formed Gogol Bordello as a way to celebrate these sounds, merging them with elements of reggae, ska, and metal. The band's unique sound and dynamic live performances quickly gained them a cult following in New York City's underground punk scene.

""Multi Kontra Culti Vs. Irony"" was recorded and produced in a crumpled and overloaded studio located in Berlin, Germany. The album comprises 16 electrifying tracks, each one more exhilarating than the last. The instrumentation on this album is as eclectic as the band itself, with a blend of accordion, violins, and percussion that immerses the listener in a sea of frenzied musical sounds.

From the opening track, ""When The Trickster Starts A-Poking,"" to the closing track, ""Copycat,"" the album takes you on a wild journey of non-stop energy and raw emotion. Each song stands on its own as a masterpiece, but the overall package is even greater. This album is a true embodiment of the band's unique sound and spirit.

Personal impressions of this album are incredibly positive. ""Multi Kontra Culti Vs. Irony"" is an album that defies classification and brings together elements of so many different genres that it's hard to get bored with it. Each track offers a new experience that's as exciting and unique as the last.

Overall, while some critics may not appreciate Gogol Bordello's unconventional sound, ""Multi Kontra Culti Vs. Irony"" is an album that should be deeply appreciated by true music enthusiasts.

OBN IIIs,Third Time to Harm,,7.0,June 5 2014,Evan Minsker,Deputy News Editor,"The current landscape of garage rock is overrun by bands who find heroes in Sabbath and the Stooges, so it's rare in 2014 to find an artist that invokes the masters of ultra-mainstream radio rock from the late 1970s and early 1980s, a sub-genre that the comedian Marc Maron recently described as townie music. We're talking Van Halen, AC/DC, Skynyrd, Nugent, ZZ Top—bands that binged on masculinity and guitar heroics and made hit records that sounded really good when they were played loudly. They made songs that were ideal for pushing the speed limit, lifting weights, getting in bar fights, flirtin' with disaster, and for those moments where you ain't talkin' 'bout love. This aesthetic void is handily filled by Austin shredders OBN IIIs, who revel in their own pose. They once made a music video in which all of the members murdered each other for the purpose of stealing booze and record money. On the cover of their new album, Third Time to Harm, frontman Orville Bateman Neeley III is flipping triple birds. They're surly in all their surface imagery, their lyrics are plenty macho, and sure enough, that churlishness finds its way into their beefy sound. ""No Time for the Blues"" is a roaring roadhouse burner that finds a welcome place in the canon of songs for driving way too fast. Neeley blurts a few brusque, blunt screams of ""NO"", and the band tear through a few guitar solos. Drank-too-much anthem ""The Rockin' Spins"" packs a chugging melody and bluesy harmonica flourishes; later, they veer toward Blue Öyster Cult-esque mysticism with ""Beg to Christ"". It's an album heavy on momentum, shredding, and, yes, balls. But much like the lords of townie rock before them, OBN IIIs pose a specific challenge: although they deliver some genuinely exciting, all-American rock'n'roll music, they require their listeners to clear some boneheaded lyrical hurdles, too. ""Uncle Powderbag"" is as sleazy as its title implies, while ""Queen Glom"" is about a woman who mimics your thoughts, steals your friends, ""borrows"" money, and so on. That song comes across as especially mean-spirited when Neeley describes the woman in question in overly chauvinistic terms (""She'll even glom on to your dick""). Third Time to Harm isn't unmatched in its thrilling-yet-troglodyte outlook—it pairs well with the Timmy's Organism album Raw Sewage Roq, which had similarly sketchy gender politics paired with muscle-headed barroom rock'n'roll. On OBN IIIs' ""Worries"", though, it's hard not to draw comparisons to early Van Halen—Neeley's voice recalls David Lee Roth's baritone register while additional voices echo the chorus in unison. There's also a huge guitar solo, naturally. In a way, it's a shame that Third Time to Harm came out in 2014: in 1980, this thing would've been a mainstay in teen boys' tape decks everywhere.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19375-obn-iiis-third-time-to-harm/,Tic Tac Totally,2014.0,"Hey there music enthusiasts, have you heard OBN IIIs' Third Time to Harm yet? This Texas based band with years of experience in the scene is back with their 2014 release, and let me tell you, it's a rather interesting album. 

For those who may not be familiar with the band's background, OBN IIIs (which stands for Orville Bateman Neeley III) formed in 2009 and have since gained a reputation for their high-energy live shows and vintage punk rock sound. Similar to their past work, Third Time to Harm continues to showcase their style of frenzied guitar riffs, wailing vocals, and heavy drum beats.

The album's creation story began with frontman Orville Neeley's desire to bring his band's live energy into the recording studio. Third Time to Harm was recorded in Austin, Texas with the band's live show in mind. From the opening track ""No Time For The Blues"" to the final song ""The Rockin' Spins,"" the album captures the raw intensity of an OBN IIIs concert.

Listening to Third Time to Harm, it's clear that OBN IIIs is a band that takes pride in their no-frills approach to making music. There's no attempt to conform to the mainstream or experiment with new sounds here. Instead, the band is comfortable in their own skin, knowing what they do best and embracing it fully.

The album's standout tracks include ""Uncle Powderbag,"" a track that features an explosive guitar solo, and ""Milkman,"" a song that has a catchy riff that's sure to get stuck in your head. The final track ""The Rockin' Spins"" is a fitting end to the album, with Neeley and company going all out in a long, raucous jam session.

Personally, I found Third Time to Harm to be a solid effort from OBN IIIs. While the album does not break new ground or offer anything particularly revolutionary, it's still an enjoyable listen. The band's commitment to their roots is commendable, and their live performance energy is certainly captured on this record. 

Overall, I would give Third Time to Harm a rating of 7.0 out of 10. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for fans of punk rock and guitar-heavy music, this album is definitely worth a listen.","1. Review A uses more descriptive and creative language, with vivid details and comparisons.

Hodgy,Dena Tape 2,Rap,5.7,February 26 2015,Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,"The first skit on Dena Tape 2, Hodgy Beats's first full-length since 2010, will induce déjà vu in hardcore Odd Future fans. A hopeless stan approaches Hodgy for a photo at what sounds like the annual Odd Future carnival, in much the same manner as the fans who accosted Tyler, the Creator at Six Flags on the OF mastermind's ""Colossus"". Tyler’s song went on to explore the dicey relationship between artists and fans who take their every word as gospel, but Hodgy doesn't seem to have given the issue quite as much thought. Rather than dig into the skit, or go anywhere with it, he regards the fan with total contempt and excuses himself, promising to return. A couple of tracks later, in the skit’s sequel, he’s schooling us on his favorite hash, the pesky admirer abandoned and long-forgotten. Gerard Damien Long has never displayed the commitment of others in his camp, preferring instead to leap from idea to idea as fast as his jagged, lightning bolt flow will take him. On his new tape, despite his clear effort to inject some substance into his work, what we see is largely more of the same. As always, Hodgy excels at blasé funtime rap, replete with guns and drugs and sex and little in the way of effective personal exploration or storytelling. Hodgy’s efforts to grow have been the selling point of the tape, and it’s quite obvious when he’s trying to show that he’s matured: on ""Cudda Been"", ""Moneyball"" and ""HakuemeniB"" he drops his usual demonic grin and raps solemnly over beats originally used by Lupe Fiasco, Kendrick Lamar and OutKast. But Hodgy has trouble channeling the spirits of these more thoughtful rappers, and his stabs at frank discussion come across as discombobulated and unfocused. At one point on ""Moneyball"" he dedicates a couple of bars to an unclear thought about the relationship between greed and President Obama. Either he doesn’t care to work out what he’s trying to say, or he isn’t really trying to say anything at all. In any case, the next line begins a short discussion of his relationship with a stripper. Hodgy explains his own personality on the best of these tracks, ""HakuemeniB"", giving us some insight into his weaknesses on wax. He admits to being compulsive and heated, and generally comes across as a hedonist with a heart of gold. It follows, then, that he remains best over punchy, percussive beats. On Dena Tape 2, he slays tracks like ""Da Man"" and ""Wild Boy"" through a light-fingered flow reminiscent of Azealia Banks at her most agile. Like Banks, Hodgy is purposively provocative, but there isn’t any particular ideological force driving his edgier rhymes, which are often racial jabs like ""Asian eyes like a nigga rap for rice."" (It's worth mentioning that he's part Filipino.) He simply thrives on mayhem, and when fenced in by highly structured, rhythmic production, he shines. The original Dena Tape was the first solo project ever released under the crew’s umbrella, according to the Odd Future subreddit. Since that time, Hodgy’s had a son, grown from the age of 19 to 24, and released or been featured on over a dozen tapes. And yet it seems like he can’t help but to keep things light. To celebrate himself rather than think about his failings, to toss off an easy punch line instead of working to craft a complex thought, and to mock his loser fans rather than genuinely try to understand, explore or even warrant their admiration. After more than five years, he still comes across as one of the lost boys, happily treading water in Neverland and still not all the way willing to grow up.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20300-dena-tape-2/,Odd Future,2015.0,"Hey music lovers! Today, I want to introduce you to 'Dena Tape 2' by the talented rapper Hodgy. Despite its 5.7 rating, this album is a hidden gem that showcases Hodgy's growth and evolution as an artist.

Before we dive into the music, let's talk about Hodgy's history. You may know him as part of the hip-hop collective Odd Future, but Hodgy has been making music for over a decade, proving his longevity in the industry. With 'Dena Tape 2', Hodgy further solidifies his unique sound while offering a peek into his journey as an artist. 

The album itself is the result of long and hard work, with Hodgy creating it entirely on his own. He produced the beats, wrote the lyrics, and recorded the album in his home studio. This level of dedication and authenticity is evident in the final product.

Now, let's talk about the music. 'Dena Tape 2' is a mix of introspective and upbeat tracks that showcase Hodgy's versatility. The beats are unique and experimental, with unexpected elements like distorted vocals and off-kilter rhythms. Hodgy's lyrics are deeply personal, touching on themes of self-reflection and growth. 

The album's standout track is 'Words Mean Nothing', a haunting song with a slow and steady bassline that perfectly complements Hodgy's introspective lyrics. Another favorite of mine is 'Be Here', a more upbeat track that displays Hodgy's impressive flow and lyrical prowess.

Despite the album's strengths, there are a few moments where the production feels disjointed, and some tracks stand out as weaker than the others. However, these moments don't detract from the overall quality of 'Dena Tape 2'.

Cities,Cities,Rock,5.9,May 9 2006,Jason Crock,,"From the first few notes of Cities' self-titled debut, you know what you're in for-- a few stark notes of guitar under heavy reverb, some galloping high-hat, and strained, theatrical vocals. Collectively, it's reminiscent of the oft-cited college-rock milestones of the 1980s (once more with feeling): Joy Division, Echo & the Bunnymen, and R.E.M. If that's a sound you're jonesing for, Cities can mash that particular button. They plow through their revival on all cylinders, eschewing the minimal and heavy-handed style of similar artists like Interpol in favor of inertia; the band rarely stops to catch its breath over the album's 10 tracks. But a copy of a copy always gets harder to read, and I'm still squinting at Cities' debut for any sign of personality. Cities add a Western gallop to opener ""A Theme"" and an amphetamine rush to the strumming of ""Lakes"", but both just scratch the surface of their influences, showing plenty of verve but not much in the way of dynamics or memorable melodies. They do, however, feature lots of slipping in and out of ""passionate"" falsetto from singer Josh Nowlan, particularly on ""Lakes"" and ""OOC"". (Full disclosure: They also feature former Pitchfork staffer Rob Mackey.) I'd like to say Nowlan is spiking the band's watery punch with an effeminate streak borrowed from of Michael Stipe or Jeff Buckley (rather than, y'know, Chris Martin), but nothing here implies they're quite that discerning. Cities practically revel in their meat-and-potatoes approach. ""Cons, Thieves, and Murderers"" is a sparser, less strum-happy highlight that's buoyed by stick-clanging drums. More switch-ups like that from the rhythm section could have lifted this record to higher peaks (why do those trailing behind Interpol never realize the band's secret weapon?), but just ""Cons"" and ""OOC"" have much interplay between the band. More common are tracks like the angst-ridden closer ""Barricades & Garrisons"", its build-and-release too predictable to be cathartic. Chalk it up to tentative steps on a debut LP, but calling Cities workmanlike is almost being too generous-- albums like this make Editors sound innovative. Too polished for the garage, but too complacent to be ready for the bright lights, Cities have a long way to go. ",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1836-cities/,Yep Roc,2006.0,"Cities, the self-titled album by the rock band Cities, is an interesting and thought-provoking encapsulation of the band's history and evolution. The album features 11 tracks, with a total runtime of 38 minutes, and received a rating of 5.9 out of 10, which may seem underwhelming at first glance, but I'm convinced that this band has created something truly unique and worth experiencing.

Cities was formed in 2005 by five friends who shared a passion for music, but it wasn't until 2007 that they released their first album, Cities. This debut album was well received but it was with the release of their self-titled album in 2011 that the band really made a name for themselves. The process behind the creation of this album is fascinating, as the band members faced a multitude of personal struggles and obstacles while composing and performing these tracks.

Listening to the album itself, it's clear that Cities is heavily influenced by classic rock bands of the 70s and 80s, such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Doors, mixed with a touch of modern indie rock. The tracks are a mix of heavy guitar riffs, aggressive drum beats, and powerful vocals that give the album an intense and captivating energy. The opening track 'Militia' sets the tone straight away with its hard-hitting guitar and drum-driven intro that demands your attention, while the slower and more mellow 'Capitol Hill' showcases the versatility of the band members, who prove that they can deliver a more emotional and introspective sound.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is 'Lancer', which features a catchy chorus and an infectious guitar riff that makes you want to get up and dance. This track is a great example of how Cities is able to take classic rock influences and make them sound fresh and modern. I also really enjoyed the closing track, 'Hospital', which is a beautiful and moving ballad that showcases the band's emotional depth and technical ability.

Overall, Cities is an impressive offering by the band, showcasing their immense talent, emotional depth, and range. Despite its low rating, I feel that this album is absolutely worth giving a chance to, especially if you're a fan of classic rock and modern indie rock. The band's history and personal struggles add an extra layer of depth to the album, making it feel like not just a collection of songs but a reflection of the band's journey. In my opinion, Cities is a band to keep an eye on, and I'm excited to see what they come up with next.","1. Review A has a more critical tone while Review B is more positive and descriptive.

The Lemonheads,It's a Shame About Ray [Collector's Edition],Rock,8.4,March 28 2008,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"I couldn't have given a shit about the Lemonheads in 1992, when I was a freshman in college and all the upperclass women were swooning over Evan Dando. For me, his pin-up status de-authenticated his music, which seemed mopey and unsubstantial. He sounded detached, like a stoner at a funeral, and the songs on the Lemonheads' break-out album, It's a Shame About Ray, were so short (several under two minutes) and the hooks so nonchalant they sounded accidental, all of which suggested a paucity of ideas and a short attention span reinforced by song titles like ""Rudderless"" and ""My Drug Buddy"". So, when Rhino's new reissue arrived in the mail a few weeks ago, I put it in my early 90s boombox out of pure nostalgia, mildly curious to hear how or if it had aged. Since then, I've kept playing it for very different reasons, which are more difficult to pinpoint and hopefully say as much about the music as they do about me. Almost 16 years after its initial release, Dando's slacker pop sounds almost Zen. Those short songs now seem concise and even disciplined. What was once mopey now plays as something much more complex and contradictory: exuberant pop melancholy. Some background: The Lemonheads formed in Boston during the mid-1980s and released three albums of fuzzy punk-pop on local label Taang! Records before signing to Atlantic in 1989. Their 1990 major-label debut, Lovey, wasn't a huge return on the investment, but in the two-year interval between that album and Ray, Nirvana and the ensuing alternative boom proved that smaller bands and unlikely signings could have enormous commercial prospects. The Lemonheads both benefited and suffered from this new pop cultural climate: Just as Ray found a more open-minded audience, it was also disregarded by so many kids like me, who were suddenly very serious about music, man, and saw only Dando's model looks, not his songcraft. Never mind that Ray is as much a junkie album as Nevermind, written and partly recorded during a particularly narcotic-heavy trip to Australia. No wonder Dando was a pin-up: He was handsome but damaged, a fixer-upper. If he was the Jordan Catalano before Jared Leto, then the do-they-or-don't-they controversy between him and roommate/bassist/kissing partner/self-professed virgin Juliana Hatfield made them the Ross and Rachel of the ""120 Minutes"" set. Now that all of that hubbub has died down and Dando is just another alt-act trying to make a comeback, Ray sounds nearly revelatory in its restlessness, mixing college pop with country flair and relocating Gus Van Sant's Portland atmosphere to New England. The most beguiling aspect of the title track, one of Dando's best compositions, is its impenetrability: It could be about anyone or pertain to almost any bad situation, and that ambiguity suggests some tragedy that can't be named or faced. ""The Turnpike Down"" descends on a tripping hook that sounds altogether too bubbly for the material, while ""Alison's Starting to Happen"", inspired by a friend's ecstasy trip, sounds genuinely excited, especially when Dando starts rushing his words towards the end. ""Kitchen"", with its handclaps and effervescent jangle, rubs elbows with the tense chords and casually manic repetitions of ""Rudderless"", where the acoustic guitar sounds spikier than the electric. And the bow on the package is the not-necessarily-ironic cover of ""Frank Mills"", a song from the musical Hair that Dando sings with a charmingly goofy bliss. This is, of course, a reissue of a reissue: Less than a year after its initial release, Ray was re-released with that cover of ""Mrs. Robinson"" as a bonus track. It was more of a marketing than a musical decision, some suit's confounding idea to commemorate the 25th anniversary of The Graduate. So, take a red fine-point Sharpie and write ""(bonus track)"" next to that song title, and pretend it's a curious rarity rather than the lame album closer it became. The song is more endearing as a lead-in to Rhino's unearthed bonus tracks, which sound like they've still got dust on them. Aside from the B-side ""Shaky Ground"", which doesn't need the full-band treatment to convey its slept-on melody, there are nine rough demo versions featuring mainly Dando accompanying himself on guitar. That's three-quarters of the album, which isn't bad. There's also a DVD of videos and live performances from the Lemonheads' Australian tour, showcasing the circle of friends who inspired the album as well as a dated title-track clip starring Johnny Depp. But the real attraction here is that set of demos: Dando's songs stand up exceptionally well stripped to their barest essentials, especially ""My Drug Buddy"" and ""Bit Part"", which loses Peggy Noonan's shouted intro but features tender backing vocals from Hatfield. Ultimately, these demos prove how much craft and care went into the album's unique blend of levity and gravity, which sounds so unaffected it could easily be missed.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11324-its-a-shame-about-ray-collectors-edition/,"Atlantic,Rhino,Atlantic,Rhino",1992.0,"The Lemonheads' ""It's a Shame About Ray"" was already a classic record, but the collector's edition adds even more value to this already timeless album. As a long-time fan of the band, I was thrilled to dive into the extra content to get a deeper understanding of the band's history and creative process.

For those who may not be familiar with The Lemonheads, the band has had a long and tumultuous history, and ""It's a Shame About Ray"" marked a pivotal point in their career. Lead singer and songwriter Evan Dando had already established himself as a prolific musician with several critically acclaimed albums under his belt, but this 1992 release was a breakthrough in terms of commercial success.

The album's creation story is fascinating, as the original recording sessions were fraught with tension and disagreements between the band members. However, the final product is a cohesive and nuanced work that showcases the band's versatility and musicianship.

As for the music itself, ""It's a Shame About Ray"" blends elements of punk, folk, and alternative rock to create a unique and diverse sound. From the upbeat and catchy title track to the haunting and melancholic ""My Drug Buddy,"" the album takes listeners on a journey through a range of emotions and experiences.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Rudderless,"" which features a soaring guitar melody that perfectly complements Dando's wistful vocals. The lyrics are introspective and poignant, as Dando sings about feeling lost and adrift in a confusing world.

Overall, I would highly recommend the collector's edition of ""It's a Shame About Ray"" to both die-hard fans and newcomers to The Lemonheads' music. The bonus content provides invaluable insight into the band's creative process, while the album itself remains a masterpiece of alternative rock. With its catchy melodies, thoughtful lyrics, and emotional depth, this album truly deserves its place in the pantheon of rock music classics.","1.

Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings,Give the People What They Want,Pop/R&B,7.7,January 15 2014,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"If you wanted to pick two stories that defined the kind of year Sharon Jones had in 2013, it's easy to single out the first: the pancreatic cancer that struck the singer in the initial run-up to her new album. It's an ailment that grounded one of the most vibrant stage presences in R&B, and it seemed like a cruel rebuttal to a career built on long-due good fortune and a spirit that took on and beat all comers. That she intends to tour again soon after her recent final chemo treatment is a good omen, and with luck the disease will be just a footnote to a long career. The other story of note is the cameo Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings had in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street: there they are, the singer and her group, standing onstage in the role of a wedding band playing James Bond supervillain torch song “Goldfinger” at the reception of a Caligula-minded stockbroker. A movie where a 21st century band plays 1960s music in a scene set in the early 90s—that's the context they found themselves in, and there are few better ways to show off just how unindebted to time they are. Placing Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings at a certain space in time seems easy aesthetically; few bands' version of 1968 have lasted as long or as effectively as theirs. With a virtuoso versatility that all parties involved have cultivated, it wouldn't be a huge shock—much less a disappointment—if they deigned to cross that Nixon-era threshold and fool around with some “Blow Your Head”/“Funky Worm” synthesizers or put a little B.T. Express-style proto-disco hustle in their backbone. But even if the title of Give the People What They Want invokes one of the more state-of-the-art slices of 70s soul as delivered by the O'Jays, Jones and company stay in their more vintage lane. They might be a bit tighter than they were on 2002's Dap-Dippin'..., and they cut a bit more cleanly through their old-school analogue recording methods, but this is an album built less on advancement than resilience. And this is an album with plenty of the latter. It isn't a sound anyone should take for granted, since it's been well-established that the blue-flame intensity of Jones' voice and the Dap-Kings' evocative arrangements aren't exactly common stock and would legitimately bring down the house anywhere from Coachella to Wattstax. Both singer and band have gotten so versed in their mixture of classic Southern soul and occasional flourishes of Motown or Philly soul opulence—transitions they make with a masterful smoothness—that even a first listen will make a song feel lived-in, with an “always been there” familiarity that hasn't yet gone threadbare. Even the cover art is a direct nod of a throwback—a more ornate riff on the sleeve of the Chi-Lites' 1971 LP (For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People. That lets slip another commonality of theirs with vintage R&B—the idea of soul as a vehicle for social commentary. The fun irony of Jones and the Dap-Kings playing the on-screen Jordan Belfort's wedding is that their songs' sense of grievance, justice, and populist power has rarely felt stronger. Opener “Retreat!”, with its martial-march tweak of the Holland-Dozier-Holland that gave us “I Hear a Symphony”, is a massive kiss-off to some arrogant somebody-or-other that can't help but crumble in the face of “a woman scorned”—though any lingering spite is drowned out by the sheer joy of Jones expressing the strength needed to overcome someone else's misdeeds. “People Don't Get What They Deserve” is that rare dose of idealism-deflating reality that doesn't drown in its own bitter cynicism; Jones' sprint-paced rapport with the backup singer Dapettes doesn't sound jaded and world-weary enough, and right on to that. And “We Get Along” holds the prescription to endure—help and relief might be a long time coming, but being able to keep on doing it in the face of strife is a source of inner strength in the meantime. It's implicit gospel that puts its faith in the people. Give the People What They Want is a pretty short 10 songs, though its breezy half-hour leaves plenty that sticks and plenty more worth revisiting when it doesn't. The collection's balance of rousing barn-burners and slower, sweeter break-up/make-up ballads (like the sun-streaked bliss of “Slow Down, Love”) keeps it moving. And it's all briskly impassioned enough to make most skeptics brush off the old “have I heard this before?” questions, even if this is one of the more get-what-you-expect albums of the early year. It's like peeking into an alternate reality where an artist like Lyn Collins or Marva Whitney could have a decade-plus career without having to worry about changes in trends—and it's long since been clear by now that Jones belongs in their class. May she remain unstoppable.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18835-sharon-jones-and-the-dap-kings-give-the-people-what-they-want/,Daptone,2013.0,"Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings have made a name for themselves as one of the most impressive R&B acts in recent memory, and their album ""Give the People What They Want"" only further cements their status as one of the best in the game. This album is a perfect fusion of pop and R&B, with catchy hooks, groovy instrumentals, and powerful vocals from Sharon Jones herself.

The band has a rich history, having formed in the early 2000s in Brooklyn. They were heavily influenced by classic soul and funk acts from the 60s and 70s, and their sound reflects this. Their early work caught the attention of Amy Winehouse, who asked them to back her on her album ""Back to Black"". Since then, they've released several critically acclaimed albums, with ""Give the People What They Want"" being one of their crowning achievements.

The creation story of this album is an interesting one. The band actually started recording it in 2012, but then Sharon Jones was diagnosed with cancer. She took time off to undergo treatment, but tragically, she passed away in 2016. The band then resumed recording the album as a tribute to her, and released it later that year. This gives the album an added layer of poignancy, and you can feel the passion and dedication that the band poured into it.

Personally, I find this album to be an absolute joy to listen to. Every song is so well-crafted, with catchy hooks and intricate instrumentation that rewards multiple listens. ""Retreat!"" is a standout track, with a driving beat and catchy refrain that I can't get out of my head. ""Making Up and Breaking Up"" is another highlight, with a funky bassline and Sharon Jones' powerful vocals.

The album isn't perfect, though. Some of the tracks can blend together a bit, and at times the production feels a bit overbearing. However, these are minor quibbles in the grand scheme of things.

Overall, I'd give ""Give the People What They Want"" a solid 7.7 out of 10. It's a great showcase for Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings' talents, and it's an album that's sure to put a smile on your face. Give it a listen, you won't regret it.","1.

Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks,Mirror Traffic,Rock,7.7,August 22 2011,Rob Mitchum,Contributor,"As we spend the next nine years critically dissecting and reassessing the 1990s, let's agree to make one historical revision: The lo-fi auteurs of the era-- your Malkmuses, your Pollards, your Elephant Sixers-- were not in fact ""slackers,"" despite the prevailing label/insult of the the day. Truthfully, their lack of studio polish was not a matter of laziness, ironic aesthetic, or poverty, but a coping mechanism for the unstoppable torrent of melodies, words, and ideas exploding from each songwriter's brain. No time for getting that song exactly right-- on to the next one. That first-draft immediacy can fade with success, creative fatigue, or that demon ""maturity."" In the case of Malkmus, the transformation took the flavor of just wanting to play his damn guitar-- a mid-life crisis where sports cars were replaced with extended solos, ornate riffs, and long songs that felt even longer. But if the recent rash of alt-rock reunions were meant to cash in on audience nostalgia, perhaps some happy memories ricocheted back onto the bandleaders as they revisited their ragged, spontaneous greatest hits. To put it plainly, Mirror Traffic is not the time travel back to Pavement's peak that is the futile wish of every 30-something indie dork, but it is a rewind to a less perfectionist Malkmus, packed with the most mischief and weirdness he's displayed since his eponymous solo debut. It also has the most songs since Wowee Zowee. Like that declaration of independence from the confines of a successful band, Mirror Traffic possesses a relaxed, spontaneous feel befitting his earlier days in NoCal. Despite originally wanting to title the album L.A. Guns and putting the hard-rocking ""Senator"" forward as the first single, Malkmus largely lays off the Guitar Hero: The fretboard theatrics are used more sparingly and deployed to much greater effect on ""Forever 28"" where a ""Mr. Blue Sky"" bounce is interrupted by Thin Lizzy runs, or in the thrilling summertime riff of ""Stick Figures in Love"". Only three songs break the five-minute barrier, and these feel far less claustrophobic than the extended tracks on the last three Jicks records. ""Share the Red""'s shambolic waltz, for instance, goes down easier than the 10-minute-long interlocking duets of ""Real Emotional Trash"". Songs also move in unexpected directions, like the Go! Team-ish coda of ""No One Is (As I Are Be)"" or the slingshot tempo changes of ""Spazz"". Even a brief interstitial like ""Jumblegloss""-- with cosmic guitars and unidentifiable auditory objects whirring by-- is a refreshing bit of spontaneity to rinse after the album's most Jicks-like rocker, ""Brain Gallop"". The less serious vibe better suits Malkmus' still intact sense of humor and menagerie of oddballs (opening here with a nudist in Birkenstocks and ending 15 songs later with a cousin ""down with soft rap""). Happily, celebrity producer Beck doesn't employ the heavy hand he showed earlier this year on Thurston Moore's Demolished Thoughts, which re-enacted Sea Change with the Sonic Youth frontman on vocals. Here, Beck's fingerprints are lighter-- he plays enabler to Malkmus' quirks, leaving in mid-vocal laughs, adding subtle lap-steel on ""Tigers"" and ""Long Hard Book"", and fuzzing out the punkish ""Spazz"" and ""Tune Grief"". Whether he likes it or not, Malkmus is the indie-rock version of a Dylan or Simon or U2, artists who will forever be blurbed as making ""their best album since ____."" Competing with his younger self is definitely not a priority for Malkmus, who went through Pavement's reunion tour like he was punching a clock. Any resemblance to earlier days is likely unintentional, but for the aging hipsters of the world, even an accidental flashback is a good contact high. Mirror Traffic tickles that nostalgia without sacrificing maturity, discovering that ""playfully relaxed"" is a valid third route between ""slacker"" and ""manic.""",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15736-mirror-traffic/,"Matador,Domino",2011.0,"Stephen Malkmus is a legend in the rock music world, and with his band The Jicks, he has created some of the most iconic rock music of our time. The latest album from this talented musician is the fabulous 'Mirror Traffic', which delivers a solid performance that showcases why Malkmus and his band are still masters of the genre.

For those who may not know, Stephen Malkmus was the lead singer and guitarist of the seminal indie rock group, Pavement. After the band disbanded in 1999, Malkmus began releasing albums with his new band, The Jicks, who have become known for their unique sound that mixes classic rock, folk, and indie rock in a beautiful blend.

'Mirror Traffic' marks the fifth album release from Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, and it is a beautifully crafted piece of work that showcases the band's strengths. Malkmus is always pushing the boundaries of rock music, and this album is no exception. It is a fresh take on the genre that delivers a combination of intricate musical arrangements, beautiful vocal work, and intelligent lyrics.

The album's creation story is a truly interesting one. Malkmus brought in outside producers to help them with the production process, including Beck, who co-produced several tracks, and long-time collaborator Mike Clark. The collaboration of these talented musicians and producers allowed for a true blending of styles and sounds, resulting in a cohesive album that captures Malkmus and his band's vision.

The album features many standout tracks, including the opening track 'Tigers', which sets the tone for the entire album with its catchy hooks and clever lyrics. Other notable tracks include 'No One Is (As I Are Be)', which features Malkmus' signature intricate guitar work, 'Stick Figures in Love', where Malkmus shows that he is still a master of creating beautiful melodies, and 'Gorgeous Georgie', which is a beautiful ballad that showcases the singer's vocal range.

Personal opinions? I have to say that 'Mirror Traffic' is an amazing album, and one that I would definitely recommend to any fan of rock music. The album's unique sound and intelligent lyrics make it stand out from the crowd, and it is clear that Malkmus and his band put a lot of thought and effort into creating a cohesive piece of work.

Overall, 'Mirror Traffic' is a must-listen for anyone who appreciates great rock music. Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks are true masters of the genre, and this album is a testament to that fact.

Various Artists,Habibi Funk: An Eclectic Selection of Music From the Arab World,,7.6,December 11 2017,Andy Beta,Contributor,"In an interview with The Believer, Sublime Frequencies founder Alan Bishop described a vast difference between Western and other cultures. “There’s a thing about ‘new is everything,’ old is unwanted,” he said, going on to add that while he fetishized these cultures’ old music, he realized that in locales like Thailand, Morocco, or Syria, “the culture is left to rot, just like the buildings and the infrastructure. No money is going back into preserving things.” Perhaps as a bulwark against such rot, the Habibi Funk imprint was set up two years ago to shine a light on older music from the Arab world and founder Jannis Stuertz is aware of that dichotomy. “Too often re-releases of old music are mainly being consumed exclusively by a western audience,” he writes in the liner notes that accompany his label’s latest compilation, though he notes that in traveling through the Middle East, he now counters young fans who “got attached to music of their parents’ generations and that they are now themselves…looking for records.” Reissues of late often scrounge neglected parts of the world for western pulses, be it Surinam, the French West Indies, or Hawaii. And across its first six releases, Habibi Funk generally does appeal to what sounds good to western ears, usually of the funk variety, with traces of soul, R&B, rock and smooth disco for good measure. But in our current climate where Islam and Arab culture remains grossly distorted and willfully misunderstood, there’s a sense of urgency that—beyond the music—the label is also offering a Western audience a chance to better understand this region by moving to it. It’s fitting that the set kicks off with “Bsslama Hbibti,” a hard-sweating stomp from Fadoul, a Moroccan whose closest parallel might be to James Brown. From the artist who helped put them on the radar, “Hbiti” features gritty drums, lashing guitar, and Fadoul’s near-manic pleas atop it all. But whereas Brown and band would be dapper and disciplined, there’s something unhinged in the energy of the performance that brings to mind the raucous takes on R&B that Rob Tyner and the MC5 dipped into. Its companion is Bob Destiny’s “Wang Dang,” which—although recorded and released in Algeria—is shouted by an African-American from New Orleans who spent time in the region as a choreographer. Similarly curious is how the melody for “Für Elise” crosses borders to Morocco to become the guitar line for the shouts of a raucous unknown track from Attarazat Addahabia. Fans of Sublime Frequencies and their exhaustive look at Southeast Asian bands taken by surf music will find kinship in “Mirza” and the skronking sax lines of Sudanese track “El Bomba.” And just when it seems the comp is firmly entrenched in an exploration of how ’60s rock and R&B infiltrated the region, the tumbling disco beat and needling reeds make Mallek Mohamed’s “Rouhi Ya Hafida” refreshing. (The liner notes also hint that the Algerian musician also recorded but never released experimental electronic music as well.) “Sah,” from Egyptian artist Al Massrieen, also rides a slick dance beat, the female backing vocals and slide guitar sending it towards the cosmic end of the disco spectrum. But sometimes the sleeker funk doesn’t quite work on some of the tracks, as on the too busy rubber bass of “Lala Tibki” and lo-fi “Games.” The most arresting track is “Ayonha,” featuring buoyant drum machines, jangly guitars and tickly synths, all played by Libyan-born Hamid El Shaeri. El Shaeri found pop stardom in Egypt from the ’80s well into the ’00s and the track’s airy harmonies and easy feel wouldn’t sound out of place on AM radio in California. Similarly, sweet vocal harmonies drift across Tunisian band Dalton, who embrace the likes of Tim Maia and the Doobie Brothers on the laidback “Soul Brother.” Sounding at once American and Brazilian, the Tunisians suggest—if sadly not a real-world actuality—a musical brotherhood that transcends such boundaries.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-habibi-funk-an-eclectic-selection-of-music-from-the-arab-world/,Habibi Funk Records,2017.0,"If you're a fan of eclectic and soulful music, then Habibi Funk: An Eclectic Selection of Music From the Arab World will be music to your ears. The album features various artists hailing from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Arab world, and the result is an enchanting and diverse compilation that celebrates the region's rich cultural heritage.

The album's concept is the brainchild of German DJ Jannis Stürtz, founder of Habibi Funk Records. Sturtz noticed a gap in the music market for Middle Eastern music that wasn't belly dance or pop-oriented, and thus began digging through dusty record stores and private collections. His goal was to find hidden gems that had been overlooked or ignored.

The result is ""Habibi Funk: An Eclectic Selection of Music From the Arab World"", a 15-track album that showcases a wide range of sonic styles, including funk, soul, jazz, and even rock. The album is not just a showcase of different artists from the region, but also of the creativity and innovation that permeates the respective music scenes from which they hail.

One standout track on the album is ""Youm el-dah"" by Magdy El Husseiny. This groovy track effortlessly blends classic Egyptian music with contemporary soul, creating something truly unique and vibrant. Another standout track is ""Al Bareedo Ana"" by Abdel Karim Al Shaar. The track is a lovely execution of the simplicity of Arabic music but with the power of shaabi rhythms that enhance the mood.

Listening to Habibi Funk is an eye-opening experience. This is music that is reflective of the complexities and richness of Middle Eastern culture. As a non-Arab listener, I found myself immersed in the music and drawn into the individual stories of each track. One can truly sense the artists' individual personal touch through the music, with each offering their own unique perspective through their sound.

Overall, Habibi Funk: An Eclectic Selection of Music From the Arab World, is a must-listen for anyone who appreciates music that honors our differences and illuminates our shared human experience. With a rating of 7.6 out of 10, it's clear that the album has received critical acclaim and it rightfully deserves so. You definitely want to add this album to your playlist if you haven't already, and get lost in the sounds of the Middle East.","1.

RAMZi,Pèze-Piton,Electronic,7.7,January 29 2018,Andy Beta,Contributor,"“My music is a big mash of fusions and re-imaginings,” Phoebé Guillemot recently said about the music she makes as RAMZi. That mash is as slippery as anything currently being made in electronic music. Across a series of cassette releases and 12”s, Guillemot has presented sounds from around the world as though mapped onto a wad of Silly Putty. On the nine-track Pèze-Piton, RAMZi makes the most club-friendly iteration of her music yet, signaling a pivot away from its gooier aspects. Nose flutes, kuduro rhythms, bits of bandoneon, and dubby bass tones all bob to the surface of “MWI Intro” before a sturdier beat overtakes “Backin.” RAMZi has said that she gravitates to kwaito’s 100-bpm rhythms, and “Safe” hovers in that range before a heavier drum pattern drops. Brief bits of German and Portuguese can be discerned, another hallmark of her work. Beyond a surface similarity to Kanye’s sped-up soul productions of the early 2000s, the mix of slowed-down, molasses-like voices and high-pitched chirruping brings to mind the giddy sensation of traveling in another country and sitting down at a café, where conversations swirl around you, none of them quite making sense. That sense of peregrination with no exact destination in mind speaks to our present moment in music consumption, in which listening takes the form of skipping from tracks on SoundCloud to YouTube videos suggested by friends to whatever tickles us in the moment.  It’s an overwhelming array (and amount) of music for any listener and music producer to digest, which seems in part how RAMZi herself approaches it. Nigerian hip-hop, the bewildering modern batida of labels like Príncipe Discos, the spongy dancehall of Equiknoxx, Brazilian baile funk,  Ugandan electronic music—all come to mind when listening to her productions, mixed in a way that can feel dizzying. The title of “Brazili” might evoke the South American country, but RAMZi refuses to make such an easy comparison; the bustling percussion and echoing whoops that make for the album’s most satisfying track could really be from anywhere. “Fly Timoun” is the longest track, and also the one with a hand-drum pattern that makes you drunk in trying to move with it as cowbells and organ slosh around the song’s perimeter. Midway through, RAMZi wanders away from the beat, and the club walls give way to bird calls, dense foliage, and the butteriest pronunciation of the word “chocolate” possible. Rather than stay on the grid like so many electronic producers, RAMZi knows that getting lost in a new place is one of traveling's biggest thrills.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ramzi-peze-piton/,12th Isle,2017.0,"When it comes to music that invites you to lose yourself and let the beat take over, not many artists can create the kind of sonic world that RAMZi does. The latest album from this elusive electronic musician, Pèze-Piton, is a mesmerizing aural journey that immerses you in a hallucinatory landscape of rhythms and textures that are both otherworldly and deeply familiar.

For those unfamiliar with RAMZi, a little bit of context is in order. Born and raised in Montreal, Canada, she has been releasing music under this moniker for the past decade, attracting a devoted following for her boundary-pushing soundscapes that blend elements of techno, house, dub and more. Despite her popularity, RAMZi is an artist who shies away from the spotlight and rarely gives interviews, letting her music speak for itself.

With Pèze-Piton, RAMZi takes us on a sonic excursion to the tropical island of La Réunion, located in the Indian Ocean. Inspired by field recordings and the island's creole culture, the album is a homage to the rich musical traditions of this unique place. RAMZi's approach to sampling and production is one of blending and morphing, creating an aural environment that's both familiar and yet uncharted. The lush soundscapes, interwoven rhythms, and dreamy textures give a sense of being in a constantly shifting, kaleidoscopic world.

The album has a great flow, always keeping you guessing where it's going next. The tracks blend seamlessly together, sometimes barely distinguishable, and sometimes jumping to a completely different register altogether. Opening with the delicate textures of ""Présence Féminine,"" the listener is gently introduced to the sounds ahead. But soon, the percussion-heavy ""Couer-cœur à l'Ouvrage"" takes over, its skittering beats and bursts of sound building to a hypnotic climax.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""La Nuit Rouge,"" which features an infectious bass groove that will get your body moving. RAMZi loops and chops the vocals into a heady mantra, immersing you in a trance-like state. It's easy to imagine being transported to a sweaty dance floor, lost in the rhythm of this track.

Another highlight is ""Cocon,"" a more downtempo track that allows you to catch your breath after the frenzied rhythms of previous tracks. Its gentle melody and lo-fi beats create a feeling of relaxation and introspection, a perfect breather amidst the high energy of the album.

Overall, Pèze-Piton is a textured, carefully crafted album that showcases RAMZi's unique approach to electronic music. For fans of experimental beats and dreamlike atmospheres, this is a must-listen. The album's perfect balancing of frenzied energy and meditative calmness has a deep impact on the listener, taking you on a journey to a world you never knew existed. RAMZi continues to prove herself as one of electronic music's most promising and exciting voices, and Pèze-Piton only cements her status as a true artist to follow.","1.

The Bitters,East General,"Electronic,Rock",5.6,May 7 2010,Joe Colly,Contributor,"It's hard to imagine why, but the Bitters decided this image above was the best cover for their debut album. Yikes. It's a foul, repulsive picture (fun fact: it was also used by Norwegian black metal band Orcustus), but in a way, it kind of makes sense. Because the Bitters do in fact make gross-sounding music. Not cringe-inducing music, or grotesque music, but their sound is primarily about scuzz-- in their formula, garage-rock, art-punk, and even sunny pop are covered in a thick, goopy layer of mud. This is an increasingly common approach, used by bands like Vivian Girls, Golden Triangle, and Sic Alps, but usually these acts balance out their murk with pop hooks. But the Bitters, who are vocalist Aerin Fogel and Ben Cook (Fucked Up, Young Governor), skew more to the noise side of the equation. Their ramshackle songs mostly resist pop arrangements-- it's more about capturing a feeling within a racket than finding grooves or melody. Guitars screech, drums thud, Fogel shrieks, but amidst this noise there's a sense of forward momentum (albeit a wild, out-of-control kind) that keeps their songs grounded in some form of structure. On East General, the Bitters marry cacophony with bits of doo-wop and grungy rock, but the album can be a slog for a couple reasons. First, the balance is off-- there's just not enough tunefulness to compensate for all the clamor. The band does offer some sweet moments-- the girl-group harmonizing of ""No Anchor"" and ""Impatient as Can Be""-- but mostly they emphasize harshness so much that songs become muddy and unmemorable. The record's other main issue is length. Bands who do this kind of thing well (No Age or Sic Alps) know brevity is key, and these tracks would work better shorter. There's no reason, for example, that closer ""I'm Feeling Good"" needs to approach seven minutes-- there aren't enough ideas to carry it that long. Not surprisingly then, East General works best on straightforward, punchier songs like ""Nails in the Coffin"" and ""The New Real Way"". If you've followed the Bitters on their early singles, you know they can crank out good material when they keep things simple-- see blog fave ""Warrior"". A lover's anthem equal parts venom and longing, it was brief and to the point and highlighted both Cook's untamed instrumentation and Fogel's captivating vocals. It seems reasonable to think they could find that spark again and shake off this record with a stronger follow-up.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14210-east-general/,Mexican Summer,2010.0,"If you're a fan of both Electronic and Rock music genres, then The Bitters' album, ""East General"" is worth listening to. With a rating of 5.6 out of 10, it's definitely not a perfect album, but it has its moments.

Before we dive into the music, let's talk about The Bitters. The band formed in the early 2000s and gained some popularity in the underground music scene. They were known for their blend of Electronic music and Rock, often incorporating synths and electronic beats into their guitar-driven sound. ""East General"" is their third album and was released just last year.

The band's evolution is evident in this album, as they have moved towards a more polished sound while still maintaining their signature blend of genres. The album was created over the course of a year, with the band members experimenting with various instrumentations and sounds while recording in their home studio.

Now let's get into the music. The album opens with ""Brokenhearted City,"" a track that immediately sets the tone for the rest of the album. The electronic beat and guitar riffs work in tandem to create a sense of urgency and angst that carries throughout the album. ""East General"" has a lot of upbeat and catchy tracks like ""Rooftop Romance"" and ""Electric Heart,"" both of which showcase the band's talent for creating infectious hooks.

While the album has its moments of brilliance, it also has some tracks that fall flat. ""Shimmering Lights"" and ""Broken Promises"" both suffer from a lack of originality and seem like filler tracks in an otherwise cohesive album.

Overall, ""East General"" is a good effort from The Bitters. The electronic elements add a new layer to their sound, while the guitar work and vocals are still top-notch. While not every track is a standout, there are definitely some gems to be found on this album. If you're a fan of Electronic and Rock music, give ""East General"" a spin and see what you think.

Dalhous,Visibility Is a Trap,,7.4,April 7 2014,Miles Raymer,Contributor,"It wouldn’t be technically inaccurate to call Dalhous’s new EP Visibility Is A Trap an ambient music record—it’s full of lush, slowly shifting sounds. In general, it’s far more concerned with texture than rhythm or tune, so it meets the genre’s main requirements. But the description doesn’t completely fit. By definition an ambient record, even a great one, is supposed to be able to function as aural wallpaper (and be “as ignorable as it is interesting,” according to Brian Eno), but even at its most tranquil moments Visibility refuses to fade into the background. While it has some genuinely blissful passages, it’s mostly just unsettling in a way that’s difficult to pin down—if it was actually wallpaper, you’d swear you could catch its patterns shifting in your peripheral vision. “Unsettling” has been the duo’s default mode ever since releasing the 2012 EP Mitchell Heisman, named after a man who committed suicide in 2010 and left behind a 1,900 page exposition on the nature of human existence as way of a suicide note. Visibility is a subtler work, from its titular reference—a line from Michel Foucault’s Discipline and Punish in a passage regarding Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon, a prison where inmates are never out of their supervisors’ view—on down. The Foucault reference establishes a paranoid dread that Alex Ander and Marc Dall spend four songs probing and building on with a palette of druggy synth pads and woozy sub-bass deep enough that it might actually be capable of messing with your inner ear. (There’s also a remix by Regis of “He Was Human And Belonged With Humans"", from last year’s An Ambassador For Laing LP.) Ander and Dall are so good at setting an ominous mood that when they shatter the tension on track three, “Sight of Hirta"", by dropping in the EP’s only real beat—a stuttering, stroboscopic thing that slides around a straight dance rhythm but never sticks—almost a traumatic experience. Visibility is supposed to be inspired by Dall’s interest in the self-help and anti-psychiatry movement, particularly in the Scottish psychiatrist R.D. Laing, whose views on the nature of mental illness—and his insistence that the emotional and mental experiences of the mentally ill shouldn’t be treated simply as pathologies—made him an outcast in his profession but a hero to anti-psychiatry activists. Laing, anti-psychiatry, and self-help all figured into the '70s New Age movement, and, with its plentiful pads and lack of drums, Visibility often evokes New Age music, as well as a general macrame-encrusted hippie-dippy vibe—The burbly synths on “Active Discovering” sound like they could have been pulled from an especially out-there block of programming on PBS during my childhood in the Me Decade’s afterglow. But Dall and Ander like to subvert that feeling as soon as they establish it, and by its halfway point the song’s dissonant elements have accumulated into a sinister edge. Like David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick, Ander and Dall are happy to present their audience with a bunch of ambiguities that they leave hanging in the air at the end. Their refusal to let the record resolve itself into something that can be easily sorted or explained makes it easy to play it on repeat, trying to find a new angle to approach it from.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19149-dalhous-visibility-is-a-trap/,Blackest Ever Black,2014.0,"Dalhous’ latest album, ""Visibility Is a Trap,"" is a fascinating exploration of the boundaries between reality and perception. Delving deep into the realms of experimental music, the Glasgow-based band has weaved a unique tapestry of soundscapes, beats and melodies that is both eerie and mesmerizing.

Before we dive into the album itself, let me take a moment to introduce you to Dalhous. The band is the brainchild of Marc Dall, a musician and producer who has been experimenting with electronic music for more than a decade. In 2012, he teamed up with Alex Ander, an artist and musician based in New York, to form Dalhous. Together, they have released four critically acclaimed albums, each one pushing the boundaries of electronic music in new and exciting ways.

""Visibility Is a Trap"" is the band’s latest offering, and it’s clear that they have continued to push their creative limits. The album is inspired by French philosopher Jean Baudrillard’s ""Simulacra and Simulation,"" which explores the concept of hyperreality – a state in which the line between reality and fiction becomes blurred. This is reflected in the album’s title, which alludes to the idea that the more we try to be seen, the more we become trapped in illusions.

From the opening track, ""End Of Each Analysis,"" it's obvious that this is not an album for the faint-hearted. It's a challenging listening experience that encompasses various textures, moods, and tempos. The album is brimming with inventive sonic patterns and rhythmic beats that make it truly unique.

One of the highlights of the album is the track ""Function Curve."" With its driving beats and futuristic synths, it draws the listener deeper into its hypnotic trance. Another standout track is ""Ecstasy As A Mask Or A Shield,"" which features a haunting melody that rises and falls in intensity, creating a sense of suspense and unease.

Throughout the album, Dalhous experiment with various techniques and sounds. They blend together ambient, techno and industrial sounds to create a sonic landscape that is both diverse and cohesive. The production is excellent, and each track is carefully crafted to build on the previous one, like chapters in a gripping novel.

""Visibility Is a Trap"" is not an album for everyone. It demands an open mind and a willingness to step outside one’s musical comfort zone. But for those who are up for the challenge, it's an incredibly rewarding experience. It's an album that invites you to take a journey within yourself, to explore the boundaries of your perception, and to question the illusions that surround us in our daily lives.

In conclusion, ""Visibility Is a Trap"" is a daring and thought-provoking album that showcases Dalhous’ ability to push the boundaries of electronic music. It's a must-listen for anyone who is looking for something new, something that challenges their perceptions, and something that is just downright cool. So put your headphones on, close your eyes, and let yourself be swept away by the mind-bending sounds of Dalhous.","1.

Dirty Projectors,The Glad Fact,Rock,8.5,January 5 2004,William Bowers,Contributor,"Things you should know about Dave ""D-Lo"" Longstreth, the singer, visual artist, and multi-instrumentalist behind The Dirty Projectors: The Yale dropout is (why pull punches?) a nobrow genius, who claims to find similar solaces in the work of Beethoven, Wagner, Zeppelin and Timberlake. He is obsessed with rendering into song an image that congeals the iconography of Poe, Hitchcock, and McDonalds. That image: a young man defending himself from an army of finches by pelting them with french fries. This daymare haunts Longstreth's (for freak-out fans only) Morning Better Last EP and his current album The Glad Fact, as well as his forthcoming ""double EP"", Slaves' Graves and Ballads (half of which will feature his ten-piece Orchestral Society for the Preservation of the Orchestra), and his upcoming ""glitch opera,"" The Getty Address. His (often multi-tracked) vocals are (often wonderfully) way over the top: he belts like a conspicuous olden minstrel who'd be murdered by his knights, croons like a homeless, yankee Morrissey, warbles like an acid-bent Jim James, panics like a bansheefied M. Ward, and even occasionally barks like a castrati Casablancas. These comparisons are cute indie lilypads for us to drink to, but I am still failing to communicate how soothing Longstreth can sound, how raceless, and how sincerely surreal. I could throw more vocal styles at you (Xiu Xiu, Bobby McFerrin, TV on the Radio), but the neighbors and their cops would think we were causing a disturbance. He wrote much of The Glad Fact in lungbursts, accompanying himself with a fist on the roof of his car. One of the album's showpieces, ""My Offwhite Flag"", with its deconstructed Toots & The Maytals versus Need New Body vibe, evokes a Lockheed Martin post-kaboom-scape: to this song the listener can picture a West that has been smithereened into archipelagodom, where the human survivors place their faith in po-mo calypso's power to impress the warlord carnival judges. He doesn't cling to any lo-fi manifesto, telling me in an email Q&A; that championing one aesthetic as somehow offering more texture than another is ""like religion, a way of training your gaze to obscure what's in front of you."" While he promises that his next project will be 5.1, fuzz-and-buzzheads may savor the Robert Pollard chords of ""Naked We Made It"" and the underplayed epic solo of ""Lit from Below"". He has created some bizarrely tuned and timed Connecticut jazz. ""Boredom Is a Product"" plays like Owls being led by a drag Nina Simone; the brilliantly strummed ""Like Fake Blood in Crisp October"" suggests a pre-intermission ballad from Institutionalizing Porgy and Bess. Longstreth coos the Liars-esque line, ""That's not a monument/ It's a grave,"" only to transcend it: ""The new feelings will probably be buried here, too."" Let me clarify my earlier reliance on ""genius."" Longstreth is not necessarily a zeitgeisty and palatable master assimilator (see Bob Dylan). He's another kind of genius, the unhinged, half-formed kind who sometimes overconceives and overexecutes (see Phil Elvrum). D-Lo has, fittingly, toured with several of the experi-mellow bands out of the increasingly mystical K Records compound. Also be warned: if you grew up in the back of a stationwagon, near a ""classic parking lot at the end of time,"" prepare for a life-changingly deadpan and exultant refrain about those days of plastic passion: no one can swoon ""We drank a two-liter of Orange Crush"" the way Dave Longstreth does.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2534-the-glad-fact/,Western Vinyl,2003.0,"The Glad Fact by Dirty Projectors is a work of art with a fascinating backstory. As a long-time fan of the band's unique style, I was already anticipating this release with great excitement. The album is a shining example of the intricate, boundary-pushing Rock that Dirty Projectors is known for, and it delivers a powerful listening experience that is not to be missed.

To understand the album, it is important to know its creator's history. David Longstreth, the brains behind the band, has never been afraid to experiment and push boundaries when it comes to music. He started Dirty Projectors in 2002 with friend and fellow musician Aaron Maine, developing a sound that is all their own. He has previously released several albums that lean into experimental sounds, but it was with The Glad Fact that he truly outdid himself.

The album was created during a time of experimentation for Longstreth. He had locked himself in a secluded studio for months, experimenting with sounds and compositions, determined to create something truly unique. The result is an album that borders on the avant-garde but is still accessible and incredibly enjoyable.

One of the things I appreciate most about The Glad Fact is its ability to keep listeners engaged from start to finish. The album kicks off with ""I Sit on The Ridge at Dusk"", a track that sets the tone for the rest of the album. It's a slow-burning track that gradually builds in intensity and features lush harmonies and imaginative instrumentation. As the album progresses, Longstreth manages to keep the listener on their toes with every track, with each song offering something different and captivating.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Buckle Up"". It's a song that features a plucky, intricate guitar riff and rhythms that feel both odd and inviting. Longstreth's voice is also incredibly impressive here, soaring over the soundscape he has created. ""No More"" is another highlight, with its hypnotic rhythm and haunting melody.

What I appreciate most about The Glad Fact is its sheer creativity. The album offers a new experience with every listen, with unique and intricate sounds revealing themselves even after multiple listens. The attention to detail by Longstreth as both a lyricist and a composer is simply astounding.

Overall, The Glad Fact by Dirty Projectors is an album that is definitely worth checking out. It is an example of a musician at the top of their creative game, unafraid to experiment and take risks. If you're a fan of boundary-pushing Rock with an experimental twist, this album is a must-listen. I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something new and exciting to add to their rotation.","1.

Goatsnake,Black Age Blues,Metal,7.3,June 5 2015,Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,"During their decade-plus long disappearance, the supergroup status of the doom band Goatsnake grew. When the quartet released their last album, 2000’s Flower of Disease, the new project of guitarist Greg Anderson, an amplifier-worship duo he called Sunn O))), had issued its debut LP only months earlier. Scream—the childhood hardcore Virginia crew and talent crucible of Goatsnake singer Pete Stahl—had yet to reunite. And neither had the Obsessed, the atavistic doom squad of drummer Greg Rogers. But in recent years, the rise or reactivation of those respective projects and a wave of young acts exploring a Goatsnake-like mix of Southern rock heroics and distortion-heavy harangues have retroactively elevated the band to a near-mythical position. In the first life, Goatsnake existed for less than five years and issued two good albums; in the afterlife and now the resurrection, they have fostered a legacy much more significant than the original output ever portended. After occasional concerts during the last five years, Goatsnake returned to the studio last summer to stage a proper comeback. The resulting nine-song set, Black Age Blues, affirms their long-standing love of metal force and classic-rock verve without pushing the mix to many new extremes. Though they swapped bassist Scott Reeder for Sourvein player Scott Renner (what are the chances?), Goatsnake staged the album as a literal continuation of Flower of Disease. That LP ended with a song called ""The River"", which closed with an eerie, extended strings-and-sirens dénouement. So this record opens with ""Another River to Cross"", which begins by sampling that old ellipsis before the band slams down with four-piece force. They sound excellent and energized, Anderson’s riff racing through switchbacks beneath Stahl’s arching, almost-gleeful reflections on mortality. The next 40 minutes wind through mid-tempo rumbles and howling harmonica solos, blustery riffs and muscular drum fills, Zeppelin references and ""C.C. Rider"" nods, songs about existential crises and songs about earthly delights. With hazy hooks powered by a mighty band, Black Age Blues is, as advertised, very much the third Goatsnake album. But Black Age Blues is strongest when it suggests that the members and their musical relationships have evolved during Goatsnake’s recess, especially when the past presents new stylistic tension. For his part, Stahl is more confident and convincing as a Southern soul-loving leader. He commands a small background choir—""Dem Preachers’ Daughters,"" they call themselves—throughout the record, sometimes letting them lift his leads and sometimes dueling with their harmonies. He stutters syllables like an unabashed Robert Plant acolyte and stretches his words skywards like a gospel singer bound for glory. These traits thrill when they clash with Anderson’s own development as an ultra-low-and-slow guitarist. ""House of the Moon"", for instance, opens with a rich tone and ominous lurch that suggest Sunn O))). Even as the choir joins Stahl to exclaim things like ""Shine on"" during the chorus, Anderson burrows deeper, his menacing variations providing a sinister foil to the ascendant soul vocals. And near the end of the great ""Coffee & Whiskey"", Anderson and Stahl wrestle on tape. The singer squeals and exhorts like he’s moonlighting with the Faces. The guitarist, meanwhile, strangles a dense theme into submission, refusing to join the joy ride. That disparity was always a key to Goatsnake, but as the interests of its members have grown, such frisson has become as vital to the sound as the songs themselves. Through little fault of Goatsnake’s own, listening to Black Age Blues can sometimes feel like watching wizened blues musicians play the music of their now-distant youth. The style is familiar enough to be comforting, but it’s also inherently trite and redundant. You’ve already heard the permutations that have followed. Since Goatsnake released Flower of Disease, there’s been a renaissance of provocative doom, particularly from bands doubly influenced by psychedelic and Southern rock. It’s impossible not to think about how Weedeater might distort and destroy the chemical surge of ""Coffee & Whiskey"" or to what new lysergic limits Kylesa could push closer ""A Killing Blues"". Goatsnake add some tricks and twists for Black Age Blues, but as if in deference to the supergroup side-project’s nature, they don’t aim to reinvent themselves or their sound. Instead, they simply have fun playing with the past and delivering at least a few new anthems in the process. At least that’s better than plenty of their reunited peers cashing in on the festival circuit even attempt, let alone accomplish.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20598-black-age-blues/,Southern Lord,2015.0,"When it comes to metal with a bluesy edge, few bands are as revered as Goatsnake, and their latest album, ""Black Age Blues,"" is a testament to their continued power and influence.

The band's history is one of triumph over adversity, with members coming together from various other projects and overcoming personal struggles to create something unique and impactful. This album is the result of intense collaboration, with each member contributing their own distinct talents to the mix.

From the opening riff of ""Another River to Cross,"" it's clear that Goatsnake is firing on all cylinders. The guitar work is intricate and textured, with layers of sound that build to a thrilling climax. The vocals are rough and raw, adding a sense of urgency to the proceedings.

Throughout the rest of the album, the band twists and turns through a variety of moods and tempos. ""Dancing on the Sun"" is a standout track, with its propulsive rhythm and catchy chorus that will get stuck in your head for days. ""Elevated Man"" is another highlight, with its dark, brooding energy and ominous lyrics that hint at a world on the brink of collapse.

What makes ""Black Age Blues"" such a successful album is its willingness to explore the full range of its genre. There are moments of crushing heaviness, as well as moments of delicate beauty. From the sorrowful balladry of ""Jimi's Gone"" to the explosive power of ""House of the Moon,"" Goatsnake proves that they are masters of metal and more.

As a personal note, I found myself swept up in the band's energy and artistry, my head nodding along uncontrollably to the beat. While not every track on the album landed for me, there was enough here to make me a believer in Goatsnake's unique blend of metal and blues.

Overall, ""Black Age Blues"" is an impressive addition to Goatsnake's already stellar discography, and a testament to the band's continued relevance in the metal scene. Whether you're a diehard fan or a newcomer to the genre, this album is worth a listen. With a rating of 7.3 out of 10, it's not the band's strongest work, but it's still a powerful display of their talents and creativity.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed than Review B.

Django Django,Marble Skies,Pop/R&B,6.9,January 25 2018,Cameron Cook,Contributor,"Ever since their 2012 debut, Django Django have banked their popularity on their ability to mash as many genres as possible into one dense, heady sound. At their best, they sound like wide-eyed kids toying gleefully with an impressive arsenal of influences, ranging from ’60s psych to ’70s space rock, ’80s pop and ’90s indie, often within the same track. While this stylistic dexterity helped break them into the competitive independent UK scene of the early 2010s, it failed them on their overthought second record, 2015’s Born Under Saturn, where entire songs got lost in a fog of moody synths and splashy hi-hats. On the band’s third album, Marble Skies, all the typical elements of their music are front-and-center: the noodly vintage synthesizers, the bouncy disco basslines, frontman Vincent Neff’s falsetto. But where much of Saturn got buried under the weight of its own grandeur, here Django turn the dial ever so gingerly back towards the sound that, at one point, made them Mercury Prize-nominated electro-psych-rock children of tomorrow. At the same time, you can hear them striving for the evolutionary jump that eludes so many indie bands on their third records—trying to concoct something fresh and exciting without losing the momentum they’ve built thus far. While Marble Skies doesn’t always quite get there, the planets it frantically orbits while awaiting touchdown are worth the journey. Take the album’s title track. As straightforwardly enjoyable as anything Django has ever released, “Marble Skies” is a galloping, chugging pop song that positions the LP as not only spacey but fun—a quality that Django sometimes sacrifice in the name of intellectualism. It’s an explosion of vocoders, sing-along choruses, post-punk bass and harpsichord-styled keys straight out of “The Safety Dance.” The mixed-up sound is pure Django, but the commitment to good times feels new. They continue to take risks with “Surface to Air,” a vocal collaboration with Rebecca Taylor of the British folk duo Slow Club. Her smooth contralto, overlaid with a crackly sheen of reverb, recalls vintage Marianne Faithfull, while strange flourishes in the production, like a snare drum that sounds almost exactly like an asthmatic cough, give the track an out-of-time feel. The most memorable element of the song, though, is its dancehall-influenced melodies and percussion, which fit perfectly with the post-Rihanna tropical pop that has been dominating the charts for the better part of this decade. Elsewhere, Django Django battle their inclination for wink-nudge nerdism (there’s a slow, heavy track called “Beam Me Up,” which, we get it). And “Further,” which is supposed to be a country-tinged, desert-rock stomper, instead drones away without really anchoring to any one idea that Django haven’t explored many times before. “Tic Tac Toe” makes much better use of the band’s propensity for throwback sounds, taking sunbleached ’60s harmonies and punching them up with layered blasts of prog-rock. If the best songs on this album propose the idea of Django as pop stars, “In Your Beat” blows it into the stratosphere. The most realized song that the group has released since its debut, it’s a huge-sounding dance-rock groove that would have been an international hit had it been released in 2007. That sounds like a dig, but it’s really a testament to how well Django evoke the now-distant time when the intersection of indie and dance was at its strongest. Here in the present, Marbles Skies suggests that they still have either a great pop record or a mind-bending rock opus in them, if they ever feel like going all the way.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/django-django-marble-skies/,Ribbon Music,2018.0,"Django Django's latest album ""Marble Skies"" brilliantly delves into the realms of pop and R&B music, with an infusion of their unique sound to create a riveting listening experience that'll keep you hooked from beginning to end. With a rating of 6.9 out of 10, the album delivered beyond the expectations I had and surprised me in more ways than one.

It is impossible to talk about Django Django without mentioning their humble beginnings in Edinburgh in 2009. The Scottish band consists of four members: singer-guitarist Vinvent Neff, drummer David Maclean, bassist Jimmy Dixon, and keyboardist Tommy Grace. Their debut self-titled album released in the UK in 2012, and it was received with critical acclaim. Over time, they've evolved their sound, pushing boundaries, and expanding their musical vocabulary. Which brings us to their third studio album, ""Marble Skies.""

Django Django has worked hard to create a cohesive album that captures their musical identity while incorporating a touch of experimentation that sets it apart from their previous releases. ""Marble Skies"" begins with ""Marble Skies Intro,"" a short instrumental that opens the album with great vibes and sets the tone for what is to come.

The lead single, ""Tic Tac Toe,"" which was released before the album's release date, is a refreshing track with a catchy chorus and groovy earworm beats. The second track, ""Surface to Air,"" features guest vocals from Self Esteem, adding a dynamic touch to the mesmerizing track. Other tracks that stood out include ""Further,"" with its melodic vocals, synths, and guitar riffs, and ""Real Gone,"" a slow-burning R&B track with a fantastic chorus.

""Marble Skies"" weaves in and out of genres, blending and fusing them to create an eclectic mix that is unmistakably Django Django. The album explores themes of love, relationships, and identity, with a unique approach to storytelling. The lyrics are well-written, and the melody is perfectly crafted, resulting in a well-balanced album. The band's creativity and experimental sound might not be for everyone, but I applaud Django Django for putting together an album that showcases their unique style.

Overall, ""Marble Skies"" by Django Django is a refreshing breath of fresh air in the world of pop and R&B music. It's an album you can listen to over and over again and find something new to appreciate each time. While it's not perfect, it's definitely worth a listen, and I am excited to see what Django Django has in store for us in the future.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed than Review B.

Knowledge the Pirate,Flintlock,Rap,7.1,August 16 2018,Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,"Calling yourself the “first gangster to rap over Neptunes beats” is a bold claim—but it’s just one in a series of industry boasts Knowledge the Pirate has amassed in an under-the-radar career that goes back to the 1990s. The rapper, who splits his time between Harlem, Philadelphia, and New Jersey, was originally discovered by Will Smith’s de facto bodyguard, Charlie Mack, in a rap battle. He was flown to Hollywood to attend the Jack the Rapper industry convention, where he impressed new jack swing pioneer Teddy Riley and signed a short-lived deal with Interscope. Knowledge moved on to rhyming over early beats by Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo before Clipse became the Neptunes’ dope boys of choice; he also notched up ghostwriting credits on Will Smith’s Born to Reign. Throughout his musical moves, Knowledge maintained his street reputation, which allowed him to later brag, “I’m a real street dude. I’m not really bullshitting. I took Biggie Smalls’ girl.” But despite having his talent noticed by influential names, Knowledge grew impatient and distanced himself from the music world. During this hiatus, Knowledge struck up a friendship with Roc Marciano, who persuaded him to pick up the mic again and offered him guest spots on his albums. Roc is now enshrined as the figurehead of a revered strain of East Coast hip-hop that layers shadowy, backstreet vignettes over quietly menacing, soul-sampling production, and it’s this canon of contemporary thug-rap mood music that Knowledge’s long-coming debut, Flintlock, adds to. Roc handles a third of the production duties himself—along with dropping a guest verse on the celebratory, almost gloating “Cant Get Enough”—and the rest comes courtesy of in-camp allies Elemnt and Mushroom Jesus. Together, they create a grainy, soul-saturated backdrop that complements Knowledge’s gravel-voiced dispatches from the crime world. Knowledge’s declarative style is key to Flintlock’s appeal. He’s like a beat reporter: There is no room in his lyrics for overly tricksy wordplay or abstract ambiguity, just the cold restatement of facts detailing various nefarious and often brutal situations. If Roc Marciano is the slick-talking one in the room, Knowledge is the guy who very clearly warns everyone else what will happen if things do not go precisely to plan. There’s an ellipsis of violence in the steady tone of his voice even when he’s not documenting specific acts of retribution. Case in point: “Wrinkled Feathers” is bedded by an Elemnt beat that mixes sinewy organ lines with flashes of guitar twangs as Knowledge introduces himself, “Hand on my nine while I’m taking these orders.” He proceeds to deliver the latest report: “So many died swimming in these waters/They found that nigga last night, body parts stuffed in the storage/Now his team is stagnant and dormant/When they seen it on the news that that nigga was a government informant.” Going forward, Knowledge mandates his team carry out background checks before striking up new business relationships. It’s a logical solution to a dramatic scenario. The absence of gangsterized flights of fancy stamps Flintlock with an authentic feel. The understated way Knowledge relays tales of firearms and contraband—and alludes to the morals of the hustling game—heightens the tension. On the bluesy “Beers, Bullets & Bloodshed” he shows a keen eye for sketching a crime scene. A pit stop at a bar unravels to reveal a “musketeer over there standing on the stairs”; the young guns sitting at the back of the bar swigging vodka, we learn, are plotting to “knock ’em out they rocking chairs.” The nervy setup unfurls like a camera slowly panning to illuminate the scenario in painstaking detail. It’s this steady, mature hand that ultimately defines Flintlock—and gives credence to the potential that the Neptunes and Teddy Riley saw all those years ago.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/knowledge-the-pirate-flintlock/,Treasure Chest Entertainment,2018.0,"Hey there music lovers, today we're taking a deep dive into Knowledge the Pirate's latest album Flintlock. For those who are not familiar, Knowledge the Pirate is a rapper from Florida with a unique style that blends his love for hip-hop and reggae with his grit and raw hustle.

To give you a brief background, Knowledge the Pirate burst onto the scene in 2012, working closely with rap icon Roc Marciano. Over the last decade, he has dropped several mixtapes and collaborations and has become known for his street-smart lyrics and potent delivery.

Now, let's dive right into Flintlock. The album is a continuation of his iconic sound, but this time Knowledge the Pirate takes it to a new level. The album is a combination of hard-hitting beats, soulful samples, and confidence-laden verses. One of the things that stand out in the album is its ability to transport you into the street corners where Knowledge the Pirate learned his lessons.

The album's creation story is one that is worth discussing. It was entirely self-produced, and the Pirate went back to the drawing board to perfect it. The result is a cohesive album that stands as a testament to his growth as an artist.

In terms of standout tracks, ""Science Born"" is one that resonated with me on a personal level. The contrast between the gritty beat and the harmonic sample provides a backdrop for thoughtful lyrics about perseverance and resilience. It's a song that will have you nodding your head in agreement.

Another track that stood out to me was ""Headshot,"" featuring Roc Marciano. The collaboration between the two is one that longtime fans of the Pirate will appreciate. It's an excellent reminder of the chemistry between the two and the role they both played in shaping the Pirate's sound.

Overall, Flintlock by Knowledge the Pirate is an excellent album that continues to solidify his place in the rap game. It's a confident and well-executed project that speaks to the Pirate's growth as an artist. If you're a fan of classic hip-hop with a fresh twist, then Flintlock is an album that you need to add to your playlist. I give this album a rating of 7.1 out of 10.

Shlohmo,Bad Vibes,Electronic,7.8,August 11 2011,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Establishing a sonic personality without lyrical assistance or some unique personal backstory can be tricky, especially when you're in the middle of a room crowded with your peers. The space in question is the one with a ""for fans of Flying Lotus"" sign posted over the door, and there hasn't been a ton of vacancy in there lately. Those who've broken out have done so by tweaking the sonic imprint of decaying beats and melting analog chords until they come across as distinctly tactile things, humid and slippery, blown-out and elastic. Reaching out to clutch the music on Shlohmo's Bad Vibes might cause it to crumble in your grasp-- and then cut the hell out of your fingers. The L.A. producer's sophomore full-length comes after a handful of singles, EPs, remixes, and compilation appearances, as well as last year's disorienting debut, Shlomoshun Deluxe. And in that short yet busy time, Shlohmo has dredged up something strange: an aesthetic that's jaggedly delicate, filled with melodic beauty but jostled by abrasive percussive hitches, undercut with sandpapery patches of ambient fuzz. It's a deft merging of gentle, wafting electronic tones and intricately beat-to-shit rhythmic atmosphere, the sounds of old technology trying to reconcile its former gloss with its fading functionality. The cynical ears that still can't get past the nostalgic surface of chillwave might have their own bone to pick with the cassette-deck/VHS fidelity of Bad Vibes, which stands out pretty prominently in hissy tracks like ""Same Time"" and ""Parties"". But instead of celebrating corroded, neon-pastel magnetic-tape detritus for its own sake, the music on this album leans closer to an appreciation of the actual rhythmic counterpoints, quirks, and resonant qualities of white noise. Alongside the moments that seem to revel in the flutter and crackle of old equipment are stretches that draw similar vibes from the sound of literal rainfall (""Seriously"") or birdcall-strewn field recordings (""Big Feelings"")-- not to mention the texture you can get from good old-fashioned feedback, like the keyboard squall of ""Trapped in a Burning House"". The beats themselves are striking enough, whether they're the distant trickling clicks of ""Sink"" or the sharp, crisp snap-thump grooves that push along cuts like ""Places"" or ""Same Time"". Yet even the moments where the beat feels secondary to the other instrumentation have a pulse to them, run through floaty guitars or humming synthesizers that converse with the ambient hiss in compelling ways. Still, neither the melody nor the ambience overwhelms the other. It's easy to hear the silky, billowy tones through the dying-battery distortion, but hard to picture what they'd sound like without it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15698-bad-vibes/,Friends of Friends,2011.0,"If you're looking for an album that captures the essence of the dark and brooding side of electronic music, look no further than Shlohmo's ""Bad Vibes"". The LA-based producer has crafted a mesmerizing sonic landscape that immerses the listener in a world of melancholy and nostalgia. With a rating of 7.8 out of 10, this album is an exceptional piece of work that deserves attention.

Shlohmo began making music as a teenager and quickly gained a following on the internet for his idiosyncratic style. Drawing inspiration from hip-hop, ambient, and experimental music, he forged a sound that was uniquely his own. His debut album ""Bad Vibes"" was released in 2011 on the label Friends of Friends, and it was hailed as one of the most innovative and original electronic albums of the year.

The album's creation story is a fascinating one. Shlohmo reportedly spent countless hours in his bedroom studio crafting the album, layering intricate beats and textures over haunting samples to create a sound that was both otherworldly and deeply personal. The resulting 11-track collection is a sprawling journey through the dark recesses of the producer's mind. The mood is set from the very beginning, with the opening track ""Big Feelings"" setting a somber tone that is maintained throughout the album.

One of the standout tracks on ""Bad Vibes"" is ""Places"", which features ethereal vocals from Shlohmo himself. The track's dreamy atmosphere is complemented by the producer's introspective lyrics, which explore themes of isolation and loneliness. Another highlight is ""Trapped in a Burning House"", which starts off with a pulsing beat before giving way to a haunting piano melody. The track's name is a fitting one, as the sense of unease and tension that permeates the album is palpable throughout.

As a listener, I found ""Bad Vibes"" to be a deeply affecting album that struck a chord with me on a personal level. The way that Shlohmo is able to craft such evocative soundscapes is truly impressive, and the level of detail that went into every track is apparent. The album has a cinematic quality to it, and it's easy to imagine it as the score to a dark and brooding film.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of electronic music that pushes boundaries and explores new sonic territory, ""Bad Vibes"" is definitely an album worth listening to. Shlohmo's unique sound is both haunting and beautiful and rewards the attentive listener with a deeply immersive and emotional experience. With an overall rating of 7.8 out of 10, this album is definitely a standout in the electronic music world. Highly recommended.","1.

Konx-om-Pax,Caramel,Electronic,7.4,July 18 2016,Andy Beta,Contributor,"There’s no exact English translation for the Greek phrase Κόγξ ὀμ πὰξ, though it has been repurposed by English occultist Aleister Crowley and by Italian composer-mystic Giacinto Scelsi. “Light in extension” or “Light rushing out in a single ray” is the rough translation of Konx-om-Pax, which is also the handle for animator, graphic designer and electronic music maker Tom Scholefield. Scholefield’s visuals have informed many artists over the years, be they as cover art for Oneohtrix Point Never and Rustie, videos for Mogwai and Hudson Mohawke, or as part of Lone’s live show. His debut album Regional Surrealism was for the most part slow and downcast, but his four-years-in-the-making follow-up Caramel embodies the project name by embracing that notion of “light” in all its manifold meanings. As he recently stated in an interview, “this record was almost a therapy…an attempt to be aggressively positive.” It’s also about the flashing lights of the bygone rave era, and much like Jamie xx, Special Request, Lone et al., Scholefield approached his music as an homage and idealization of an era that ended well before he could experience it. As he admits in the same interview: “[It’s] kind of an imaginary nostalgia because I was just a kid at the time.” That fantasia of rave’s lights and strobes informs Caramel. Like these aforementioned acts, it's not so much about replicating those sounds—much less the ferocious drum programming—but rather the faded tracers and cornea-seared after images that remain. So while there are beats and thumps embedded in Konx-om-Pax’s tracks, they are secondary to the neon hues that wiggle atop them, bright as gummy worms. That sense of distance can make a tape-hiss heavy track like “Video Club” sound like dance music going chillwave, its infomercial-style melody and laser sounds a bit too on-the-nose. But on “Perc Rave,” Scholefield changes up that strategy, dropping a lashing rhythm that would scan as furious, if it didn’t sound like it was emitted by a drum machine left by the side of the road to sputter. Throughout, Konx-om-Pax toggles between the bliss of dance music and the visceral surge of noise, suggesting he’s taken the lessons of both Lone and Mogwai to heart. Some tracks even embrace that dichotomy: the first half of “Oren’s Theme” is a woozy loop of “ooo baby” as all manner of Aphex chimes blip about it. But just as it’s about to turn whimsical, belches of great noise overtake it, allowing just enough of those chimes back in to strike a balance. “Mega Glacial” suggests the Fairlights, Mallets and Bamboo mix as filtered through Boards of Canada’s murky melodicism. Too often, the album’s melodies suggest end credits, so that you might mistake the album winding down even at the midway point. And sometimes when the drums rise in the mix, it’s not to move your body but more to remind you of the underlying theme, distracting from the other textures. But for all of the album’s moments of luminous noise and rave earmarks, Caramel is at its best in its quieter moments, with “At the Lake” and “Rainbow Bounce” layering arpeggiated melodies until they shimmer like oil on a puddle. It’s fitting that its most gorgeous track is entitled “Radiance.” Beatless but gridded by what sounds like gently stroked rebar, Scholefield layers these blurry sounds carefully, the effect not unlike sunrise after a rave has wound down, when dawn light imbues everything with its glow.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22087-caramel/,Planet Mu,2016.0,"Caramel by Konx-om-Pax: A Luscious Electronic Treat

If you're looking for an album that transports you to an otherworldly dimension while retaining a distinctly human touch, then Konx-om-Pax's Caramel should definitely be one of your top choices. This Glasgow-based electronic musician has crafted a work that defies easy categorization while maintaining a cohesive and captivating sound that is sure to impress even the most jaded music lovers.

Before we dive into the depths of the music, let's talk a bit about Konx-om-Pax himself. Tom Scholefield, the brain behind the moniker, has been active in the music scene since the early 2000s, with a particular focus on electronic and experimental genres. In addition to his solo work, he has collaborated with a variety of artists, including Mogwai, Hudson Mohawke, and Rustie. He's also a talented graphic designer and animator, which is evident from the visually stunning album artwork and music videos associated with Caramel.

Now, let's explore the music itself. Caramel is a rich and multifaceted album that blends elements of ambient, house, techno, and even prog rock. From the opening track ""LA Melody"" to the hypnotic finale ""Owlflight"", Konx-om-Pax serves up a feast of intricate beats, ethereal textures, and subtle sonic details that reward repeated listens. The production values are top-notch, with each sound carefully crafted and placed in the mix to create a feeling of depth and space. And while the music is undeniably electronic, there's a warmth and human touch to it that makes it feel like you're experiencing a living, breathing organism rather than just a series of ones and zeroes.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Missing Something"". It starts with a deceptively simple piano melody before gradually adding layers of glitchy percussion, shimmering synths, and ghostly vocal samples. The track gradually builds in intensity before dropping away to a delicate outro, leaving you feeling both exhilarated and contemplative. Another highlight is ""Manhunter"", which features a propulsive beat and a bassline that yo-yos between distorted grooves and delicate plucks. The track has a seductive quality that's hard to resist, and it'll have you nodding your head and tapping your foot before you even realize it.

Of course, as with any album, there are a few weak spots. ""Säule Acid"" is a bit too repetitive for its own good, and ""Pain Sweat"" feels a bit aimless and underdeveloped. But these moments are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, and they don't detract from the overall quality of the album.

In summary, Konx-om-Pax's Caramel is a deliciously complex and rewarding album that showcases the talents of a musician who's at the top of his game. Whether you're a die-hard electronic fan or just someone who appreciates well-crafted music, this is an album that you owe it to yourself to check out. I, for one, am already eagerly anticipating what Konx-om-Pax has in store for us next.","Step-by-step reasoning:

Deerhoof,The Runners Four,Experimental,9.0,October 9 2005,Nick Sylvester,Contributor,"Pitchfork: You opened for Wilco recently. How was that? Greg Saunier: When I was in the audience, watching their show, they would start a song, and people next to me would start hugging each other because they loved that song. And I thought that was something that I would really aspire to. To do something where music becomes-- and this sounds ridiculous or pretentious or something-- but where music becomes more than just good music.* * * Any band taking cues from Wilco-- let alone the best band in the world-- that's hard to stomach. Says Dominique Leone, ""You don't always have to sound poignant to make poignant music."" But I appreciate Deerhoof's challenge here: to comb hair without cutting it, to wash face without popping all the pimples, to be the best band in the world, but beyond that, to be the most lovable, too. So tomorrow, Deerhoof put on their Tuesday best and release their first straight-up guitar-rock album-- short, dense songs packed into familiar forms, full-bodied vocals for unabashed, often gut-punching melodies, less herk-jerk, less of that house-of-cards spirit that coursed through Reveille and Apple O. Some people will miss that. Milk Man, Pt. 2? Not really. Deerhoof aren't holding back here so much as redistributing their energies; where before we found cute in the grotesque, now the opposite. My offer: I'll concede that Milk Man was poppy, watered down, desperate love shit if you'll actually listen close to The Runners Four and realize that it's onto something else entirely-- by turns jubilant, confused, afraid, angry, sad, relieved, all pretty poignant, yes. They've made us a hugging record. Nothing ridiculous or pretentious about hugging. Almost twice the length of their other LPs, The Runners Four plays not as one big song, but as three swoops of six or seven. That first swoop (from ""Chatterboxes"" to ""Odyssey"") might dishearten the diehard, at least initially. Drummer Saunier, famed for his freakish battery, barely touches the set, but in his absence we get compositional tension, which is sometimes more intense than Saunier's top-down. Dueling guitar lines bristle close in the rub (""Chatterboxes""), and harmonics stab away at Chris Cohen's existential pirate ballad ""Odyssey"": ""Pirates on an odyssey/ We ask the captain 'What will be?'"" Now pirates count for some of the biggest douchebags this world has ever seen, but they get scared, too-- people forget that. ""Wrong Time Capsule"" starts swoop #2 with Runners' most on-the-sleeves guitar riff, a cry to echo singer Satomi's dejected message in a bottle: ""Don't forget me yesterday/ 'Cause today's no place to stay."" The trill stays fever-high with unison chants on guitars and vox (""Scream Team""), folksy-bluesy confessions/comeuppance on ""After Me the Deluge"" (""Middle love I did do you harm whenever I want to""), up to ""Siriustar"", Deerhoof's sparse-to-gigantic guitar anthem, like nothing they've written before. I think it's about a werewolf. The next third dips into more emotionally resonant stuff-- the furthest capitulation of Deerhoof's animalism so far, where lyrically they can guess the emotions of all things living (people being chased by spies) or non-living (lightning rods). We can wonder, as they do, if lemons are sad when we eat them, stuff like that, though Deerhoof make sure to push things inside-out, rescuing something human from the rumination. Runners' gut-puncher, the third swoop rounds out with ""You're Our Two"" as needly guitar lines sandwich Satomi's image-heavy paranoia: ""Cast afloat on icy water/ Can I really leave?"" then ""Ark sailing/ Believe all fools or die."" A somber if slightly perplexing note to end on, it's the right one for this album. But Deerhoof don't leave us there. Instead they give us ""RRRRRRight"", a chirpy, stark, primitive cut Ã¡ la ""Come See the Duck"". Of course, after an album so unafraid to ask for our love, Satomi's ga-gas and oompah-oompahs feel somewhat inconsequential. Then I saw Deerhoof play the song live and understood why they have it here: The song is ginger, a palette cleanser as much for us as for them. Love what happened, they ask, forget what happened, start all over again. ",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2256-the-runners-four/,Kill Rock Stars,2005.0,"Hey there, music lovers! Today, we're delving into the experimental sounds of Deerhoof and their album 'The Runners Four'. After giving this album a thorough listen, I can confidently say that it's one of the most unique and impressive experimental albums I've ever come across, and it certainly deserves its 9.0 rating.

For those who aren't familiar with Deerhoof, they're a band that formed in San Francisco back in 1994, consisting of Satomi Matsuzaki on vocals and bass, John Dieterich and Ed Rodriguez on guitar, and Greg Saunier on drums. The band's sound is characterized by their eclectic blend of musical genres, ranging from rock to electronic and even avant-garde.

'The Runners Four' is Deerhoof's seventh studio album, released in 2005, and is often regarded as one of their most accomplished works. The album's creation story is an interesting one- according to the band, they spent months jamming and experimenting with new sounds, often recording their sessions on a portable recorder. After months of jamming, the band picked out the best bits and pieces from the recordings to create the tracks that make up the final album.

Now, let's get into the music itself. Right from the opening track ""Chatterboxes"", the listener is introduced to the band's unique sound- unexpected rhythms, intricate guitar work, and Satomi's melodic vocals (which, for the record, are sung entirely in English despite her being a native Japanese speaker). The album rarely slows down, with each track building upon the last in a kaleidoscopic journey through the band's musical influences.

One standout track for me was ""Twin Killers"", which features some seriously impressive guitar work from Dieterich and Rodriguez. The way the guitars dance around each other is truly mesmerizing, and when combined with Satomi's playful and energetic vocal delivery, makes for a truly unforgettable track.

But what I love most about this album is the way it manages to be experimental without ever feeling inaccessible or pretentious. Each track is packed with interesting sonic details and unexpected twists and turns, but it all comes together in a way that's completely enjoyable and easy to listen to.

In conclusion, 'The Runners Four' is an absolute must-listen for any fan of experimental music. It's rare to come across an album that manages to be both musically adventurous and completely accessible, but Deerhoof has pulled it off with aplomb. Give it a listen- you won't regret it!","1.

Talk Normal,Sugarland,"Experimental,Rock",7.8,November 17 2009,Marc Masters,Contributor,"A year after forming in 2007, Brooklyn's Talk Normal self-released Secret Cog, an EP filled with rigorous beats, post-punk dissonance, and the darkly evocative vocals of guitarist Sarah Register and drummer Andrya Ambro. Echoes of No Wave-era noisemakers-- particularly the dogmatic rants of Lydia Lunch's Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and the urgent abstractions of Ut-- were unmistakable. But the duo also has firm roots in the present New York underground, specifically the noise-rock of veteran trio Sightings, whose Richard Hoffman guested on Secret Cog's best track, ""33"". Not long after that debut, Talk Normal signed to Rare Book Room Records, enabling them to record their first LP, Sugarland, with producer and label-owner Nicolas Vernhes. This has naturally brought an increase in clarity and detail, but the band's propensity for thick noise and rhythmic tension hasn't waned. In fact, the essential grit and guts of their music have deepened. Songs and lyrics remain simple-- most tracks feature a repetitive beat and blunt statements like ""You had it coming,"" ""Don't shut me down,"" and, aptly enough, ""I believe in structure."" But the way the pair rides these patterns to bracing climaxes is deft and relentless. And their eerie horror-movie tone has grown, approaching the cavernous territory first dug out by the early dirges of Sonic Youth and Swans. That heavy atmosphere relies on Register's diverse, textured guitar, which is like a muscle stretched across the skeleton of Ambro's beats. She often begins songs with minimal chords, but soon morphs them into layered blare that sounds like Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo inhabiting one body-- or, perhaps more accurately, a multi-dimensional take on Lunch's spraying blasts. On strident pieces like ""In a Strangeland"" and ""Bold Face"", her churning noise matches the duo's coolly desperate howls. Later, her see-sawing treble on ""Transmission Lost"" adds hopeful swing to the call-and-response. And her guitar is the clear star of ""River's Edge"", a kind of ""Death Valley '69"" update that slowly loses its strict beat, indicating the duo can loosen up their rhythmic lock-step when they want to. In fact, you can hear seeds of expansion on the four tracks that follow ""River's Edge"". ""Uniforms"" offers a raga-like guitar figure; Ambro's drumming on ""Warrior"" has a digital crunch not far from slow-burn IDM; and ""Outside"" features a wiry, scraping saxophone. But it's on Sugarland's best track-- a cover of Roxy Music's ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache""-- where Talk Normal stretches farthest. Opening with three minutes of beatific synth and half-spoken vocals, the duo follows the original's ultimate line-- ""but you blew my mind""-- not with glam bombast, but muscular, stomping noise. It sounds less like Roxy Music than the Velvet Underground, particularly the moment when Lou Reed used the declaration ""and then my mind split open"" to throw ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" into overdrive. Talk Normal may not yet possess VU-level power, but the fact that they can even evoke such magic practically guarantees a promising future.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13662-sugarland/,Rare Book Room,2009.0,"Talk Normal’s “Sugarland” is a strikingly experimental rock album that succeeds in drawing out the perfect balance between sonic exploration and raw rock energy. As someone who’s always been into the avant-garde scene, I was immediately intrigued by the album’s eclectic sound, and needless to say, I wasn’t disappointed.

For a bit of background on this Brooklyn-based duo, Talk Normal originally burst onto the scene with their debut album “Secret Cog” back in 2009. Since then, they’ve steadily built an impressive following of fans drawn to their unique and eclectic sound. But with “Sugarland,” the band’s experimentation really takes center stage.

One of the elements that sets this album apart is Talk Normal’s ability to use space and build tension. Songs like “Baby, Your Hearts Too Big” and “Summer Dress” create a sense of repose that’s captivating and almost hypnotic. But that’s not to say the album lacks aggression - tracks like “XO” and “Shot This Time” are explosive, with thundering drums and scorching guitars that channel the raw energy of early punk rock.

What really struck me about “Sugarland,” however, is the way Talk Normal managed to create a sound beyond traditional rock instrumentation. The album features violins, saxophones, and even the sound of a sewing machine in places, all of which are layered on top of the raw rock foundation to create mind-bending soundscapes. It’s clear that the band wasn’t content with just making another run-of-the-mill rock album.

Overall, “Sugarland” is an impressive work of art that’s definitely worth multiple listens. While some might find it a bit difficult to approach at first, I encourage listeners to stick with it - not only is it an incredible display of musicianship, it’s a bold statement from a band not afraid to push the boundaries of experimentation. In my opinion, I’d give this album a solid 8 out of 10 - definitely not perfect, but definitely appreciated.","1.

Nicolai Dunger,Soul Rush,Rock,7.4,April 4 2002,Chris Dahlen,,"This one's for you sensitive types. And I don't mean sensitive as in ""fey,"" where the singer's every emotion curls up into a little ball. Nicolai Dunger is a hunky Swede who's made many a crowd of Scandi-boppers melt into puddles, and his latest album, Soul Rush, is big-time, unabashed pop. It's the sound of the first week of spring, of kids flying kites and playing doctor. This is an album you can throw on at a barbecue when you're flipping bratwursts and drinking cheap beer, and the cutest girl or bulkiest Abercrombie & Finch model will walk up and say, ""Hey, when did Van Morrison put out a new record?"" Yes, he sounds like Van Morrison, though his voice is deeper and more guttural. He chews every word like an inch-thick steak, and he slurs the lines so much that he almost sounds intoxicated-- until you realize that every note is right where he wants it. The country-like opener, ""I'd Rather Die,"" starts clean and simple, giving you a chance to get used to the voice; the tune is pretty, and the acoustic guitar appropriates the signature hook of ""Stand by Your Man."" And then, at the chorus, something just lets go: the steel pedal and organ swell, Magnus Ostrom starts bashing the drums with the lightest heavy touch-- and Dunger's voice soars while simultaneously digging ruts in the ground. Dunger's earlier albums were more austere, and sometimes experimental; in the past he's even worked with folks like Robert Fripp. But it's not a slight to say that this album is easy on the ears, and his experience shows not through any sense of adventure but through good taste and craftsmanship. ""Dr. Zhivago's Train"" spins on a catchy guitar riff, trainlike drums and blasts of horns, underscored by weird electronic noodling-- all sweeping around a killer chorus, with the most convincing ""oooh-oooh-oooh"" to come from a blue-eyed soul singer in years. BjÃ¶rn Yttling's arrangements are impeccable but organic, swelling out of nowhere but hitting with just enough power-- for example, the horn section on ""Ballad of a Relationship,"" offering fitting accompaniment for Dunger's ruminations. The piano and violin on ""Return of Love"" contribute to a song that's more kicky than blue-- imagine a drunk Randy Newman singing the theme from Toy Story-- yet even here, the chorus can't help but take off. Even when they verge on cheesy, like the second-string Lyle Lovett-styled horns of ""Something New,"" they're balanced by the severity of Dunger's throaty vocals. ""It makes me feel free,"" and, ""I want something she can't give me"" may not be Strindberg (or Morrison), but I defy you to make out enough of these lyrics to mind. In any case, Dunger has several nice turns, like ""Lick my soul,"" from the title song. The serious moments on the album-- his solo features like the title track and the fragment-like ""Nest""-- have genuine weight, and the last song, ""Pass the Chains,"" is a downer, with grim guitar and a creepy piano resonating quietly behind. Dunger's somber moments are brought in as if to remind us he's a heavy soul, no matter how pretty the album can be. But I'm not sold. The ballads are nice, yet they don't have the punch of the brighter moments; this is a record that can't stop to brood.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2480-soul-rush/,Virgin,2001.0,"When it comes to the genre of rock music, there are a ton of different sub-genres and styles that can be appreciated by a wide variety of listeners. However, for those who prefer an authentic and raw sound, Nicolai Dunger's ""Soul Rush"" is a must-listen. As someone who has always had a soft spot for artists who push their limits to deliver something truly unique and memorable, I was blown away by the caliber of Dunger's work.

For those out of the loop, Nicolai Dunger is an artist from Sweden who has been tirelessly honing his craft for over two decades. His work has been praised for its ability to blend genres and create a sound that is both soulful and full of rock-and-roll grit. With ""Soul Rush,"" Dunger has crafted a sonic masterpiece that shows how far he's come since his early days as an artist.

The album is smoothly produced, with a great balance of acoustic and electric elements that add energy and depth to each track. The opening track, ""Long Long Long Time,"" sets the tone perfectly with its bluesy guitar riff and Dunger's smooth yet powerful vocals. The songwriting throughout the album is top-notch, with each track telling a story that pulls the listener in and refuses to let go.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Summer Days,"" a stripped-back acoustic track that showcases Dunger's incredible songwriting abilities. The song is a beautiful ode to the joys of summertime, infused with nostalgia and Dunger's signature blend of rock, blues, and folk. Another great track is ""Can't Go Wrong,"" which features a driving rhythm section and Dunger's soaring vocals. The chorus is incredibly catchy, and the lyrics are relatable and memorable.

Overall, ""Soul Rush"" is an impressive album that highlights everything that makes Nicolai Dunger a standout musician. If you're looking for an album that is full of soulful energy and powerful rock and roll, this one is definitely worth checking out.  While it's not my personal favorite rock album, I can see why it earns a rating of 7.4 out of 10 -- it's a solid effort and one that any true rock fan can appreciate.","Step 1: Review A uses more colorful and descriptive language, while Review B is more straightforward.

Nine Inch Nails,Ghosts I-IV,Rock,5.0,April 2 2008,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"When Trent Reznor got his Just Blaze on last year to produce the Saul Williams slam-opera The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, he sent it out into the world through a just-blazed distribution path, biting Radiohead's weeks-old pay-what-you want idea. Then, when not enough people paid actual money for the thing, he bitchily blogged about it. Now he's doing it again, this time under his own name. If you want the new NIN all-instrumental 36-track drone-marathon, you can pay as little as $5 or as much as $300. (Or, rather, you could have once paid as much as $300; the 2,500-copy limited run of the deluxe-packaging version of Ghosts I-IV sold out within three days.) That Radiohead model, it turns out, only works if you're a band on Radiohead's or Nine Inch Nails' level-- one with an arena-rock history and a rabid internet fanbase. Reznor stands to make millions from Ghosts, something that certainly wouldn't have been true if he'd released this two-hour 4xCD instrumental work on a major label. Reznor's defection from the music business might be the best thing that ever happened to him financially and ideologically. Aesthetically, it might be the worst. Reznor's greatest strength has always been his ability to let his fundamental pop sensibility show through his fuzzed-out industrial signifiers and screaming-at-a-wall tantrum-rock pretensions. For all its heavily processed walls of guitar and reptilian electro lurching and cusswords, Pretty Hate Machine, still my favorite of Reznor's albums, is basically a dirtied-up Human League album (and Human League albums, it turned out, could stand to be dirtied up). The gas-masks, megaphone yowls, and apocalyptic despair of his subsequent albums were fun, but his old-school devotion to song form and titanic hooks were the real reasons I once carved the NIN logo on a treehouse wall. As a producer, Reznor knows how to stack drones on top of each other and crystallize pianos like nobody else, but those studio tricks don't add up to much when he's not welding them to actual songs. There's not a song to be found anywhere on Ghosts; nearly every one of the untitled instrumental sketches here feels emaciated and half-finished. What we're left with is two hours' worth of really good soundtrack music for American remakes of Japanese horror films. In the 90s, Reznor played patron saint to IDM OGs, commissioning Aphex Twin remixes and signing Meat Beat Manifesto to his nothing label. In that regard, Ghosts is almost Reznor's IDM record, only he's never been all that interested in jittery side-panning drum programming or vintage-synth blob-farts. And this isn't ambient music either; nearly every piece here feels like a piece of a Nine Inch Nails song, a DVD extra to a movie we might never see. Many of the best tracks here are straight-up fuzz-rock stomps, but without the burden of lyrical conveyance or song-progression, that riffage just hangs there, churning without purpose. Elsewhere, Reznor pits staticy drones against each other to see what happens, and often there's a built-in sense of melody and a dynamic force at work; it's just frustrating that we never hear what Reznor might do with it. Sometimes he'll bury chattering electro beats under forebodingly tortured synth-tones. Sometimes he'll offer shockingly clear impressionistic Erik Satie-esque pianos, letting them plink prettily away for minutes at a time before sending some new ominous machine-hum to molest them. Every once in a while, he'll use a riff or a bassline that I could swear he's used before but can't quite place. But even if every one of these tracks stands as a formal experiment unto itself, after an hour or two these half-formed ideas begin to bleed indistinctly into each other, evolving into puddles of vaguely ominous aural mush. When Ghosts works best, it's as a showcase for Reznor's estimable studio skills. Plenty of the individual sounds here are just gorgeous, and Reznor even expands his palette a bit to encompass marimbas, banjos, and percussively Beck-like slide-guitar. He layers these sounds expertly, setting glassy pianos against distant roaring-siren counterpoints or interrupting a pulsing drone-hum with a surprisingly accessible bar-rock chug. But even as the tracks progress, nothing really goes anywhere or stands on its own-- even the best track here is essentially half of a really good Nine Inch Nails song. And maybe it still will be; Reznor could take the pieces here and and make great songs out of them, sort of like how James Murphy took a beat from his Nike-sponsored long-form LCD Soundsystem piece 45:33 to make the incandescent ""Someone Great"". Until then, though, we're left with pieces of songs, nothing more. If I were one of those early deluxe-pacakge customers, I'd want my $300 back.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11289-ghosts-i-iv/,The Null Corporation,2008.0,"The music industry is notorious for producing mediocre music that fails to leave a lasting impression on audiences. Yet every once in a while, a band comes along that manages to defy expectations and produce music that leaves listeners blown away. Nine Inch Nails is one such band, and their 2008 album ""Ghosts I-IV"" is a testament to that.

For those unfamiliar, Nine Inch Nails is a band that has been pushing the boundaries of rock music since their formation in 1988. The band was the brainchild of Trent Reznor, who started as a one-man industrial force before evolving into a full-fledged band. Over the years, the band has released numerous albums that have garnered critical acclaim and commercial success. ""Ghosts I-IV"" is one of their most intriguing and experimental albums, as Trent Reznor decided to release it as an entirely instrumental album, with no vocals.

The story behind the album's creation is just as fascinating as the music itself. Trent Reznor revealed that he was going through a personal and creative crisis at the time, and this led him to experiment with new ways of expressing himself through music. The result was the creation of a four-part instrumental project, which he released independently, allowing for complete artistic control and freedom.

The ""Ghosts I-IV"" album is, in a word, mesmerizing. As a longtime Nine Inch Nails fan, I was both surprised and captivated by the album's unorthodox sound. While there are hints of the band's signature industrial sound, the music on this album is entirely different from anything they had done before. Each track is unique, yet the album manages to form a cohesive sound that feels cathartic and transcendent.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""14 Ghosts II"", which is hauntingly beautiful, featuring an ethereal piano melody that is both calming and emotional. The album's opener, ""1 Ghosts I"", is another standout track that features an intricately layered sound that builds gradually into a complex and mesmerizing sound. Another personal favorite of mine is ""31 Ghosts IV"", a track with a brooding and ominous feeling that perfectly captures the darker side of the band's sound.

Overall, ""Ghosts I-IV"" is an impressive and experimental album that showcases what can be achieved when an artist is willing to take risks and push the boundaries of their creativity. While this may not be the album for fans who are looking for traditional Nine Inch Nails rock songs, those willing to give this album a chance will be rewarded with a sonic journey that is both unique and unforgettable. With an unconventional approach and the absence of vocals, the album may be a bit challenging at first, but it is well worth diving into and exploring.","1.

Four Tet,Angel Echoes Remix,Electronic,7.6,July 29 2010,Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,"This isn't a new Four Tet studio album. The digital release of ""Angel Echoes"", the latest single from Four Tet's There Is Love in You, includes ""Angel Echoes"" remixes by Caribou and Jon Hopkins and bundles them together with previously released, vinyl-only remixes of ""Love Cry"" and ""Sing"". The contributors include some of the most interesting names in dubstep and bass music -- Joy Orbison, Roska, Floating Points, Mosca, Hardhouse Banton-- but there are still only three tracks of source material here. Even the sequencing simply bundles the material in batches, although album flow becomes less important in the rip-and-burn era. Commissioned to reflect Four Tet's interests as a club DJ, the tracks are perfect playlist fodder, but the collection isn't something you're likely to listen to front to back. That said, it's high time that many of these reworks became widely available. Joy Orbison's remix of ""Love Cry"" is nearly as good as his own ""Hyph Mngo"" and possibly even better than his other singles. Somehow, he's managed to convert the rickety disco of the original into something fleet and flickering. Giving Orbison those vocals to work with must have been like offering catnip to a kitten, and he does exactly what you'd expect, looping them into short, insistent bursts. Rearranging the track's core elements according to his own signature, he turns the track into an example of dubstep at its lushest, its lunging, half-time cadence and whipcrack syncopations sounding more urgent than the original. Three mixes come from the fertile, hard-to-define terrain of the UK funky scene. Roska makes his muscular, sidewinding bass line the star of his ""Love Cry"" remix, using tuned percussion and a DJ Mujava-like synth lead to sketch out the harmonic outlines of the track. Only scraps of the original vocal remain, and they're so abstracted that you might not even recognize them if you heard the record out of context. The track's clean lines and percussive clarity make for an exciting contrast to Four Tet's deliberately swampy aesthetic. Hardhouse Banton, another UK funky producer, offers something more like an edit: His remix of ""Sing"" preserves the structure of the original, content to strengthen the groove with rolling, shuffling percussion (including funky's telltale loping toms, echoes of reggaeton). It's a subtle update, but listen back to the original, also included here, and you'll realize how much force he's given it. Mosca, affiliated with the UK's Night Slugs crew, clearly had a similar idea for his take on ""Sing"", which thrums with grinding, swinging percussion; what's interesting here is to see how Mosca translates Four Tet's swirled and swollen aesthetic to more forceful dance-floor standards, with white-hot hi-hats and syncopated chord stabs lending lean muscle. ""Angel Echoes"", reprised from the album, is all harps and chimes and swooping vocals, quintessentially Four Tet. Caribou, Four Tet's friend and musical peer, adds techno intensity (including triplet pulses inspired by James Holden, a peer of both musicians), but the soaring vocals feel slightly out of place-- too obvious a way of gaining lift, when the chugging momentum beneath would have sufficed. Jon Hopkins, a producer who has worked with Brian Eno and Coldplay, focuses on the music-box intimacy of ""Angel Echoes"", using electric bass and smeary layers of reverb to add depth and heft. It's lovely, but its tempo feels slightly staid in comparison to other tracks on the album. Four Tet's ""Sing"" also returns from the album, but in an extended version that draws out the seven-minute track to nearly 11. The essential feeling of the track is the same, but it benefits from the added room to move, stretching out the cooing vocals (echoes of BjÃ¶rk) over rattling drum breaks and emphasizing a long, graceful arc. London's Floating Points, one of the most exciting producers to emerge in the past year or so, steps up to the challenge with a 14-minute remix of the track. It begins with a long, lazy intro of sunrise Rhodes and birdsong oscillators before exploding into a great, shuddering mass of synthesizers, voice, and, somewhere in there, a faint glimmer of percussion. It's hard to know what to call it-- house, dubstep, a fusion of the two?-- but ultimately it doesn't matter; like Four Tet, Floating Points obviously knows that some of the most compelling dance music sounds nothing like the standardized formats that inspired it. One of the great things about Four Tet's recent music has been its increasing engagement with house and techno-- while, at the same time, refusing to play by club music's rules. To see Four Tet's idiosyncratic ideas keep filtering into club culture in such unpredictable ways is immensely rewarding.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14509-angel-echoes-remix/,Domino,2010.0,"If you're a fan of electronic music, then Four Tet's Angel Echoes Remix album is definitely worth exploring. This particular album captures the essence of the electronic music genre -- haunting soundscapes, intricate melodies, and hypnotic beats that transport your mind to another place.

Before delving into the tracklist, it's worth noting Four Tet's musical history. The project, lead by Kieran Hebden, began in the late 90s and has since become a cornerstone in the electronic music scene. With a career spanning over two decades, Hebden has proven himself to be a master of sonic experimentation, combining elements of jazz, dub, and techno to create captivating soundscapes.

In Angel Echoes Remix, Four Tet does not disappoint. The album showcases remixes of his original tracks from the album 'There Is Love in You'. However, these remixes are not merely a rehashing of old material; rather, they're a reimagining of Four Tet's artistic vision.

Opening the tracklist is a remix of ""Angel Echoes"" and it sets the tone for the rest of the album. There's a sense of otherworldliness in the music, with a lullaby-like melody providing a surreal background to the underlying beat. ""Circling,"" another remix, is a personal favorite for me. There's a depth and intricacy to the music that draws me in, and makes me hit the replay button again and again.

Throughout Angel Echoes Remix, Four Tet effortlessly blends elements of different genres. From the drum and bass-infused ""Love Cry"" to the ambient tones of ""This Unfolds,"" every track provides a unique sonic experience.

For me, the highlight of the album is the last track -- a remix of ""Angel Echoes"" by Caribou. It's a fitting end to a stunning record, with Caribou adding his own touch to the already impressive original. The remix is an exercise in patience, slowly building up the tension before reaching a satisfying climax.

All in all, I would rate Angel Echoes Remix a solid 7.6 out of 10. It's a thoughtfully crafted album that showcases Four Tet's musical genius. The tracks are meticulous, without ever seeming sterile or overproduced. Each song tells a story, and together, they provide an auditory journey that is well worth diving into.","1.

Baka Not Nice,4Milli,Rap,4.7,August 8 2018,Stephen Kearse,Contributor,"Like all OVO Sound signees, Baka Not Nice’s role within Drake’s fiefdom is defined by how Drake sees him. Since his introduction on “From Time” from Nothing Was the Same, Baka has been styled as the label’s resident goon, a no-nonsense bruiser who puts loyalty and integrity above all. In Drake’s eyes, Baka represents Toronto’s unsung underbelly, a land of accents, culture, and danger. Before Drake could go global, he had to establish his pull over a global city, and Baka, his former bodyguard, was his man on the ground. As a rapper, Baka embraces the role Drake has laid out for him to a fault. On 4Milli, he raps with a joyful gracelessness, forgoing wit or emotion and opting for menace. He lives to pull cards and check posers, to hurl insults and to flex. His sole interests are intimidation and keeping it real; rapping comes second.  This emphasis on power and reputation sets Baka apart from the Drake-lite crooners that fill OVO’s roster (dvsn, Majid Jordan, PARTYNEXTDOOR, etc.), and he clearly enjoys all the chest-puffing—but his goon raps are largely bland and unmemorable. Baka Not Nice actually does live up to his name: His music is literally without style or flourish. Rap has a rich history of straight shooters, but Baka’s straight talk is so unimaginative it’s taxing. When he uses humor to color his insults, he’s so unsubtle he sounds like a parody of a bully. “I’mma catch you niggas when I choose to/Sliding down your block just to shoot you/Like doot-do, do-do-doot-do,” he sings on “Money in the Bank.” On “Cream of the Crop” he growls into the mic while detailing a hook-up...because he’s sooo beasty in bed. When he tells stories, he somehow omits characters, setting, and plot. His vignette of a drug deal on “Dope Game” is so sparse and lifeless, it’s nearly a koan: “Told him to meet me in person/He met me in person, he froze.” This limited skill set is most constrained when Baka alludes to his time in prison. His rap sheet includes armed robbery and assault and he was once detained and held in custody for 10 months for assault and human trafficking (the charges were later dropped). These bids and the circumstances around them are frequently evoked across 4Milli, yet they never have context or weight. On “Live Up to My Name,” for instance, Baka says that he began a sentence on the day Men in Black was released (July 2, 1997) and left when “Timberlake was bringing sexy back” (~July 18, 2006). It’s a jarring and clever way to render how much of a time-warp incarceration can be, but Baka goes no further. The before, the after, and the jail time itself dissolve into the generic boast that follows: “Facts, nigga, facts.” Baka ends 4Milli by accosting hangers-on that weren’t with him before his come-up. “Where the fuck were you when the judge gave me 13 years, nine months? Where the fuck were you, when my pops was in the courtroom, in shock? Where were you when I was down below? Yo, I got convicted of something I ain’t even fucking do, my nigga,” he rants on the outro of “Gimme That Work.” These questions are rhetorical, but 4Milli is so placeless, impersonal, and disjointed that even hypothetically, it’d be hard to muster either answers or concern. Across 25 torturous minutes, Baka doesn’t make a single lasting impression as a performer, storyteller, or craftsman. He’ll do well on OVO.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/baka-not-nice-4milli/,"OVO Sound,Warner Bros.",2018.0,"Hello and welcome to my review of Baka Not Nice's latest album, 4Milli. As someone who appreciates rap music, I was eager to give this album a listen, especially after learning about Baka's unique background as a former Drake bodyguard turned rapper.

From the first track, it was clear that 4Milli was going to be a mix of classic street rap and modern trap beats, with Baka's deep and raspy voice setting the tone. One thing I appreciated was the variety of features on the album, from Giggs to Juicy J, which brought different sounds and perspectives to Baka's world.

Listening to the album, I learned about Baka's life through his lyrics, from his time in prison to his rise in the music industry. It's clear that he's faced many struggles and obstacles, which gave weight to his words and made them hit home. In songs like ""Junior High,"" Baka touches on his difficult upbringing and the pain of losing friends to gun violence. These personal moments in his music showcase how he's more than just a typical rapper spitting about material possessions.

However, as much as I enjoyed learning about Baka's story, there were a few issues with the album that held it back from greatness. Firstly, while the beats were solid, there were moments where they felt too generic and lacking in creativity. I wanted to see Baka take more risks with his sound and push boundaries rather than sticking to what's already been done.

Additionally, the album didn't have much cohesion, with each song feeling somewhat disconnected from the others. While it's clear that Baka has a range of emotions to explore in his music, the transitions between tracks made it hard to follow a clear narrative.

Overall, I'd give 4Milli a solid 7 out of 10. While there were issues with generic beats and a lack of cohesion, I appreciated Baka's honesty and personal touch in his music. It's clear that he has the potential to become even greater with future albums, and I'm excited to see where he goes next.","1.

Carter Tutti,Carter Tutti Plays Chris & Cosey,Experimental,7.0,February 18 2015,Nick Neyland,Contributor,"The past is so present in today's musical landscape that you can easily connect the dots when an artist looks backwards. A greatest-hits tour on its third go-around or a lengthy set of dates performing a single album from start to finish—both reek of good ideas gone stale, or some form of stasis winning out over creative urges. The difference between a cash grab and a victory lap feels ever more slight. Of course, it’s not always that way. There’s even something to be said for artists approaching their back catalog with a sort of humorous disdain. In the late 1980s, art-punks Wire reformed, only to announce they wouldn’t play any of their older material, instead hiring a cover band, the Ex-Lion Tamers, to perform that function in the opening slot of their shows. The approach Wire took for those concerts—essentially not giving fans what they want, even actively antagonizing them—is a feeling with which Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti, founding members of industrial behemoths Throbbing Gristle, are acutely familiar. These are people, after all, who were once deemed the ""wreckers of civilisation."" Carter Tutti have been addressing their past, in various tours and reissue programs, for more than 10 years at this point. Their path through it is often inspired, with the dissolution of the reunited Throbbing Gristle leading to the excellent X-TG album. In tandem, their brittle electronic music as Chris & Cosey began to cast a long influence over body music-inspired artists such as Factory Floor, culminating in a fully energized collaboration with that band’s Nik Colk Void. Since 2011, the pair have been sporadically playing dates where they take a fresh approach to the Chris & Cosey material, stripping it of the production trappings of the various eras they draw on, instead replacing it with something tougher and far more impactful. This is the recorded document to accompany those shows, put together in Carter Tutti’s studio in the English countryside. It’s a sound that meshes elements of their past lives—the fussy electronics speak of Carter’s career as a synth boffin and TV sound engineer, while the pulsing backing and breathy vocals hark to Tutti’s work as a stripper. Tutti even recalled as much in a recent Wire interview. ""I was bringing back things like Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder from my stripping,"" she said, of Throbbing Gristle’s attempted turn to that sound. Carter Tutti Plays Chris & Cosey illustrates the extent to which Carter Tutti are still enamored with dousing raw electronics in a seedy, heavily sexualized tone. Much of the album moves at a trance-like pace, strung somewhere between something you can either dance to or zone out on. The opening ""Lost Bliss"" (from Megatropolis) and ""Driving Blind"" (from Songs of Love & Lust) are highlights, bringing in a pop edge and much fuller production than the originals—a signature strung throughout most of these reworkings. It’s possible to hear legions of electronic acts from the past decade or so in here, including Zola Jesus, Ladytron, even Fischerspooner, making it easy to conclude that Tutti’s vocal style—masterfully disengaged no matter what the subject matter—might be one of the great unheralded influences of the 2000s. It’s not hard to see why the Carter Tutti/Factory Floor relationship flourished so fruitfully when working through this material. Both work from a starting point that’s largely unmoveable—rippling Moroder electronics, a pinch of dance culture that’s more observatory than participatory—and drive their point into the ground over the course of an album. The shift from ""Beatbeatbeat"" (from Exotica) to ""Workout"" (a 1987 single) highlights how they build with remarkably similar tools then subtly corrupt the formula from within. ""Workout"" is wonderfully obliterated by Tutti’s railroad guitar lines, which butt up against chunky synth patterns that divert close to the whiteout assault of 808 State’s ""In Yer Face"" (a track actually released a few years after ""Workout""). Overhauling prior work may not be the most unique tool in the backward facing bandwagon of old lags giving the circuit one last run-around. But the difference with Plays Chris & Cosey is of a duo pushing beyond what came before instead of resting too heavily on things that already exist, in much the same way as it was in the general atmosphere of the X-TG album. They make revisiting the past sound like a creative place to be, where latent potential is given some room to breathe in the noxious, leather-fueled atmosphere of these songs. An important aspect, perhaps, is that Carter Tutti have myriad contemporary projects they’re working on at the same time as addressing material like this. As such, this record reads like an object lesson in how former glories are sometime best served by becoming a malleable part of the present.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20231-carter-tutti-plays-chris-cosey/,Conspiracy International,2015.0,"If you're into experimental music, you need to take a listen to Carter Tutti's latest release, ""Carter Tutti Plays Chris & Cosey"". This album bears the imprints of history and innovation, mixing together old and new with aplomb.

Let's start with some background history. Carter Tutti was formed by Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti, who had already made a name for themselves as founding members of industrial legends Throbbing Gristle. After that band broke up, Carter and Tutti continued to make music as a duo, drawing on their experiences in the burgeoning punk and electronic music scenes. Their music was experimental, blending together elements of industrial, dance, and rock, and drew a sizable following.

Fast forward to the present, and Carter and Tutti are still making music under the moniker Carter Tutti. Their latest release sees them revisiting their past, as they rework and reinterpret some of their own classic tracks from their time as Chris & Cosey. Despite the familiarity of some of the material, this album is anything but a rehash, as Carter and Tutti twist and contort the songs into new and compelling shapes.

The tracks on this album range from dark and moody to upbeat and danceable, and Carter and Tutti are masters of mood and atmosphere. They create immersive soundscapes that envelop the listener, drawing you in with complex rhythms and hypnotic melodies. Even on the tracks with vocals, the lyrics are often more about texture and tone than actual words. This is music that speaks to the subconscious and the emotions, rather than the intellect.

Of course, this is experimental music, so not everyone will be into it. But for those who are, ""Carter Tutti Plays Chris & Cosey"" is a triumph. It's not just a nostalgic trip down memory lane, but a bold and inventive reimagining of a classic sound. This is music that challenges and rewards the listener, making you see the world in a new light. In my opinion, it's an album that deserves a solid 7.0 out of 10.","1.

Lesser Gonzalez Alvarez,Why Is Bear Billowing?,Folk/Country,6.7,August 21 2008,David Bevan,Contributor,"Nearly all of Cuban-born, Baltimore-based Lesser Gonzalez Alvarez's debut long-player is just him and his acoustic guitar, a particularly odd combination given the Wham City membership card he carries. While you've probably become familiar with that collective's Sparks-fueled spazz-offs (see: Dan Deacon, Videohippos, Death Set, and Ponytail), Gonzalez is steeped in Anglophilic folkie steez, shaking hands with the likes of Donovan and Fairport Convention but keeping to a cartoonish, lyrical sensibility that owes as much to the songwriter's own visual art as it does from the poetry of Edward Lear, whose ""The Owl and the Pussycat"" is adapted here. It's a weird fit for his scene's humid, hypercolor warehouse freak-outs. Yet despite large helpings of whimsy, Gonzalez's wan-pleasant songs don't feel as vibrant as those of his peers. Opener ""A Magic"" is a buttered, breakfast commercial strummer that Gonzalez trots out of the driveway with ease. It's a strong statement with simple aims, but its lyrical repetition drains it of any romance. Its pacing remains steady throughout. ""Pinecone Eyes""-- dragged down by icy fingerpicking and magic realist lyrics-- is one of a few tracks that recalls the feathery vibrato of Devendra Banhart. Ditto that for closer ""Mostly a Friend"", a castanet-enhanced earworm with Latin juices. But for the most part, chord progressions are familiar and warm; the leapfrogging of ""Build a Tiny Hill"" has the fragile lilt of a new Death Vessel lullaby and ""Love for Longer"" features a stunning ascending melody. Gonzalez has a ragged way with his acoustic guitar that augments the record's matchlit feel; I just wish he'd let loose more often-- maybe even plug in.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12108-why-is-bear-billowing/,Carpark,2008.0,"If you're into Folk/Country, you might have heard of Lesser Gonzalez Alvarez. He's been making music for over a decade, and he's known for his unique sound and soulful voice. Lesser's latest album, ""Why Is Bear Billowing?"" has been making waves in the music scene, and for good reason.

The album is a mix of introspective ballads and upbeat tunes that make you want to tap your feet. Lesser's voice is as mesmerizing as ever, and it's clear that he put a lot of heart and soul into this album. The title itself may seem quirky, but it's actually a reference to a poem by Ted Hughes, which Lesser drew inspiration from.

The album was created in a remote cabin, deep in the woods of Virginia. Lesser wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and be surrounded by nature, which is reflected in the music. He recorded most of the album on his own, with the exception of a few guest musicians who added their own touches to the songs.

One of the standout tracks is ""Wilderness"", which is a hauntingly beautiful song about finding peace in solitude. Lesser's voice is paired with a simple acoustic guitar and the sound of birds chirping in the background, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere.

Another track that caught my attention was ""Broken Bird"", which has a more upbeat tempo and a catchy chorus that sticks in your head. The lyrics tell the story of a bird that's been set free, and how it navigates through life's challenges.

Overall, ""Why Is Bear Billowing?"" is a solid album that showcases Lesser Gonzalez Alvarez's talent as a songwriter and musician. The fusion of Folk and Country elements make for a unique and refreshing sound that's perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon or a long drive down a country road.

I would give this album a 7 out of 10. While I appreciate the beauty and craftsmanship of the music, I feel like there were a few moments where the pacing felt a bit uneven, and some of the songs felt too short.

J-Zone,Peter Pan Syndrome,Rap,7.5,September 12 2013,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"J-Zone never set out to make failure his career's overarching theme-- Failure just zeroed in on him to the point where he incorporated it into his persona, accepting it enough that he came across as someone more levelheaded than just another bitter, aging rapper complaining about not having made it. Not that he deserved that kind of fate; in a just world his punchline-barrage insult comedy bars and no-bullshit boom-bap should've introduced at least a couple of his records into the collections of future Scribble Jam battlers. But even on 2001's Pimps Don't Pay Taxes-- the album that broke him through to his cult audience-- he was stressing about illegal downloaders and the prospect of being permanently stuck underground, unable to afford a Caddy with some dice in the mirror. Disillusionment set in by the end of 2008, when the realization finally set in that his DIY-fueled hobby had become a slog of a job. After swapping out his music career to focus more on his writing, his 2011 industry-casualty memoir Root for the Villain and his rap-encyclopedia columns for ego trip provided a less stressful outlet for his wiseass insight. And yet here he is again with a new record. It's not a contractual obligation, not something that sounds like he forced himself to make it, not a convenient tie-in to his now two-year-old book. It's him in his home studio putting together vintage-sounding beats and talking that same brand of shit he trafficked in when he did it for the love a dozen years ago. Bandcamping it circumvents the dilemma of having pallets of unwanted copies in some Fat Beats back room waiting to be destroyed. But other than that, he put it all together with the same old fervor-- self-enforcing low-tech limitations on the production process and avoiding anything outside his came-up-in-the-80s wheelhouse. Peter Pan Syndrome is such a focused and niche-satisfying record that it likely wouldn't work worth a damn if J-Zone didn't have his heart in it, but in what appears to be a welcome 180, he goes off and performs like somebody who's never been burned by the business. Peter Pan Syndrome initially seems like a comedic exercise in balancing the crass barb-spitting of his younger self and the aging cynic who sees things changing in ways he doesn't like. His crankiness at the expectations of the dating world is where things get the rawest. “Black Weirdo” hinges on his stated inability to get with the “grown & sexy” thing because he doesn't want a caesar cut and can't stand 90s R&B (aside from Jodeci, Aaron Hall and R. Kelly “'cause they some goons”). “Gadget Ho” cusses out women at the club who seem more interested in texting and taking cameraphone photos than listening to his come-ons. And “The Fox Hunt"", a back-and-forth session with Juggaknots member Breeze Brewin, is an exercise in lowered expectations-- going for “ugly chicks” to cut down on relationship drama-- that gets to the old “it's what's inside that counts” truism as irreverently as possible. If that all sounds immature as hell at best and troublesome at worst, it's also tied in to a bigger theme at the album's real heart. The Peter Pan Syndrome is an examination of the midlife crisis of an artist who realizes he's not cut out for the 9-to-5 life, or much of anything else that the American Dream expects of him. J-Zone's aggravated flow and stand-up-ready delivery lends itself to some sharp observations on class struggle, gentrification, and the travails of thwarted upward mobility. “Trespasser” calls out Midwestern transplants who displace Brooklyn beef patty restaurants and give neighborhoods new euphemistic names to avoid the scary connotations of Bushwick or “Do-or-Die Bed-Stuy,” damning these newcomers not simply because they're quirky hipster cliches but because they're assholes who won't nod to the trash collector or let kids pet their Cosby-sweatered dog. Philly indie luminary Has-Lo joins up on “An Honest Day's Robbery,” where the dead-end lack of job prospects has them resorting to the desperate measure of engineering a “slip and fall” insurance scam at a Whole Foods. And there's an obvious but much-needed observation in “Jackin' for Basquiats” that J-Zone trades with his Lord Quas-esque rodent-voice sidekick Chief Chinchilla: How'd rappers turn paintings into status symbols when their $50 million price tags never go back to the cash-strapped arts community? That feeling of broke-but-fuck-it itchiness, that fine blend of frustration and defiant creation, shines through in J-Zone's production as well. Keeping in mind that a lot of the hip-hop he grew up with and reveres came about through technical limitations, mistakes, and low budgets, he kept his studio Roger Corman thrifty and leaned heavily on equipment that got a bit janky with age and neglect. After being run through an MPC 2000 with ten busted pads and a couple four-tracks, his beats sound 1995 in ways Tumblr rappers born that year have been flailing to reproduce. It's a setup that only getting old and happy with being set in his ways can really justify, but its layered, painstakingly battered into shape compositions never fail to claim that boom-bap revivalist sweet spot, especially with J-Zone's own chopped-up live drumkit breaks as part of the equation. (He even offers a few bars of uninterrupted solo playing for break purposes at the end of “Hog Slop”: “you can sample 'em, just gimme some credit, a'ight?”) There's approximately zero reason not to get this if you like Pimps Don't Pay Taxes-- it's that same perspective, larger than life without living large, marinated in a dozen years worth of life lessons. There's a dividing line that runs through it where it could be either the triumph of ageless unfiltered spirit, or the kind of extended middle finger to propriety that has you reaching for the word “manchild."" That it exhibits both of these sides and does its damnedest to reconcile them-- from the dirty-joke crash-pad lament “Crib Issues” to the soul-searching monologue of “Rap Baby Boomers”-- makes Peter Pan Syndrome a compelling listen, even through the jokey moments. Sure, J-Zone hasn't changed a lot stylistically since he hit that first peak back in 2001-- but that's kind of the point. And it's a point well made.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18516-j-zone-peter-pan-syndrome/,Old Maid,2013.0,"It's not often that you come across an album that is simultaneously fun and socially conscious, but that's exactly what J-Zone's 'Peter Pan Syndrome' delivers. The rapper, producer, and multi-instrumentalist has been active in the underground hip-hop scene since the late 90s, and his experience and skill shines through on this album.

Right from the opening track ""Peter Pan Syndrome,"" J-Zone sets the tone with his signature humor and unapologetic self-awareness. He knows that he's not getting any younger, but he's also not quite ready to grow up just yet. This theme runs throughout the album, with tracks like ""Time for a Crime Wave"" and ""Funky"" exploring the joys and challenges of resisting adulthood.

But don't be fooled into thinking that this album is all light-hearted fun. J-Zone has always been a socially conscious artist, and 'Peter Pan Syndrome' is no exception. On tracks like ""I Smell Smoke"" and ""Funky,"" he addresses issues like police brutality and the ghettos that many people are forced to live in. His lyrics are incisive, often using humor and wordplay to make his points in a memorable way.

What really sets this album apart, though, is the music itself. J-Zone is a talented producer, and he's clearly put a lot of thought into the sounds and textures on this album. There's a lot of variety here, from the old-school boom-bap of ""Funky"" to the groovy funk of ""Time for a Crime Wave."" J-Zone also makes use of live instruments throughout, adding a human touch to the beats.

Personally, I found this album to be a breath of fresh air in a world where so much hip-hop is dominated by materialism and posturing. J-Zone is a true original, with a unique perspective and a sound that is distinctly his own. And while not every track on 'Peter Pan Syndrome' is a standout, there's enough here to keep any fan of underground rap satisfied. Overall, I'd give this album a solid 7.5 out of 10.","1.

Major Lazer,Peace Is the Mission,"Global,Pop/R&B",7.4,June 3 2015,Claire Lobenfeld,Contributor,"Major Lazer's image has always been a bit slippery. Having gone through a number of member and affiliate changes since UK producer Switch—one half of the founding production team, along with Diplo—jumped ship in 2011, their ever-evolving mission has been confusing, sloppy, and not entirely easy to nail down. Their debut album Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do was a singular artifact of Diplo's fascination with global dance music, for lack of a better catchall, for which he is often called out as an appropriator. Despite the fact that he and Switch worked on the album in Kingston and recruited dancehall bona fides for every track, from icons like Vybz Kartel and Mr. Vegas to up-and-comers like Brooklyn bashment luminary Ricky Blaze, it was still sticky with an undercurrent of tourism. But with all of the pitfalls Major Lazer has faced since its inception—solo Diplo's hypeman Skerrit Bwoy's departure for religious pursuits; mismatched guests like Dirty Projectors' Amber Coffman and Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend for sophomore album Free the Universe—Peace Is the Mission finds the group finally emerging from their cocoon. What helped to pierce them out of a murky, genre-blurring funk, it turns out, was the confidence (and perhaps the notoriety and resources) to cash in and go full pop. Even though Diplo already had work with major pop stars on his CV (namely, Beyoncé's ""Pon De Floor""-sampling ""Run the World (Girls)"" and on Madonna's recent Rebel Heart), it was Major Lazer's inclusion on the Lorde-curated soundtrack for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 that truly marked this sea change. Their contribution, ""All My Love"" featuring Ariana Grande, maintained their penchant for dancehall-inflected festival dubstep and worked in a winky interpolation of ""Lollipop (Candyman)"" by Aqua (yes, the ""Barbie Girl"" group), all with a much slicker sheen. The song could have been just another paycheck, a chance to go for polish on a non-album project while staying esoteric with their own work, but lead single ""Lean On"", a collaboration with Danish upstart MØ and DJ Snake of ""Turn Down for What"" fame, indicated that they were sticking to this new refinement. These tracks also illustrate what Major Lazer excel at: crafting intricate, innovative EDM for honey-voiced singers that pushes boundaries people like David Guetta and Calvin Harris seemingly refuse to touch. Album opener ""Be Together"" with Chicago sibling duo Wild Belle combines breathless yearning and skittering percussion in a way that sounds new, while the warbled soul of ""Powerful"", featuring vocals from Ellie Goulding and reggae artist Tarrus Riley, swoons in a way we don't expect from the production trio. With his performance, stripped of patois and giving every Top 40 pretty boy a run for his money, Riley offers the album's best example of Major Lazer's ability to synthesize their influences. Where the previous two full-lengths tried to mesh opposing forces, here, they are finessed into no-nonsense stadium rattlers. Riley can master an EDM power-ballad, while the menace of a rapper like Pusha T meets its match with dancehall vet Mad Cobra on ""Night Riders"". Even a refreshed ""All My Love"" benefits from additional vocals from soca singer Machel Montano. ""Lean On"" and ""Powerful"" will likely end up the big hits of Peace, but tracks like ""Too Original"" with Jovi Rockwell and Swedish singer Elliphant, ""Light It Up"" featuring a guest appearance from R&B-reggae duo Brick and Lace's Nyla, and Chronixx-featuring ""Blaze Up the Fire"" also show a group locating its footing. They accomplish the, well, mission the group has trained its sights on since its genesis—and it's because they've linked with artists who also deal in fusion. They're not forcing it. There is no doubt Peace Is the Mission will suffer some criticism from dancehall purists, those exhausted by EDM and people who hate Diplo (a hate that he has certainly worked overtime to earn), but their maturation is palpable across the album's nine tracks. In the process, they've made a great pop record through uniting some of the globe's most exciting and celebrated pop artists.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20519-peace-is-the-mission/,Mad Decent,2015.0,"Peace Is the Mission Review: Major Lazer Delivers a Global and Catchy Album

Palehound,A Place I’ll Always Go,Rock,7.3,June 23 2017,Jillian Mapes,Senior Editor,"Imagine you have gone weeks eating TV dinners and suddenly you find yourself in the grocery store’s produce section. You handle the apples and peaches simply because you have forgotten what fruit feels like. The aisles are well lit and bursting with life, but still your mind turns to the loved one you’ve recently lost, then to all the emotional baggage attached. Scenes like these, with a tactile rush of vulnerability, are what Palehound’s leader and songwriter Ellen Kempner does best. You can feel the moment she describes because her songwriting is all about feel. And this grocery-aisle epiphany—as heard on her new record‘s best song, “Feeling Fruit”—is marked by Kempner’s sweetly picked guitar, which seems to rot from the inside. As she hums and whispers to herself, the mounting musical tension slowly boils off. It’s a tiny crushing sadness rendered in technicolor, suspended for what seems like forever in a song that’s only two and half minutes long. The 23-year-old Boston rocker’s sophomore LP is ripe with loss. In one of the record’s other memorable scenes, found on “If You Met Her,” Kempner recalls a moment she shared with a young friend who died suddenly, arguing at a Dunkin Donuts while eating blueberry glazed pastries. Delivered over an infectious jangle and cheerily unflinching beat, the song has a bittersweet ache. Kempner tries to make sense of it all and comes to few conclusions, other than knowing her friend would love her new girlfriend. For all the grief here, there’s also light. While Kempner was mourning her loved ones, she also happened to fall in love for the first time and fully embraced her queerness. This struggle between moving forward and being tugged back, by actual memories and by the muscle-memory of anxiety, is central to A Place I’ll Always Go, giving it more of a thematic center than her 2015 debut, Dry Food. Kempner’s project has matured in more ways than one as she’s bubbled up through Boston’s DIY scene. Dry Food was lo-fi and grungy, like it had a little dirt under its fingernails (in a great way); A Place I’ll Always Go is cleaner, the guitar crunch glinting and the production having room to twirl. There are echoes of earlier bands, with songs that brings to mind Smith Westerns (“Turning 21”), Beach House (“At Night I’m Alright With You”), the Strokes (“Flowing Over”), or Wilco (“Room”). But Palehound have always sounded like variations on classic indie rock, arranged around Kempner’s unique whisper of a voice and way of seeing the world that draws out the moodiness. This undercurrent distinguishes the project, and makes Kempner worth following. There is a lot of music about anxiety in the air these days, but Ellen Kempner’s voice is specific and visceral. It's the work of someone who can't hold it in, an emotion she captures quite well on “Flowing Over.” Lucky for us, her nervous, oversized heart knows not to tell, but instead show.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/a-place-ill-always-go/,Polyvinyl,2017.0,"Palehound's 'A Place I'll Always Go' is a haunting and poignant rock album that left me with a sense of longing and a feeling of incredible emotional depth. While it might not be the most groundbreaking album of the year, Palehound's musical ability and complex lyrics make for a rewarding and cathartic listening experience.

For those unfamiliar with the band, Palehound is the brainchild of singer/songwriter Ellen Kempner. Based in Boston, Massachusetts, the band formed in 2014 after Kempner dropped out of school and started playing gigs around town. Their first album, 'Dry Food', was released in 2015 to critical acclaim, and the band has since been a mainstay in the indie rock scene.

'A Place I'll Always Go', released in 2017, is the band's third album and is widely regarded as their most mature and ambitious work to date. The album deals with themes of grief, loss, and the difficulties of coming to terms with tragedy. The album's creation story is deeply personal - Kempner wrote many of the songs while processing the loss of a close friend.

The album opens with 'Hunter's Gun', a slow-burning ballad that sets the tone for the rest of the album. Kempner's voice is raw and emotive, and the instrumentation is understated, allowing the lyrics to take center stage. 'Turning 21' is another standout track, with its upbeat melody and relatable lyrics about growing older and feeling lost.

Throughout the album, Kempner's lyrics are brutally honest yet never self-indulgent. On 'If You Met Her', she sings about the pain of losing a friend to addiction, and on 'At Night I'm Alright With You', she explores the complexities of the grieving process. Every song on the album feels like a window into Kempner's soul, and it's impossible not to be moved by her vulnerability.

There are moments on the album where the instrumentation feels too sparse, and I found myself yearning for a bigger sound. However, this is a minor quibble, and the album's acoustic feel ultimately adds to its intimacy and emotional impact.

Overall, 'A Place I'll Always Go' is an impressive and affecting album that showcases Palehound's musical and lyrical prowess. It's a testament to the healing power of music and serves as a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there's always beauty and hope to be found.","1.

Dengue Fever,Venus on Earth,Rock,4.0,March 21 2008,Mike Powell,Contributor,"The task of presenting Dengue Fever-- an L.A.-area garage band with a Cambodian female singer-- would be a cakewalk for even the clumsiest marketers. Their novelty is clear, present, and safe; their assortment of 1960s minutiae-- from strange Cambodian translations of U.S. and UK psych-rock to spy movie soundtracks to surf-- is charmingly jumbled and affable. Every element shiny and signifying, straightforward and appealing. And yet their style creates a little dissonance in me. Celebrating Cambodian garage rock-- a music whose practitioners were systematically executed by the Khmer Rouge in the late 70s-- is an odd thing to do without historicizing it, especially when the history deserves so much sober attention. But my frustrations with them aren't conceptual, they're practical. Vocalist Chhom Nimol has an elevatory, radiant voice that would overshadow pretty much any band she might be in. In the case of Dengue Fever, that's a special blessing. Even when their songs pass muster, the performances feel ineffectual, which makes long stretches of Venus on Earth drag semi-miserably. Even the styles they so dutifully ape had an imagination about what to do with the aural character of their guitars, whether through distortion, other effects, or a particular production style. Dengue Fever's textures are straight out of the box, as if what they thought what they're doing between the bars is novel enough. Sometimes it is. Usually, it's not. While Chhom used to sing almost exclusively in Khmer, almost half of Venus on Earth is in English. There's such a thing as subpar lyrics that don't distract from the gestalt of a band's sound, but Dengue Fever don't find the balance. Instead, narratives about the strains of cross-continental love (""Tiger Phone Card"") or the distinctly Southern Californian pain of having to pick up your drunk girlfriend from parties across town (""Sober Driver"") tend to act more as a compounding element for than a distraction from the band's distinctly okay music. Gone are the few dazzling mutts that skulked through 2005's Escape from Dragon House (particularly ""Sui Bong"" and ""One Thousand Tears of a Tarantula""); here are 11 well-forged set pieces that don't really add up to great songs. I feel anal-retentive and self-loathing saying that I want to like Dengue Fever, but it's true: I appreciate that they're making indie rock music informed by a foreign stylistic context, I appreciate the mix of non-Western music with Western, and I love Chhom's voice. But there are better ""foreign"" bands, and musicians making more interesting mixes at the moment-- M.I.A., Tinariwen, and even some of Ricardo Villalobos' recent singles sound like they could be from more than one different place, and I mean that as a compliment. While Dengue Fever's intentions are good, their expressions verge on vacuous. Venus on Earth is the kind of benign aural tourism that always made me a little bored and suspicious of Air and even, occasionally, of Stereolab. But what those bands might've lacked in sincerity (if that's what you could call it), they covered for with diligence of craft. I'm generally up for pledging to lightness of mind and the revelations of exoticism, but if Venus on Earth is their idea of, well, Venus on Earth, I'll stick with Earth as is.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11241-venus-on-earth/,M80 Music,2008.0,"If you're a music fanatic who's always on the lookout for something new and unusual, then you need to listen to ""Venus on Earth"" by the LA-based band Dengue Fever. Known for blending Cambodian pop music with garage rock, they have definitely earned a reputation for being one of the most innovative bands in the music industry. And this album is no exception.

But before I dive into the tracks on this album, let's take a quick trip down memory lane to see how Dengue Fever came about. The band's roots can be traced back to Karaoke bars in the Cambodian-American community in Long Beach, California. It was at one of these bars where guitarist Zac Holtzman met Cambodian singer Chhom Nimol. He was immediately blown away by her voice and the two of them formed the band in 2001.

Over the years, Dengue Fever has released several albums that showcase their signature blend of Cambodian pop music, psychedelic rock, and garage rock. But ""Venus on Earth"" remains their most celebrated and acclaimed work yet. It's not hard to see why.

The album starts off with ""Seeing Hands,"" which is a great introduction to the band's sound. Nimol's soaring vocals paired with the thrashing guitars and funky bass line sets the tone for the rest of the album. The second track, ""Clipped Wings,"" is a personal favorite of mine. The dreamy melody combined with Nimol's languid vocals make it a standout song on the album.

One of the things I love about ""Venus on Earth"" is the way each track features a different combination of instruments. On ""Tiger Phone Card,"" for instance, the saxophone takes center stage and complements Nimol's vocals beautifully. Meanwhile, ""Oceans of Venus"" has a great bass line that serves as the backbone of the song.

As someone who loves rock music, I appreciate how Dengue Fever has come up with such a unique and refreshing take on the genre. That being said, I can see how some might not be immediately drawn to their sound. It's definitely an acquired taste. The rating of 4.0 out of 10 is a bit harsh, in my opinion. I would give this album at least an 8.0 out of 10. 

Overall, I highly recommend giving ""Venus on Earth"" a listen. It's an impressive work of art that showcases the band's incredible musicianship and ability to blend genres seamlessly. If you're looking for music that's outside the box but still rocks hard, then look no further than Dengue Fever.","1.

Schoolboy Q,Blank Face LP,Rap,8.3,July 14 2016,Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,"“Music-wise right now, I suck.” In 2014, Schoolboy Q bluntly described his difficulty staying off lean, and what the drug had done to his art and personal life. He told radio personality Angie Martinez that he’d managed to keep it at arms’-length while recording his major label debut, Oxymoron, but that as soon as the album was done, he’d had something of a relapse. Listening to the album though, you suspected that Q may have been dabbling before the record was mixed. Lean leads to bloat, and while Oxymoron featured plenty of memorable moments, it had too much empty material to fully capitalize on the promise of the rapper’s snarling sophomore album, Habits & Contradictions**. Q’s enormous personality had been downsized, his sharp edges smoothed, his straight-talking iconoclasm receding into rote gangsterisms. So while Oxymoron was received positively upon release, enthusiasm soon dwindled for the record and for the rapper once thought by many to be the slyer, less-earnest equal of his TDE labelmate Kendrick Lamar. Two years later, Quincy Matthew Hanley says he’s no longer addicted. He’s lost 30 pounds and with his second album for Interscope, Blank Face, he’s returned to the trajectory that had him looking like the yin to Kendrick’s yang. Q’s unpredictable flow, as likely to morph into a bizarrely appealing sing-song melody as it is to shift to sneering double-time, has returned. With it comes a collection of catchy, urgent gangster rap songs that show the South Central native at his charismatic best, gallows humor and tough talk failing to obscure a humane core. The new record is loaded with features, a warning sign of scattershot focus on most major label albums. But Q’s voice holds the center of nearly every track on Blank Face. Anderson .Paak, rap’s scene stealer of the year to date, is compelling as ever on the album’s title track, but it’s Quincy who grounds the narrative, his spoken-word verses painting a past on Hoover Street and a future with the daughter he refers to as both a munchkin and a queen. Kanye West and Vince Staples, two of the biggest personalities in hip-hop, trade bars with Q without overshadowing him, and the songs on which they’re featured, “That Part” and “Ride Out,” are standouts that nonetheless fit seamlessly into the course of the record as a whole. (Miguel is the only exception to the rule of polite guests: His smooth hook and Q’s sandpaper verses repel each other on the late-album misfire, “Overtime.”) We’re accustomed to seeing concept albums from TDE, but Blank Face strays from the polemic, reaching instead for portraiture. Q’s verses are built from concrete details and raw emotion, and his flexibility is such that he’s able to channel two seemingly conflicting emotions into a single verse. His bitterness will be palpable, one moment; in the next, pride shines through. “Guess I’m being a real n**** like I’m ‘pposed to be,” he raps on “Lord Have Mercy. “But being real never once brought the groceries.” Then, in the span of a couple bars: “Hope was all that I needed/dreaming myself to work. The working affair was better than bullet holes in my shirt.” Tracks like “Groovy Tony/Eddie Kane,” which was produced in part by TDE producer and frequent Q collaborator, Tae Beast, signal a return to the collective’s house sound. Blank Face turns away from the ambitious fusion of To Pimp a Butterfly**, instead doubling down on a smoked-out atmosphere that points the listener’s focus toward rapping. That puts the onus on Q to hold attention for the duration of the record’s hour-plus running time, and he does so with a wide array of tricks, lacing his bars with tone and tempo shifts, a melodicism reminiscent of a young 50 Cent, and ad-libs worthy of Jadakiss, whose signature growling delivery and descriptions of Tony Soprano-esque nihilism provide a thrill on the back half of the track (the first part of which was released as a single without Jada in April.”) Schoolboy Q’s resemblance to those stars—both of whom flamed out to some degree as the commercial and creative center shifted away from gangster rap—is natural. Unlike Drake, or Future and Young Thug, Q’s music doesn’t represent a definitive break with the past. Instead, he symbolizes something of a road not taken, a gangster rapper with the personality and pop instincts to translate an antiquated genre for younger listeners, something like YG’s work with DJ Mustard. Q’s early hits, “Hands on the Wheel” and “There He Go,” were classic rap songs with pop appeal, and Q continues to ably tread that tightrope on Blank Face, with tracks like the E-40 feature “Dope Dealer” and “Whateva U Want,” which somehow makes a trance beat work. But it’s Q’s reemergence as a distinctive voice that makes Blank Face so welcome. Quincy isn’t the preaching type, but he’s a careful observer both of his own tendencies and those of the world he occupies. Bluster and braggadocio are traditions in rap, but while Q spews plenty of both, he also has a penchant for telling it like it is. In our current political moment, that makes some of the songs on Blank Face particularly unforgettable. “Black Thoughts” features some of the most moving production from TDE familiar Willie B, as Schoolboy Q raps the blues: “Ole gangsta crip, my papa was a bitch/ left me while hope just don’t exist.” It’s one of many points on the record where Q casts something like a documentary eye on his own surroundings. In the early morning on July 7th, Q tweeted out four bars from “Neva Change,” the blistering centerpiece of Blank Face: “You see them lights get behind us/They pull me out for my priors/Won’t let me freeze ‘fore they fire/You say that footage a liar.” The song was most likely recorded months prior. But hours after Philando Castile was fatally shot by a police officer while reaching for his license and the aftermath of the encounter was watched by millions, the rapper’s words were more timely than most reporting.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22094-blank-face-lp/,"Interscope,Top Dawg",2016.0,"Hey there music lovers! Today, I want to talk to you about the highly-anticipated album, 'Blank Face LP' by Schoolboy Q. As a fan of the rapper's music, I was excited to hear what he had in store for us this time, and I was not disappointed.

For those of you unfamiliar with Schoolboy Q, let me give you a brief background. He is a Los Angeles-born rapper who gained recognition with his debut album 'Setbacks' in 2011. He has since released several successful albums, collaborated with some big names in the industry and has won multiple awards including BET and Grammy nominations.

Now, onto 'Blank Face LP.' This album is, without a doubt, Schoolboy Q's most personal work yet, delving into sensitive topics such as loss and addiction. The 17-track album was created over a span of two years, during which Schoolboy Q went through personal hardships that gave him ample inspiration to create such a masterpiece.

From the opening track ""TorcH,"" one can already sense the dark and sombre tone that lingers throughout the album. The production on this album is top-notch, with beats that perfectly complement Schoolboy Q's distinctive flow. Each track seamlessly transitions into the next, creating a seamless and cohesive experience for the listener.

The album's standout tracks, however, are ""THat Part"" and ""By Any Means."" ""THat Part"" features a memorable verse from Kanye West and has a catchy chorus that is guaranteed to get stuck in your head. ""By Any Means"" is a slow-burning track that showcases Schoolboy Q's lyrical prowess and raw emotions.

As someone who had previously enjoyed Schoolboy Q's music, 'Blank Face LP' truly exceeded my expectations. The rapper's vulnerable and introspective lyrics, combined with the top-tier production, make this album a must-listen for any rap fan.

Overall, I would give it an 8.3 out of 10 rating. While it may not be a perfect album, it is certainly one that will stay with listeners long after they have finished it.

Boards of Canada,Tomorrow's Harvest,Electronic,8.3,June 10 2013,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Sounds like Boards of Canada. In the early years of this century, you heard many electronic music aficionados using that phrase, usually in the context of an endorsement. The Scottish brothers Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin didn’t invent a new sound, but they did take various strands of music floating around and pull them into one place and essentially perfect them. And their particular fusion was so distinctive that their name became shorthand. The appetite for the BoC was so voracious that the group’s actual output, which was actually fairly prolific in its first decade, wasn’t nearly enough to satisfy it. But that was a long time ago. Since 2006 we’ve heard a lot of music that seems spiritually connected to Boards of Canada, from Burial to chillwave, but we haven’t heard a note of music from the originators until the surprise announcement of Tomorrow’s Harvest. While BoC have always seemed comfortable inside their core sound, their records are still easy to distinguish. On Music Has the Right to Children, they mixed creepy pre-erased drones with childhood nostalgia and drums that drew from hip-hop; on 2002’s Geogaddi, the beats got harder and the unease grew more intense, resulting in an album that was still playful but far darker. Campfire Headphase, from 2005, brought acoustic guitars to the table and aimed for a more pastoral feel, but it lacked the tension of what came before. And Tomorrow’s Harvest is in some ways the flipside to Campfire, the bucolic tint swapped out for moody drones and encroaching dread. It is the most internally focused of Boards of Canada’s records. Rather than working around the edges of their sound in search of new territory, Tomorrow’s Harvest finds them drawing back toward the center. Given its hermetic feel, it makes sense BoC have indicated that soundtracks were an especially big influence. They specifically invoke the work of John Carpenter, Mark Isham, and Wendy Carlos, all of whom constructed some of their most enduring scores in the late 1970s and early 80s. That was a period where analog synthesis was reaching full maturity but digital synthesis was in its earlier stages, when the tape-driven Mellotron competed for studio space with the digital Fairlight and new timbres were being explored. If the earliest Boards of Canada music still seemed inspired by Warp’s post-techno Artificial Intelligence movement, beats on Tomorrow's Harvest are secondary. The tempos are generally slow, and there’s not much trickiness to the percussion. The tracks tend to create a groove and stick with it for the duration. The creative energy here is directed toward building textures, which are very deep and rich indeed. The most visceral sound design in Boards of Canada’s music has tended to occur during their short interludes, but here they’ve taken some those ideas and explored them at length, filling the tracks with details that can take some time to soak in. On headphones, you can explore the tracks one motif at a time, as if each were a small landscape. “Jacquard Causeway” has a series of metallic-sounding twinkles that seems to grow out of the chords that swell underneath, and they slip in and out of phase with the underlying drums in a manner that imparts an extra measure of uneasiness. “Split Your Infinities” has bird sounds and distant noises that sound like lasers, both of which are so subtle so as to function subliminally. “Nothing Is Real” is a swirl of deep bass, stop-start drums, and a continual surging synth line that sounds like a swarm of bugs, but it also has a distant, echoing keyboard line that haunts the track like a ghost. The layering of the various sounds on a given track offers a different way in each time, so they can take on an M.C. Escher-like quality, where the tone and emotional content varies according to what you choose to pay attention to. There are sounds behind sounds and sounds underneath sounds and you can find yourself sifting through the layers, turning the pieces inside-out. If Boards of Canada’s sound construction has reached a new plateau, they do seem to have left some appealing elements of their earlier approach behind. Returning again to Music or Geogaddi, it’s striking how tuneful those records were. Whether they’ve lost that ability or no longer choose to incorporate it, melody is not the focus on Tomorrow’s Harvest. These tracks unfurl, grow, and shrink, but they don’t exactly develop, at least not in the same way. The early playfulness, too, is no longer part of the equation. It’s easy to forget about “childlike” for Boards of Canada at one point didn’t just mean the ache of nostalgia or the fear of nightmares but actually pleasurable activities like clapping hands and laughing and saying funny words. And the lightness and humor-- the repetition of the word “Orange” in ""Aquarius"", say-- are something they don’t seem remotely interested in here. It’s not hard to imagine a certain kind of Boards of Canada fan missing that variety. So that’s what is not here. What we’re left with is Boards of Canada’s moodiest record, a full-length tinted with atmosphere that unfolds slowly and is happy to allow you to come to it. Creating a new way to hear electronic music, as they did in the first half of their career, earned them that right to make a record that is absorbed through osmosis. And true to its patient nature and long gestation period, Tomorrow’s Harvest’s last third is its best. As they move from the ultra-simple, Music for Films-like “Sundown” through the soot-dusted “New Seeds”, with its quiet guitar grind and bell-like percussion, and then on through the arpeggiated Tangerine Dream-style “Come to Dust” and the the closing bass-pedals of “Semena Mertvykh”, it’s clear that they still, after all this time and all the imitators, own this world. And it’s nice to hear that they’re still inhabiting it.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18104-boards-of-canada-tomorrows-harvest/,Warp,2013.0,"Boards of Canada's music has always been somewhat of an enigma to me. With a sound that's both otherworldly and nostalgic, they've managed to pioneer their own brand of electronic music that's stood the test of time. So, when I got my hands on their 2013 release ""Tomorrow's Harvest,"" I was more than excited to see what they had in store.

For those of you who might not be familiar with the band, Boards of Canada are a Scottish duo consisting of Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin. They've been active since the mid-90s and have long been associated with the Warp Records label. Over the years, they've crafted a sound that's equal parts analogue and digital, blending field recordings, found sounds, and vintage synths to create something wholly unique.

""Tomorrow's Harvest"" was the band's fourth full-length album and their first release in eight years. According to the duo, the record was inspired by dystopian science fiction, which can definitely be heard in the bleak and foreboding soundscapes that they've crafted. What's interesting about this album, though, is how it manages to balance this sense of despair with moments of hope and optimism.

From the opening track, ""Gemini"", it's clear that the band has poured a lot of thought and emotion into this album. The track features a looping piano melody that's both somber and uplifting, setting the tone for what's to come. ""Sick Times,"" on the other hand, is a track that's almost claustrophobic in its sound. With distorted drums and a wall of synths, it's a track that immerses you in the harshness of the world that Boards of Canada are describing.

One of my personal favorite tracks on the album is ""Jacquard Causeway."" With its blend of organic and synthetic sounds, it's a track that feels both futuristic and nostalgic. The melody is catchy, but also slightly dissonant, creating a sense of unease that's hard to shake.

Overall, ""Tomorrow's Harvest"" is an album that's equal parts challenging and rewarding. Boards of Canada has always been a band that's unafraid to take risks and push boundaries, and this album is no exception. It's a record that's both haunting and beautiful, and one that showcases just how talented these two musicians really are. If you're a fan of electronic music that's not afraid to experiment and evolve, then you need to give this album a listen.

Peaches,Fatherfucker,Electronic,3.5,October 29 2003,Matt LeMay,Contributor,"There are plenty of perfectly good ways to say ""I don't give a fuck."" Unfortunately, screaming ""I don't give a fuck"" at the top of your lungs over and over again isn't one of them. It's hard to imagine anything sadder than someone expending such a huge amount of energy trying to prove that, no, really, she doesn't give a fuck-- except, of course, for this desperate plea for attention being followed by the very apathy and disaffection it promises. Such is the case with Peaches' intensely disappointing second album Fatherfucker, which couples gratuitously ""shocking"" and embarrassingly unfunny lyrics with flat, lackluster instrumentation. For all its sexed-up bravado, Peaches' debut, last year's The Teaches of Peaches, was in a class of its own, if nothing else: something about the way she approached her subject matter with such hilarious juvenility and unabashed, joyful conviction, while going to all possible extremes to make herself appear as unapproachably hideous as possible, struck me as irresistible. Right from its frank opening line, ""Sucking on my titties,"" the album lived up to its name, providing a urgently needed collection of dirty schoolyard ditties for the immature and oversexed electroclash set. One of its best attributes was its ability to leave you wondering whether Peaches took any of it seriously: was she actually promoting a lifestyle of canned drum machine beats and empty, gratuitous sex, or sending it up so masterfully that her songs could be embraced by the very people she mocked? Either way, the joke's on Peaches here. When Fatherfucker opens with ""I Don't Give a Fuck"", in which a sample of Joan Jett's ""Bad Reputation"" is answered, over the course of nearly two minutes, with a painfully drawn-out tantrum: ""I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Fuck!"" Yet, as outright terrible as this track is, Fatherfucker's general mediocrity and sterility proves even more frustrating. The gritty, overdriven 808 beats of Teaches were one of its greatest assets-- a welcome respite from the glossy, platonic ideal percussion tracks employed by so many electroclash artists. The beats on Fatherfucker are not only frustratingly simplistic, but the energy and surprising rhythmic complexity of the vocals on her debut are noticeably absent, too. Songs like ""I U She"" and ""I'm the Kinda"" consist of little more than minimal and repetitive lyrics delivered dispassionately over cookie-cutter drum machine beats. Whether she's singing about bitches, fucking, clits, threesomes, or porkbelly futures doesn't really matter; after a few songs, you, like Peaches, don't give a fuck-- and you don't have to fuck up a Joan Jett record to prove it. Nor do you have to indulge in a miserable, stupidly self-referential duet with Iggy Pop. In ""Tear It Up"", Iggy and Peaches throw back and forth snippets of each other's lyrics and references to their respective schticks. ""I used to cut myself up!"" says Iggy. ""Some people don't like my crotch!"" says Peaches. ""Hey, guys, shut the fuck up!"" says the imaginary singer I hallucinated out of boredom, offering up a lyric far too honest and straightforward to have been worked into the original song. Lame duets aside, there remain a lot of things I really like about Peaches. With all the press coverage she's been receiving as of late, she continues to willfully defy all conventional notions of attractiveness in the way she chooses to be photographed, and her live shows remain entertaining, despite weaker source material. Yes, Fatherfucker is a disaster, but it's a disaster that reveals just how unlikely its still-excellent predecessor was. Here, the swollen charisma and balls-out energy of Teaches is given up in favor of mediocre songs about swollen balls. Sorry, Peaches, but sometimes it pays to give a fuck.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6204-fatherfucker/,XL,2003.0,"When it comes to electronic music, few artists can match the audacity and unapologetic attitude of Peaches. Her 2003 album ""Fatherfucker"" is a prime example of her fearless approach to art and music.

Let's start with some context: Peaches is a Canadian musician and performance artist who burst onto the scene in the early 2000s with her unique blend of electroclash, punk, and feminist ideals. Her music is provocative, irreverent, and often NSFW – but always with a sense of humor and a clever twist. She's a queer icon and a voice for sexual liberation and gender equality.

Now, ""Fatherfucker."" The album's title alone is enough to turn some heads – but it's not just shock value for the sake of it. Peaches has said that the title is a reference to patriarchy and the idea of rebelling against the father figure. The album as a whole is a reflection of that theme, with lyrics that tackle gender roles, power dynamics, and sexual desire in a confrontational, sometimes unsettling way.

The production on ""Fatherfucker"" is a strange mix of lo-fi and high-tech, with distorted beats and synths that sound both futuristic and nostalgic. It's not an easy listening experience, and some of the tracks can feel abrasive or repetitive. But there are moments of pure brilliance as well, like the haunting ballad ""I U She"" or the fierce opener ""I Don't Give A…""

As for personal experience, I have to admit that I'm not a die-hard Peaches fan. I remember hearing some of her songs back in the day and feeling intrigued but also a bit weirded out. Listening to ""Fatherfucker"" now, I can appreciate the boldness and creativity that went into it – but it's not an album I would choose to play on repeat. It's too intense and confrontational for my taste, and I find myself wanting more variety in the sound and the lyrics.

Overall, I would give ""Fatherfucker"" a 5 out of 10. It's worth checking out if you're a Peaches fan or if you're interested in exploring the wilder side of electronic music. But if you're looking for something easy to listen to or uplifting, this is not the album for you.","1.

Uh, make it, uh... one. One, two, one, two, three..."" -- Brian Wilson, 1966, during the recording of Smile This is always how it ends up for perfectionist geniuses. While modern day recording techniques have cleaned up a lot of the extraneous human element, and actual error on tape has gone the way of the dodo, there can never really be a final, best take of music for people like Brian Wilson. The good part about this is that listeners are treated to ever-expanding and evolving displays of inspired performance. When you follow the lineage of Beach Boys albums up to Smile, Brian's progress as a musician, songwriter and producer is so clear as to verge on distraction. In fact, he was so good that his fans took it for granted that with every new album, new frontiers would be broached. When Smile fell by the wayside, and we were left to make sense of the remaining pieces (Brian coped by writing songs about writing directions), all that hard work seemed somehow for naught. This is the bad part: chiefly, when you expect great things, good things disappoint. Neutral Milk Hotel leader/only-permanent-member Jeff Mangum has more than a little Brian in him. Musically, it seems he's quite familiar with those Smile sessions, particularly in the way he can take an ounce of pretension and turn it into all manner of a kitchen sink melodrama. And it's not just the productions themselves, but also the idiosyncrasy at work, as if personal vision somehow became a method of existence rather than a character quirk. For better or worse, a little Brian goes a long way, and in general, those afflicted (think Andy Partridge, not Sean O'Hagan) travel along similar paths: a tale of small beginnings, steady progress building to whatever masterpiece they were meant to produce, and then a sudden dimming like a dwarf star. Everything Is is a reissue of a three-song EP from 1995, with one additional song. Like Wilson's earliest work, it offers few clues as to what would come later, and is fairly innocuous on its own. However, it certainly supports the idea that Mangum has steadily progressed, at least conceptually. The title track is something like lo-fi glam folk, with a pinch of transience that only people who truly love pop can have. Unfortunately, what stood out first for me was that the singing sounded so disinterested, as if he was afraid to get too close to the microphone-- or possibly, that he simply hadn't found his voice yet. ""Snow Song, Pt. 1"" sounds even more lo-fi than the opener, mostly because of relentlessly out-of-tune guitars and Mangum's not-quite-in-synch, double-tracked vocals. From any early stage, he seems not to have been as concerned with songcraft and arrangement as weight and mood. Actually, these tunes seem to have more in common with Dennis Wilson than Brian, due primarily to the melancholy lead vocal and sincere (though verging on inept) accompaniment, but also to the almost funny surfer/hippie twang in Mangum's delivery. And then comes the obligatory (?) sound-collage piece, which I guess, given the Smile background, could make sense. There are snippets of conversation thrown in (and throughout the record), and though it reminds me of something psychedelic-- a Blue Meanies march, perhaps, or something from a fever dream-- I never figured Mangum as the LSD type. Perhaps it's just studio fun, or possibly the effects of living below sea level for so long. In any case, ""Tuesday Moon"" (not included on the previous version of this EP) wipes away most of the residue. Again, fairly light stuff, but pop is pop, and when you go down the Path Beaten by Brian, it's a prerequisite that you can write catchy tunes. Of course, we know what happened over the course of the next six years (and two very good albums), and in this light, Everything Is seems harmless. I couldn't recommend it to someone who had never heard Neutral Milk Hotel before without feeling a little guilty, but for fans who don't already know the whole story, it might serve as a nice prologue. Where I stray from my own advice is upon the realization that after 40+ years writing music, Brian Wilson has come full circle. His last album sounded good but the songwriting was a shell of his former craft. By that logic, Mangum's later stuff will be underachieving, poorly recorded fuzz-pop. Of course, it's probably not that simple, but if by some chance he has a nervous breakdown after obsessing over his next album, don't say I didn't warn you.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5759-everything-is-ep/,"Orange Twin,Orange Twin",1995.0,"Neutral Milk Hotel, a rock powerhouse from the late ‘90s, has returned to the music scene, this time with their new EP 'Everything Is.' As a longtime fan of the band, I was excited to dive into this new project and see what masterpieces they had in store for us. With a genre rating of 6.0 out of 10, I was hesitant but curious to see how they would approach this new venture.

For those unfamiliar with the band, Neutral Milk Hotel has a storied history. The group was formed in Ruston, Louisiana back in the early 1990s by lead singer Jeff Mangum. Neutral Milk Hotel's first album, “On Avery Island,” set the bar high for the band and established their unique sound.

Their follow-up album, ""In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,"" is widely regarded as a classic and it elevated the band to indie rock superstardom. However, after this release, the band went silent, leaving fans wondering if they would ever hear from them again.

Fast forward to 2021, and the band is back with their new EP 'Everything Is.' This project was created during the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw the band members separated in different locations. Despite these challenges, the band managed to put together five incredible tracks that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression.

At first listen, I felt that the sound was different from what I was used to hearing from the band. But after delving further into the album, I was pleasantly surprised by how the band experimented with their sound. The music was raw and vulnerable, creating an intimate experience for the listener.

The EP opens with ""The Bunny,"" a track that immediately caught my attention. The song features haunting vocals from Jeff Mangum that blend beautifully with the acoustic guitar. The opening track sets the tone of the album, with its haunting melody and honest lyrics. The rest of the tracks follow the same theme, with the band staying true to their indie rock roots.

One of the standout tracks on the EP is ""Up and Over."" This track has a more upbeat sound compared to the others, and it's easy to get caught up in the fast-paced rhythm. The track is a perfect example of the band's ability to experiment with their sound while staying true to their roots.

Overall, 'Everything Is' offers a fresh take on Neutral Milk Hotel's sound, and it's a welcome addition to their discography. While it may not be on the same level as some of their previous releases, it's clear that this EP was created with heart and passion. The raw, intimate sound of the EP is what makes it memorable and a must-listen for Neutral Milk Hotel fans and casual music enthusiasts alike.","1.

This album is a collection of live recordings from the British Broadcasting Corporation done between the years of 1965 and 1973. With a rating of 8.4 out of 10, this album is definitely not one to sleep on.

For those unfamiliar with The Who, they are a British rock band that formed in 1964. The band is made up of Roger Daltrey on vocals, Pete Townshend on guitar and backing vocals, John Entwistle on bass guitar and backing vocals, and Keith Moon on drums. The Who rose to fame in the 1960s and 70s with iconic songs such as ""My Generation"" and ""Pinball Wizard"".

'BBC Sessions' is a time capsule of The Who's early years. It includes early tracks such as ""Borish Johnson"" and ""Circles"". The album also includes live versions of their biggest hits, such as ""I Can't Explain"" and ""Substitute"". The tracks were recorded live at BBC studios, which adds to the authenticity of the music.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""My Generation"". The live version on this album is pure gold. The energy that emits from the performance is palpable, and the sheer rawness of the track is something that cannot be replicated. Daltrey's voice is as powerful as ever, and Townshend's guitar playing is simply unparalleled.

Another noteworthy track is ""A Quick One, While He's Away"". The Who's performance on this track is electric, and the song itself is a true masterpiece. The song is divided into several different parts, each with its own unique sound and energy. The way the band transitions between each part is flawless, and it is truly an impressive feat.

In addition to the remarkable musical prowess displayed on this album, the story of its creation is also worth mentioning. The album was initially released in 2000 in celebration of the band's 35th anniversary. The selection of tracks was curated by The Who's guitarist, Pete Townshend, and their longtime producer, Shel Talmy. The album was a commercial success and is still highly regarded among music critics to this day.

Speaking personally, The Who has always held a special place in my heart. Their music ignites a fire within me and their energy is infectious. 'BBC Sessions' is a fantastic addition to any music lover's collection, and it is a testament to the groundbreaking, influential band that is The Who.

In conclusion, 'BBC Sessions' is a must-listen for any rock fan. The album's historical significance and the band's exceptional musical talent make it a standout piece in The Who's impressive catalog. With its raw energy and fantastic tracklist, 'BBC Sessions' is a perfect representation of what makes The Who such a legendary band.

Craig Armstrong,As If to Nothing,"Electronic,Rock",2.2,July 17 2002,Paul Cooper,Contributor,"Best known for scoring film soundtracks, Craig Armstrong has provided a-list pop acts (U2, Massive Attack, and Spice Girls) with cloying string arrangements. But his stock-in-trade is moody, gargatuanly stringed incidental music for hysterically overblown movies like Moulin Rouge and Plunkett and MacLean. The appropriately titled As If to Nothing follows on from his 101-Strings-for-Jaded-Dullards debut, The Space Between Us, and repeats the same formula throughout its sixty-nine minutes, just as its predecessor did. Though some might say that Armstrong's music is powerfully evocative and serene, such people hate music and all its subtle possibilities and intricacies. Plus, if Armstrong perceives that music can be subtle, intricate and meaningful, this album goes strenuously out of its way to demonstrate the opposite. An Armstrong piece is short and unobtrusive, which, for movie producers, means Armstrong's an affordable alternative to James Horner or John Williams. While no director really wants an audience distracted by a heavenly orchestral piece from his or her images, I expect something more eventful for home listening than billows of strings interrupted in the politest way by French horns or a soaring oboe. Perhaps aware of the limitations of his instrumentals, Armstrong enlisted help: drum-n-bass master Photek, soul crooner David McAlmont, Alpha vocalist Wendy Stubbs, Antye Greie-Fuchs from German glitchers Laub, Bono, Mogwai and even Lemonheaded lost boy Evan Dando took time out from their otherwise productive lives to take part in this effete twaddle. Rumor has it that a small town was built to house and support all the musicians involved in realizing Armstrong's bland vision. Divided into two camps: hundreds of Musicians' Union schlubs, and those star performers the liners classify as ""featured artist."" But anyone wandering into Armstrong's shanty town could distinguish the two classes by whether they had a limo pick them up from their temporary accommodation or whether they had to ride Shank's pony to the studio. Once seated in front of the music stands, the majority of the performers probably chuckled at how childishly simple Armstrong's score is, and how repetitious. All string players are asked to play languidly and high, piling on mock emotion by the shovelful. Horn players are similarly asked to underpin the insipidly swollen string gestures with mannered blasts. Percussion is left to programmers, who borrow heavily from Massive Attack's Mezzanine loops. Any discerning listener must hope that the ""featured artists"" will crack through the sickly sweet monotony. The juxtaposition of sweeping strings and Mogwai could have been fascinating, had Mogwai's contribution not been erased in post-production. I can detect no trace of them during ""Miracle,"" the piece on which they're credited. Photek suffers identically. I'm at a loss to find Photek amid the generic trip-hop beats of ""Hymn 2,"" and the addition of soprano soloist Catherine Bott to the track makes it seem as though Armstrong constructed this song solely for those wishing to augment their Enya and Enigma collections. Despite Armstrong declaring in a Guardian newspaper interview that Antye Greie-Fuchs' band Laub are reminiscent of Stockhausen, he (maliciously?) reduces her vocals to exotic curiosity during ""Waltz."" Fuchs babbles away in German and occasionally English making no sense and leaving the majority of listeners with a very dim view of her mental health. Bono gets to redo his vocals for U2's chestnut, ""Stay (Faraway, So Close),"" and reveals that despite his striving for Scott Walker's baritone, the best he'll ever achieve is Michael Bolton's. David McAlmont, former Thieves vocalist and collaborator with ex-London Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, fairs far better, which really is damning him with faint praise. During ""Snow,"" McAlmont taps into the powerful soulful pathos that made songs like ""Yes"" (from The Sound of McAlmont and Butler) such stunners. But again, Armstrong bludgeons McAlmont with the orchestra, perhaps out of jealousy. McAlmont is capable of real emotion, not Armstrong's ersatz approximation of feeling. I find Armstrong's successful career bewildering, given the extremely narrow musical ability he displays throughout this album. A case in point is ""Starless II,"" a piece that incorporates a chunk of Robert Fripp's guitar solo from King Crimson's ""Starless."" The extent of Armstrong's ability is to mimic exactly the notes Fripp plays in the string section, which is a stultifying waste of everyone's time. The strings attach themselves like barnacles to Fripp's guitar and refuse to be shaken loose. Another instrumental, ""Ruthless Gravity,"" demonstrates just how conservative an electronic label Astralwerks can be. Token blips begin the song before a deluge of syrupy unison strings shove the sound of the new out of the way. For me, ""Ruthless Gravity"" typifies Astralwerks' partially concealed loathing of innovation. Just one look at their roster and you'll see example after example of shoddy talent and crummy back-in-the-day-ism. Despite the prevalence of vapid schlock, As If to Nothing displays one genuine surprise in Evan Dando. Dando brings a maturity and sensitivity that I had hitherto not suspected he was capable of. Though the song, ""Wake Up in New York,"" lifts sections from Kate Bush's ""Moments of Pleasure,"" Dando's reserved solemnity gives As If to Nothing a grace it doesn't deserve. Armstrong does superbly to restrain himself from augmenting Dando with anything but an acoustic guitar for the first fifty seconds. But inevitably, Armstrong wants the spotlight trained back on him and lobs string salvoes to crush Dando's affecting delivery. The title As If to Nothing fits this execrable CD perfectly. Putting aside for a moment Armstrong's neutering of his ""featured artists,"" what galls me is his rootlessness. I can detect no affiliation with or reference to any classical tradition. I'm not asking him to wave the Darmstadt or Vienna gang sign, but at least show an awareness of the intricacies of composition other than those mandated by the Muzak Corporation. Though this record courts an audience who despises creativity and innovation, it will disappoint even them by not giving them a single decent melody to hum along to. At least Moby gave his audience ""South Side"" and ""Porcelain."" The dominant force of any Armstrong piece, the strings, are a unified mass, undifferentiated and relentless in their turgid banality. They move like a column of artillery, crushing any small beauty beneath their lumbering feet. Such tactics work splendidly for tender moments in a Michael Bay picture (surely Armstrong's next outing), but they have no place in any music collection.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/292-as-if-to-nothing/,Astralwerks,2002.0,"I recently had the opportunity to listen to Craig Armstrong's album 'As If to Nothing'. As an electronic and rock enthusiast, I was eager to see what Armstrong had to offer. Unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed with what I heard. With a rating of only 2.2 out of 10, I must say that I am not surprised. 

For those unfamiliar with the artist, Craig Armstrong is a Scottish composer, pianist, and electronic musician. Armstrong is well known for his collaborations with Massive Attack, Madonna, and U2, and for scoring films like Moulin Rouge! and The Great Gatsby. With such an impressive resume, I was excited to dive into 'As If to Nothing' and see what Armstrong had in store for me.

The album begins with 'Ruthless Gravity', which immediately catches your attention with its upbeat tempo and rock-infused electronic sound. The track is enjoyable, but unfortunately, it sets the tone for the rest of the album. As the album progresses, it becomes evident that the tracks lack depth and diversity. Each song follows a similar rhythm and sound, making it difficult to distinguish between them. 

As someone who appreciates electronic and rock music, I was disappointed by the lack of creativity and innovation in 'As If to Nothing'. The album felt mundane and lackluster, with songs that failed to capture my attention or my heart. 

Despite my disappointment with the album, I cannot deny that Armstrong is a talented musician. His piano skills shine through in certain tracks, such as 'Waking Up in Time' and 'Gentle Piece'. But even these tracks feel like a missed opportunity, as they lack the complexity and nuance that I expected from someone with Armstrong's musical background.

In conclusion, while the album has a few positive moments, 'As If to Nothing' fails to deliver the emotional depth and creativity that I seek in an electronic and rock album. It is a shame that such a talented musician did not deliver what I anticipated, but perhaps it is simply a case of the artist going in a direction that did not resonate with me.","1.

Wild Nothing,Gemini,Rock,8.2,June 3 2010,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Though some of indie's brightest leading men have come through Virginia's halls of higher education (Steve Malkmus, David Berman, Travis Morrison), your average college rock band in the Old Dominion area probably sounds more like Agents of Good Roots. So if you live in a place like Blacksburg, Va., home of the Virginia Tech campus and not much else, and you want to be in a tropical punk act (Facepaint), an introspective singer-songwriter project (Jack & the Whale), or a band that covers Kate Bush instead of Dave Matthews (Wild Nothing's breakthrough rendition of ""Cloudbusting""), you'll probably have to do what Jack Tatum did and start them yourself. Gemini finds Tatum constructing a striking, solitary monument to just about anyone who moped, sulked, or bedsat their way through the 1980s. His love of dreamy, fuzzy, handcrafted guitar-pop isn't far removed from the Radio Dept. or the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, but he displays a more comprehensive and widespread commitment to classic indie pop sounds. Revivalism notwithstanding, his craftsmanship is undeniable and the details are spot-on: Check the reflective bell tone in ""Live in Dreams"", the Cocteau Twins-like, artificial synth tom in ""Drifter"", and the Johnny Marr homage in the twinkly guitar fade-in that begins ""Our Composition Book"". While Tatum plays hopscotch with his collection of 4AD, Factory, and Slumberland records, Gemini has plenty more to offer than sonic verisimilitude. On album opener ""Live in Dreams,"" he sings, ""Our lips won't last forever and that's exactly why/ I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die,"" and the lyric plays out like Gemini in miniature: While Tatum's words can edge on maudlin, his delivery is more romantic than dreary, and there's a sly, understated, and subtly addictive melody that gorgeously frames his sentiments. And melodies like that one, which the album features in spades, are ultimately what make Gemini more than just another indie pop record, and often more than the sum of its parts. Of course, that's not to say that each of them connects instantly. Though a handful of immediate standouts reward first listens, the record's debt-to-influence ratio may initially seem to overshadow the strength of the music. However, repeat spins reveal Tatum's strikingly innate sense of songcraft, as these tracks gradually earworm their way into daily life. Similar to Bradford Cox's early work as Atlas Sound or the more similarly indebted Nick Harte of Shocking Pinks, Wild Nothing doesn't feel like a facile genre exercise so much as honest personal expression borne of intense musical fanhood. And in a strange way, it becomes something of a deceptively joyous affair, a reminder of why so many songwriters retreat to bedrooms or garages to lose themselves in the music-making process. Gemini is grand when it sulks, and even better when it's in motion-- check the falsetto hooks of ""Confirmation"" and ""Summer Holidays"", or the clattering, kinetic ""Chinatown"". Tatum carves a tunnel from Ibiza's beaches to Manchester's rain-soaked fairgrounds, and in the process, captures a lot of what is exciting about underground music's current classic indie-pop fixation.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14280-gemini/,Captured Tracks,2010.0,"If you're a music fan, you're probably no stranger to the sound of Wild Nothing, a band that's been on the scene for almost a decade now. Their newest album, ""Gemini,"" is a true testament to the band's skill and evolution, and it's no wonder it's getting rave reviews and a rating of 8.2 out of 10.

Before I dive into the music itself, let's talk about the backstory behind Wild Nothing's creation of this album. Born from the mind of artist Jack Tatum, Wild Nothing was originally a solo project before quickly evolving into a full band. ""Gemini"" is their second full-length album, released in 2010, and it's been garnering attention ever since.

The album's opening track, ""Live In Dreams,"" hooks the listener from the moment it begins, with its bright and jangly guitar riff overlaying a heavy drum beat. The song's lyrics are introspective, speaking to the emotional turmoil of growing up and trying to maintain connections with people from our past. The album as a whole follows this trend of introspection, with tracks like ""Your Rabbit Feet"" diving into the anxieties of social expectation and the fear of missing out.

One of the most striking things about ""Gemini"" is the range of emotions it captures throughout its runtime. While some tracks are upbeat and danceable, like ""Chinatown,"" others like ""Gemini"" are softer and more contemplative. The album's production is smooth, with a clear focus on instrumentation, and it's clear that the band has a deep love and understanding of the rock genre they're working within.

As someone who's been a fan of Wild Nothing since their early days, I can say with confidence that ""Gemini"" is a true standout in their discography. The album feels like a natural evolution from their debut album, yet there's a new sense of confidence and maturity that elevates it to a new level. From the instrumentals to the lyrics to the overall mood, the album captures the feeling of being young and unsure, while also capturing the beautiful moments of clarity and excitement that come with it.

In conclusion, ""Gemini"" is truly a gem of an album. It's a testament to Wild Nothing's skill as musicians, and it's an album that deserves to be played on repeat, with headphones on and the volume turned up. Highly recommended for anyone looking to discover some new rock songs.","1. Review A contains more sophisticated language and use of literary devices such as alliteration and metaphors.

Pedro the Lion,The Only Reason I Feel Secure EP,Rock,7.5,March 6 2002,Kevin Adickes,,"At any house party, at any given time, there's a person who has isolated himself in one of the rooms, alone with a guitar. Sure, there's a revolving fanbase whose ranks are refreshed by the ever-circulating mass of people listening in hushed awe, but the only constant is the guitar player... and his is the loneliest of lives. His music is considered a ""buzzkill,"" as it generally reflects his disillusionment with the politics of the social world and will temporarily permeate the euphoric ambience of any who dare enter the room for a song. Somewhere along the way, David Bazan made the decision that life outside that room just wasn't worth the toll it took on the soul. Now he permanently resides there, subtly sermonizing to any who'll listen. Throughout the course of Pedro the Lion's career, Bazan has kept his arrangements relatively sparse, and The Only Reason I Feel Secure certainly didn't make any attempt to break from that tradition upon its initial Made in Mexico release. The EP, comprised of five songs dealing with ""criticism"" of all things, first introduced Bazan's self-defeating love for conceptualist departure which would be fully realized on his 30-minute opus Winners Never Quit. Now that the band has jumped ship from Made in Mexico, their back catalog is getting the Jade Tree treatment, complete with repackaging and, in the case of The Only Reason I Feel Secure, the inclusion of a few bonus tracks. Though the EP's re-release certainly won't galvanize the industry, it remains the definitive litmus test for those unfamiliar with Pedro's Eitzel-esque song structures and valium-induced contemplations on life. Much fuss is unnecessarily made of Bazan's Christian leanings. Luckily, Pedro the Lion have always been reasonable, lyrically speaking. Rather than openly addressing the Christian God, they opt to lament through ambiguity which occasionally yields some awkwardly worded sentiments. Still, there's something disarming, even from an objectivist's standpoint, about the disparity and wide-eyed inquiry in lyrics like, ""I hear that you don't change/ How do you expect to keep up with the trends/ You won't survive the information age."" This, coupled with the somber arrangement of ""Letter from a Concerned Follower,"" makes for one of the disc's better moments. If not for former labelmate Damien Jurado's similarly charred pipes and thematic offerings, Pedro the Lion could easily escape on the potency of their lyrics. However, it seems that everything Bazan tries to accomplish on The Only Reason has already been done before, albeit better. So if you consider yourself a fan of the Lion, do yourself a favor and go pick up Jurado's Rehearsals for Departure. Oh, and pretty much anything by American Music Club. Ex-Pitchforker Zach Hooker gave The Only Reason I Feel Secure a slightly overwhelming 8.4 upon its initial release. Purism be damned, but there's something that just doesn't bode well about an EP that boasts a whopping total of three new tracks (one being a live interpretation of ""Invention,"" a song found earlier on the record), a lyrics sheet, and an inflated price. The slightly abridged The Only Reason is still widely available and isn't nearly as much of a strain on your pocketbook. Both make for the perfect accompaniment to that 4:00am disillusionment that has occasionally claimed us all. Unfortunately, such moments are few and far between, and Bazan's output just doesn't sport the same underlying complexity as contemporaries Red House Painters, Will Oldham, and other such artists whose music is often denoted by meditations in the same mood. Pedro the Lion hail from Nathaniel Hawthorne's America. This is what wayward Puritans would headbang to. Satan has invariably given us greater musical gifts, but for those introverts facing more exalted theological issues, The Only Reason I Feel Secure fits like a tailored rosary. Of course, life back then was stark and simple, and the Lion make no qualms about the utter incomplexity of their work. Though it cuts down on extraneous and unnecessary accompaniment, it also makes for a complete lack of surprise when Bazan unsheathes the old verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge formula song after song. It's funny, though, that emo, a genre obviously begat by Beelzebub himself, finds so many of its contributions inspired by the word of God.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6212-the-only-reason-i-feel-secure-ep/,"Made in Mexico,Made in Mexico",1999.0,"For those of you who have yet to listen to Pedro the Lion, let me introduce you to one of the most eclectic rock bands around. Hailing from Seattle, this band has been pushing the musical boundaries of rock for over two decades. And while their music leans heavily towards the melancholic, it is never short on nuance, introspection and a feeling of sincerity that is hard to come by.

Their EP ""The Only Reason I Feel Secure"" is a perfect example of this. With seven tracks that weave stories of personal struggle and the search for identity, this EP encapsulates everything that makes Pedro the Lion such a fascinating band.

The album was released in 1999, during a time when alternative rock was on the rise, and grunge was starting to wane. But Pedro the Lion never really fit into either of those categories. Their sound is darker, more haunting, and their lyrics are more introspective than most of their peers.

What sets this EP apart from other Pedro the Lion albums is its brevity. With each track averaging around 3 minutes, the band stripped down their sound and focused on delivering raw emotional energy. The opener, ""Criticism as Inspiration,"" is a perfect example of this. Over a gentle guitar riff, frontman David Bazan delivers lyrics that are incredibly relatable: ""I heard criticism as inspiration/Till I could hear no more/Now destruction's become so routine/But I can't seem to throw anything away.""

Throughout the EP, Bazan's voice is a standout. It's deep, rich, and expressive, in a way that evokes both pain and comfort. And while the lyrics do focus heavily on personal struggle, they never veer into the realm of self-indulgence. Instead, they're a reflection of the complexities of life and the world around us.

One of the highlights of the album is ""The Longer I Lay Here,"" which stands out for its use of strings and subdued piano. The track builds slowly, with Bazan's voice doubling back on itself, creating an echo chamber of pain and heartache.

The only real criticism I have for this EP is that it rides the same emotional wave throughout its seven tracks. It would have been interesting to see the band experiment with different sounds, tempos, and styles. Still, it's hard to fault an EP for delivering a cohesive and powerful listening experience.

Overall, ""The Only Reason I Feel Secure"" is a must-listen for anyone who is a fan of alternative rock or anyone who appreciates music that strives for emotional honesty. The band's commitment to their vision and their willingness to confront difficult topics is what sets them apart from other bands of their era. And even though it was released over two decades ago, the album continues to resonate with audiences today. I give this EP a solid 7.5 out of 10.","1.

Death Vessel,Nothing Is Precious Enough for Us,Folk/Country,7.4,August 19 2008,Marc Masters,Contributor,"Simple and modest, Joel Thibodeau's music is more versatile than it lets on. On first listen, his second album as Death Vessel may seem passive, even flat-- just competent, non-descript folk-rock. Give it time, though, and Nothing Is Precious Enough For Us proves more intriguing. Thibodeau's un-flashy songs dip into many genres-- country, jazz, bluegrass, even hard rock-- with a subtlety that makes their range easy to miss. But then almost everything about Thibodeau's music is easy to miss, due to the hypnotic appeal of his voice. A flowing, siren-like croon, it has garnered attention for how feminine it sounds. But even more stunning is its effortless power. Thibodeau rarely varies his style or cadences, often staying locked in step with each melody, yet his singing is consistently striking. Though his enunciation is a bit blurry and he's slightly buried in the mix, his voice shines like a high-beam through fog, more emotive instrument than literal communicator. Even when you can hear what Thibodeau is singing, his meaning is elusive. Characters and descriptions hide and disappear, with restraint that seems fearful of language. ""I am versed in silence,"" he purrs in ""Block My Eye"", a tune that pulls back whenever it could step forward. Later, ""Bruno's Torso"" offers a hero who's ""bad at words"" and deals in ""unspoken promises,"" a ""mantis without a prayer."" Even on the bouncy ""Obadiah in Oblivion"", Thibodeau sounds cryptically shy: ""If halvsies are equal to none/ And nothing is precious enough for us/ Then we are none, perfectly none."" Musically, the album is similarly restrained. Most songs have simple melodies with sparse accents, a mix akin to late-period Camper Van Beethoven. The best are gentle and meticulous, such as the fading ""Peninsula"" and the banjo-driven hymn ""Fences Around Field"". But Thibodeau can muscle up too-- on ""Exploded View"", his forceful swing culminates in a noisy guitar solo. A final climax comes on ""Circa"", whose swaying melody recalls Will Oldham circa Ease Down the Road. That conclusive tune would be a great ending to Nothing Is Precious Enough For Us, but Thibodeau falters by adding the slight ""Belt of Foam"", dragged down by a smarmy trumpet solo. He recovers immediately on ""Taken Up Again"", an instrumental that revisits previous melodies in winding-down, ready-for-bed mode. Subtracting his voice from that final song is a risky move, but an appropriate one for an album that suggests literal words are no match for suggestive sound.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12098-nothing-is-precious-enough-for-us/,Sub Pop,2008.0,"Death Vessel's ""Nothing Is Precious Enough for Us"" is an album that takes the listener on an emotional journey. With its combination of folk and country sounds, this work showcases the band's ability to craft introspective and raw music with a delicate touch. 

The history of Death Vessel is a tale of dedication and perseverance. Frontman Joel Thibodeau, hailing from Rhode Island, has been playing music since the late '90s, and his music has evolved over the years to take on new forms, colliding genres along the way to create something truly unique. It's clear that Thibodeau's growth as an artist has informed this latest release, as it feels both mature and experimental all at once.

The album's creation story is an interesting one - it took two years to complete, with Thibodeau collaborating with a multitude of talented musicians to bring his vision to life. The recording process took place in various locations, including a secluded cabin in the woods of upstate New York. This lends a mystical quality to certain tracks on the album, such as ""Obadiah in Oblivion"", which feels like it was created while communing with nature.

As a listener, I was struck by the raw and authentic emotion present in each track. Thibodeau's voice is the standout feature of this album, with its gentle yet powerful range perfectly capturing the lyrical content of songs like ""Bruno's Torso"" and ""Loom"". But this is by no means a one-man show - the carefully crafted instrumentation, featuring lush harmonies and intricate guitar work, serves to elevate the album even further.

Overall, ""Nothing Is Precious Enough for Us"" is a solid effort from Death Vessel, though it may not be for everyone. At times, the album feels a bit meandering, with some tracks blending together into a cohesive whole. Still, I appreciate the risks the band took in experimenting with different sounds and textures. With a rating of 7.4 out of 10, I would recommend this album to anyone searching for introspective, emotionally charged folk and country.","1.

Tycho,Dive,Electronic,7.0,November 28 2011,Joe Colly,Contributor,"Scott Hansen, aka Tycho, is a fairly well-known graphic artist, and you can hear his design skills at play in his music. Like a particularly crisp logo or font, his songs have a good sense of scale and proportion, and it's clear that a lot of work goes into them. Take a look at his artwork and you'll have a good idea of what his electronic compositions sound like, too. Nostalgic, 1970s-inspired imagery, a heavy sense of tranquility and faraway longing, all tied together with a pretty sleek modernity. Several of these elements have been sort of beaten into the ground in indie music over the past few years, but with Dive, Hansen manages to pull them together in a way that still feels compelling. Tycho's tracks are built primarily with synths and sampled live instrumentation, and his electro-organic approach brings to mind leaders in this field like Boards of Canada and Bibio. Sonically, too, he explores terrain similar to those guys': ""A Walk"" and ""Coastal Break"" nail a pastoral peacefulness with warm, sepia-toned beats and flourishes of acoustic guitar. What separates Tycho, at least from a lot of the bedroom-oriented artists currently exploring similar sounds, is simple craft. These tracks are OCD-level meticulous. Hear it in the percussion: In place of the tinny, synthetic beats favored by lots of indie-ambient startups, Hansen takes extra care to capture real live drum sounds with a crack and thump that makes you feel like you're in the room with them. His attention to detail goes beyond highlighting individual instruments. It's there in the way Hansen simply builds a song, merging all the synth wooshes and percussive ripples to find a natural arc. ""Daydream"", for example, starts out fairly simple with twinkly guitars and a sturdy, knocking beat, but the song's pulse quickens as it progresses, and by the end you've got something heady enough to live up to its title. Because Hansen clearly wants this to be a deep headphone experience, those subtle shifts go a long way in holding your interest. And in terms of the imagery he builds-- fields, pastures, calming oceanic scenes-- it's all there, and it's pretty easy to set your brain on ""relax"" and conjure up those natural landscapes. If that nicely detailed tranquility is Dive's biggest selling point, it also exposes a nagging flaw, which is a lack of tension. Hansen is so committed to keeping things serene that he doesn't incorporate much danger or risk, and at times the album can feel a bit one-note. An out-of-nowhere tonal change or an occasional tinge of darkness would give the record more balance, make it more interesting. That missing element of surprise keeps Tycho from reaching the same heights as BoC or Bibio (the former more otherworldly, the latter more adventurously poppy), but ultimately Hansen succeeds at what he sets out to do. Dive might not be the most ambitious instrumental record you hear all year, but it almost always sounds good.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16071-dive/,Ghostly,2011.0,"Let me start by saying that Tycho's Dive is a great dive into the ocean of electronic music. This album is a perfect example of why Tycho, aka Scott Hansen, is considered one of the best in his genre. With a rating of 7.0 out of 10, this album is truly a delight for the ears.

The soundscapes he produces are warm and inviting. It's clear that Tycho has been creating this type of music for years, and he truly knows how to blend different elements together to create something unique. The result is a collection of tracks that flow effortlessly from one to another, creating a mesmerizing experience for the listener.

To understand the impact of Dive, it is essential to look at Tycho's history. Tycho started out as a graphic designer, and he regularly released his art under the name ISO50. However, he always had a passion for music and started creating his own. His first album, Sunrise Projector, was released in 2004, and from there, he has never looked back.

With Dive, Tycho takes his listeners on an underwater journey. The idea for Dive came when Hansen became fascinated by the idea of deep-sea diving, and the ocean's mysterious depths. This is why the album is named Dive: it's intended to feel like a deep dive in the ocean.

One of the reasons this album stands out is its mixture of electronic and acoustic sounds. The drumming patterns are intricate, and the guitar riffs are subtle, but they are an essential part of the album's fabric. The mix of organic and digital sound gives Dive a distinct feel, and it enables Tycho to create an immersive auditory world.

Another thing that stands out about Dive is its pacing. Tycho has a real talent for creating moments of tension and release in his music, and this album is no different. The ebb and flow of the tracks make it feel like a journey, and it's a journey that's well worth taking.

Personally, Dive is one of my favorite Tycho albums. It's perfect for when you want to relax or get some work done. The music is calming but never boring. It's a testament to Tycho's skill that he can create such immersive music with minimal vocals.

Overall, Dive is a fantastic album for anyone who loves electronic music. It's a testament to Tycho's evolution as an artist, and it's perfect for anyone who wants to be transported to a different world. Whether you're a long-time fan of Tycho or someone who's never heard of him before, Dive is an experience you wouldn't want to miss out on.","1.

Various Artists,The Trials of Darryl Hunt OST,,7.7,August 6 2007,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"A lot of various artist soundtrack albums featuring music ""from and inspired by"" a motion picture are really just cash grabs, full of cast-off tracks from artists who could spare them, often from a label owned by the same company that owns the studio that made the movie. The soundtrack for The Trials of Darryl Hunt is different. Sure, it features almost entirely tracks that weren't in the documentary, and it's a hodgepodge of new tracks, live performances, and even an album track or two, but it's also a benefit compilation for the Darryl Hunt Foundation, which works for wrongfully convicted prisoners. The motivation for putting it out doesn't change the quality of the music, of course, but everyone involved is to be commended for contributing to the cause. Quickly, Hunt, a young black man, was arrested under, at best, dubious circumstances for the rape and murder of a young newspaper copy editor in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and subsequently convicted by an all-white jury in spite an overwhelming lack of compelling evidence against him. There was a simple reason there was no good evidenced-Hunt was completely innocent. That didn't keep him from being re-convicted after his original conviction was overturned, though, nor did it secure him a speedy release from prison after his second conviction. Even evidence directly contrary to the state's case against him was ignored. Hunt's case became a cause celebre for people fighting against flaws in our justice system, and in his own community, served as evidence that attitudes among authorities in North Carolina had changed little since segregation. Stories like Hunt's are not nearly as uncommon as we might think or like to hope, and the film does an excellent job of showing just how senseless and avoidable his 20-year ordeal was. It's not surprising that the four new hip-hop tracks-- the only tracks by black musicians on the disc-- are the most outraged here. Each one directly takes on racism and corruption with fluid eloquence, and as such they're the most bracing songs on the soundtrack, though the indie rock that surrounds them is mostly fine on its own. Ras Kass blazes away at institutionalized racism and public indifference on ""Guilty Until Proven Innocent"", mentioning Hunt by name, and spitting furious line like ""You know what it takes/ To not hate police?"" in his trademark syncopated flow. Dead Prez's Sticman interpolates his rap comparing American justice to a shell game on ""The Hunt Is On"" with a lullaby that features the decidedly un-lullaby-like line ""the hunt is always on for us."" G-Unit's Spider Loc offers up a prison narrative brimming with details of life behind bars on ""Behind Bars"", shying away from direct attacks on the police and courts. The guys who have been at it longest, the Last Poets, team up with DÃ¤lek for the darkest of the four tracks. The Last Poets pre-date hip-hop as a true genre, and their sense of vocal rhythm is exciting and different from just about anything else. The lyrics take a broader perspective on the black condition, addressing institutional problems alongside intracommunity ones with virtuosic poetry like this: ""Even the depth in their faces does not seem to belong to them/ It seems borrowed/ On loan/ Consigned!/ To them by too many Blood and Crip fantasies dripping in dead tributes/ Dedicated to the eagerness of self-destruction."" Exclusive tracks from Portastatic and Califone have less to do with the film, but are nonetheless excellent songs their fans will want to hear. Mark Kozelek's solo rendition of the Red House Painters' ""Have You Forgotten"" is haunting and beautiful, and Andrew Bird's similarly spare violin-and-voice performance of ""Happy Day"" positively soars. Other contributions are more puzzling or just plain unwelcome. Starsailor's ""Good Souls"" was boring enough without stripping it down to a bare acoustic arrangement, while Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's ""Yankee Go Home"" just sounds garish next to everything else here. Three pieces of music on the disc actually do come from the film-Paul Brill's score is by turns droning and desolate, then feverishly animated, emotional sketches made mostly of electronic sound. ""Prison Theme"" is the most memorable, a forbidding descent into hell that puts the drums as high in the mix as everything else. Brill also contributes a lovely song called ""Powerlines"", an electro-acoustic meditation that sounds a bit like the ghost of Grandaddy. It's not cohesive, and it has a few forgettable songs on it, but The Trials of Darryl Hunt is ultimately a worthy disc assembled for a worthwhile cause.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10475-the-trials-of-darryl-hunt-ost/,Young American,2007.0,"The Trials of Darryl Hunt OST is a unique, compelling, and haunting album that simmers with an intensity that's hard to find elsewhere. This album serves as the backbone of the soundtrack for the documentary film The Trials of Darryl Hunt, which tells a story of a wrongful conviction, injustice, and perseverance.

Various artists contribute to this album, creating a genre-less atmosphere, and the result is a cohesive, magnetic piece. Each contributor breathes life into the tracks, morphing into one another yet maintaining their own distinct style.

The creation story of this album is an essential piece of background knowledge necessary to fully appreciate the magic created here. The Trials of Darryl Hunt documents the 1984 wrongful conviction of Darryl Hunt, an African American man from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for the rape and murder of a young white newspaper copy editor. Hunt was sentenced to life in prison, despite the absence of any physical evidence or eyewitness accounts. In a campaign that transcended politics, race, and geography, Darryl's defense team and supporters fought to free him. After DNA evidence proved Hunt's innocence, he was eventually released in 2004.

The creation of this album is an ode to this process and an attempt to give voice to the many people who suffered at the hands of the criminal justice system. The lyrics, the artists' powerful voices, and their distinct mix of genres create something truly special.

One of my favorites on this album is ""The Promise"" by Tracy Chapman, which showcases her haunting vocals and raw emotion. The track is a reminder that finding justice is not always easy, that seeking justice can take time, and that the journey might not be easy, but it's all worth it.

Another highlight is ""Me and the Devil Blues,"" featuring Robert Johnson. The song has an eerie guitar riff that suits the track's dark and ominous lyrics, and Johnson's voice quivers with intensity that's hard not to get swept up in.

With a rating of 7.7 out of 10, The Trials of Darryl Hunt OST is a musical experience that's hard to forget. Its powerful messages resonate with the injustices faced by the convicted and their families, and the album provides a heartfelt and sometimes painful depiction of a system that's supposed to protect us but instead fails many. It's an album that has earned its place in my music collection and one that I'll return to often.","1. Both reviews discuss the soundtrack for the documentary film ""The Trials of Darryl Hunt.""

Fhloston Paradigm,The Phoenix,Electronic,6.7,July 7 2014,Abby Garnett,Contributor,"When King Britt's Presents Fhloston Paradigm first appeared on Hyperdub in 2012, it seemed a fairly gritty offering from a producer known mostly for emotive house. But the Philadelphia-born DJ, who got his start touring with Digable Planets, is also something of a shapeshifter: with his “King Britt Presents…” projects, he’s shuffled through a number of styles with seemingly unstoppable energy—he’s mixed classic disco-funk with jazzy chill-out textures under the name Sylk 130; another project consisted entirely of re-mixed vocals from New Orleans gospel singer Sister Gertrude Morgan. One of the threads through this eclectic catalogue is an underlying Afrocentrism; another is Britt’s studied approach to meticulous genre emulation. His new album, which sees Britt assuming the name Fhloston Paradigm as a full-on alias, revisits and fleshes out the same territory as the EP, which functioned as a kind of alternate soundtrack to Luc Besson’s pop-art sci-fi flick The Fifth Element (the name Fhloston Paradigm itself originated with “Fhloston Paradise,” the futuristic resort Bruce Willis’ character visits in the film.) It’s a concept that recalls not only the Afrofuturist tendencies of early techno, but the heady positivity of '90s pop culture, when science fiction trafficked more in sensory manipulation than dystopian paranoia. Britt carries it off with a sonic precision that can be dazzling, but at times strays into territory that feels blinkered by nostalgia. The menacing, back-to-basics EP cut “Chasing Rainbows” reappears, and its slowly downshifting melody remains the most memorable earworm here. The rest of The Phoenix distances itself from the gear-grinding analog techno of the EP, applying that track’s mutant-pop gravitas as a schematic for something more dramatic. The production sounds more expensive, and the arrangements more elaborate, with six of the tracks featuring guest vocalists. As a producer, Britt is in fine form here, and listening to the album on a good pair of headphones reveals truly beautiful details—the expressive drumming on “Letters of Past”, the subtle, woozy dissonance that emerges from the immersive clouds of album closer “Light on Edge”. Surprisingly, Britt’s melodic sense is easier to appreciate on the fully instrumental tracks—see the icy synth lines on the dizzying “Race to the Moon”, an early highlight. By contrast, the sung melodies sound simplistic, and when there are discernible lyrics, they’re more distracting than atmospheric. It’s hard to hear Natasha Kmeto’s appearance on “Light on Edge” without thinking of Fhloston Paradigm’s fantastic, seductive remix of her track “Deeply”, which saw him embellishing around a straightforward vocal line to hypnotic effect. The pinnacle of the album comes on the nine-minute title track, its mutating rumble of drums and ominous chords anchoring a teased-out jumble of synth notes that eventually emerges as a bee-sting-precise melody. There’s nothing more absorbing on the album, or sweeter on the ears. It’s a massive-sounding elaboration on burnt-out techno, and inventive enough to explain why a somewhat backward-looking project would find a home on Hyperdub, a label that’s always seeking to push dance music into the future. Unfortunately, the rest of The Phoenix has a tendency towards the anodyne, a flaw that lies more in the languorous composition than the execution. “Tension Remains”, which features operatic vocals from Pia Ercole, sounds like a fairly explicit call-back to Besson’s famous blue-skinned diva, but The Phoenix lacks the narrative quality to make it anything more than an amusing reference. The album is also an hour long—short by film score standards, but for an album with several leisurely ambient stretches, it’s a commitment to sit through. Fhloston Paradigm’s continued association with The Fifth Element makes sense: that film’s vision of the future was more concerned with the surface-level pleasures of gaudy costumes and kinetic choreography than developing a deeper subtext. The Phoenix is a similar beast, simultaneously muscular and fluffy, a well-polished album that sometimes feels perplexingly one-dimensional.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19499-fhloston-paradigm-the-phoenix/,Hyperdub,2014.0,"If you're looking for a fresh take on electronic music, Fhloston Paradigm's latest album, ""The Phoenix,"" may be just what you need. With a rating of 6.7 out of 10, it's clear that this album certainly isn't perfect, but it still manages to be enjoyable and thought-provoking.

For those unfamiliar with the band, Fhloston Paradigm is the brainchild of Philadelphia-based producer and DJ King Britt. With over two decades of experience in the music industry, Britt has honed his skills to create a unique sound that fuses electronic elements with live instrumentation, resulting in something that feels both futuristic and timeless.

""The Phoenix"" is Fhloston Paradigm's third full-length album, and it's a work that's been six years in the making. Britt has described the album as being inspired by the idea of rebirth and renewal, and it's easy to see how this theme has influenced the sound and structure of the record.

From the opening track, ""Portal 1,"" it's clear that ""The Phoenix"" is an ambitious work. The song begins with a series of ethereal soundscapes before giving way to a propulsive beat and hypnotic synth work. It's a track that sets the tone for the rest of the album, and it's a tone that's both exciting and introspective.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Tension Remains."" It's a song that feels like it's constantly building, with layers of percussion and synth work adding to the tension before ultimately releasing in a triumphant outro. It's the kind of track that would sound right at home in a club or on a film soundtrack.

Another highlight is ""Liloos Seduction."" It's a slower, more contemplative track that features a haunting vocal sample and a subdued beat. It's a song that's both melancholic and beautiful, and it feels like a moment of reflection amidst the more high-energy tracks on the album.

While ""The Phoenix"" is undeniably a strong effort, it's not without its flaws. Some of the tracks can feel a bit too long, and there are moments where the album feels like it's treading familiar ground. However, these minor quibbles shouldn't detract from the fact that Fhloston Paradigm has created an album that's both compelling and immersive.

Overall, ""The Phoenix"" is an album that's well worth checking out for fans of electronic music. While it's not perfect, it's a work that showcases the talents of an artist who's never content to rest on his laurels. It's a record that's both forward-thinking and reverential to the traditions of electronic music, and it's sure to leave a lasting impression on listeners.","1.

Silkworm,Italian Platinum,"Metal,Rock",7.9,June 13 2002,William Bowers,Contributor,"Tour the Art Institute on Silkworm's Chicago turf and use reverse chronology as the organizing principal of your walkthrough. Start in the contemporary art rooms and move through four-hundred-plus years of Individual Masters, then a long ways back to the rooms showcasing ancient pieces. You can work up a pretty good bummer realizing how you're forced to herald the lone, rare Singular Geniuses, only to end up looking at treasures made by anonymous members of communities in which most people were artisans of some kind, capable of at least perfunctorily creative craftsmanship. If you're in the right pissy, generalizing mood, you can wonder if we slather over Geniuses out of a kind of guilt because they tap into something that we deep-down know shouldn't be so rare. Since most of us can barely figure out how to feed ourselves, we jump at the chance to applaud anyone with some leftover specialness. The whole mess is enough to make you tired of the accidental fascism of Geniuses filling supposedly organic 'leadership vacuums,' offering us chances to confirm our inferiority as we stand in the crowd at their concerts, or go to their movies, or read their books, viewing our consumption of them as sufficiently sophisticated and 'artistic' enough to justify the rest of our afternoon's being spent playing video games or bitching at our sex-pals or staring at the ceiling or crying into our cans of Surge. Okay, that kneejerk theory is stoops: I know that 'the people' aren't going to rise up from quoting Aflac commercials to start an artistic revolution, and even if it did happen I bet I'd sleep through the best parts. Even back-burner geniuses have consistent work ethics. Plus, those shangri-la ancient art-cultures probably didn't have access to convenient toilets of every personality-reflecting color. Alls I'm saying is that we gotta practice moderation and stop demanding that every album announce an Elvrum or Mangum or Yorke. As soon as you ease up on the need for a new disposable Jesus to mimic, you realize that there's a lot to be said for the refreshing geniuslessness of bands like Silkworm. Silkworm has no star to fantasize about sleeping with. No dominating image or attitude emerges to influence your hairstyle. The lyrics never leave you throttled by the image of them being read out of a Damn-I'm-Clever Notebook #47. Instead of life-affirming passion, their albums, Italian Platinum gloriously included, offer subtle slapstick nihilism. Their website makes several references to how shocked they are that they still exist, and it dubs their own discography ""shit we have shat."" Their concert journals humbly acknowledge that their slippery fit-rock is often incidental music for drunks to fidget and commingle to. Maybe the Genius thing is a factor in sustainability; it's hard to listen to what Pavement and Silkworm were doing ten years ago and conclude that Silkworm would outlast the other. They get overlooked as old-guard almost-weres, but an elite armada of folks with extensive CD budgets remain rightfully grateful for their unambitious clamor. Italian Platinum, whose packaging is so minimal that it's a waste of paper, is the band's best release since 1996's whoopass and splashy Firewater, though it just sounds like uninviting racket the first time you hear it, and it continues Firewater's preoccupation with alcohol. In other words, if Firewater is their OK Libations, this disc is their Kid AA-- slightly more penitent and therefore a great soundtrack for a punitive post-hangover jog. Anyone who has ever dropped a bottle opener and then broken their finger trying to get it out from behind the fridge will appreciate ""Bourbon Beard"" and its sloshy, regretful counterparts. Coach Albini once again corroborates their convulsive assault, micing the guitars and vocals warmly, while the bass and drums maintain his standard warplane-hangar dynamics. The sound is earthily underscored by all manner of piano, organ, clavinet, and synthy touches, as well as guest vocalist Kelly Hogan's counterintuitive heartthroat. Silkworm brings the chops, working odd pauses into their solos like J. Mascis undergoing physical therapy. Riffs abound, some Kirk Hammett fretfests go down, and whammy bars occasionally peer out to inspire air-guitarists everywhere. The abundance of classic tropes (axe histrionics, anthemic refrain buildups, epic breakdowns, backup 'bops' and 'oohs') will leave you trying to gauge the band's sincerity. Are they spoofing what's been done to death, or nominating themselves as deserving candidates to give the oft-resurrected rock horse a respectful, hellacious kick? Italian Platinum is a slow-burner, an acquired taste, like, uh, Pawpaw's hard liquor. It grew on everyone I know who was in proximity to multiple spins, reducing several of them to murmuring choruses from hits like the opener ""(I Hope U) Don't Survive,"" the retro shoutalong ""The Old You,"" the no-wave ""The Brain,"" the pollution-happy hoedown ""Dirty Air,"" and the clunkily-titled but killer ""A Cockfight of Feelings,"" a mud-puddle reminder that the verse-chorus-verse formula can be a lil' abstruse. Even the subdued, repetitive ""Moving,"" which is about moving in the unmetaphorical way that the Go-Gos' ""Vacation"" was about vacations, colonizes your tune-lobe. If only radio switched to an all-scab format, Silkworm's lurch-and-bounce could be credited for embracing the obvious throb of concise garage-prog-- a style you could call, to quote one of this album's few bombs, ""world-proof.""",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7157-italian-platinum/,Touch and Go,2002.0,"Looking for something that will seep into your veins and ignite your musical soul? Look no further than Silkworm's Italian Platinum album. With a rating of 7.9 out of 10, this Metal-Rock combo is not to be missed.

Silkworm has been in the game for quite some time, gaining a well-deserved reputation as one of the most energetic bands in the industry. From their early days to present times, the band has pushed the boundaries of Metal and Rock music with their spellbinding energy, unique sound, and immense talent.

Italian Platinum, in particular, is the perfect showcase of their creativity and artistic flair. It's the kind of album that makes you want to jump up and shout your soul out, with each track feeling like a dose of adrenaline to the system. Songs like ""Rebel Queen"" and ""Sons of Slaves"" are so bursting with energy that you can't help but feel like you're on top of the world.

What stands out about this album's creation story is the band's dedication to producing a sound that truly captures their raw emotion and intense energy. From the recording process to the mastering, everything was done with one goal in mind - to produce an album that would blow their fans away.

I had the pleasure of seeing Silkworm live, and I can attest that their studio work doesn't even come close to capturing the raw energy and intensity of their live performances. However, Italian Platinum does come close to capturing the essence of what makes this band so special on stage.

The album does an excellent job of showcasing the unique talents of each member, from the thunderous drums to the electrifying guitar riffs. The dynamic interplay between the instruments creates an atmosphere of pure musical magic that will keep you hooked from beginning to end.

Overall, Silkworm's Italian Platinum album is the perfect showcase of just how talented and creative this band can be. It's energetic, intense, and the perfect dose of Metal-Rock that will leave you feeling like you can take on the world.

Tinariwen,Elwan,Global,8.2,February 18 2017,Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,"Since coming to the attention of Western listeners in the 2000s, the Tuareg artists in Tinariwen have managed to keep their “desert blues” sound intact, while varying some elements of songwriting craft. The largely acoustic aesthetic of 2011’s Tassili saw input from American indie talents, like TV on the Radio’s Kyp Malone and Wilco’s Nels Cline. On 2014’s Emmaar, Tinariwen reveled in some funkier arrangements. Elwan offers another solid collection of tunes that merge West African styles and guitar riffs inspired by American folk forms. The album can swing quickly across a wide range of moods, moving dramatically between feverish group workouts and more personal, acoustic laments. And the continued political turmoil in their native northern Mali—including the targeting of the band’s members by Islamist militants—has provided these songwriters with no shortage of inspiration for world-weary lyrics. This time around, Tinariwen’s collaborations work more ideally than on previous outings. Sometime Queens of the Stone Age member Alain Johannes brings his “cigar box guitar” to the grooving, communal song “Talyat.” And on the uptempo opener, “Tiwàyyen,” guest guitarist Kurt Vile merges fully with the other members of the ensemble. During this first appearance, there’s little sense that he’s interested in calling attention to himself. (The song’s real stars are the spirited backing vocalists, who swarm during the choruses.) On bassist Eyadou Ag Leche’s “Nànnuflày,” though, Vile’s reverb-heavy guitar tone is more easily recognized. The romanticized sense of reverie in his playing—familiar from albums like 2013’s Wakin on a Pretty Daze—seems to exert a strong influence over the entire band’s performance, thereby giving Tinariwen a new vibe to inhabit. Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, one of the group’s principal singer-guitarists, makes the most of this opportunity, turning in a chilled-out performance that is threaded with less vocal ornamentation than usual. The final minute’s vocals are turned over to Mark Lanegan’s coolheaded baritone: a choice that risks merely gilding the lily, but just plain works. Naturally, this core group of players doesn’t really need any help when it comes to fashioning sublime performances. On “Assàwt,” acoustic arpeggios are sometimes joined by darts of electric-guitar filigree—a mirroring of the way the song’s solo vocalist routinely welcomes a chorus of companions by his side. Elsewhere, the propulsive rock energy of “Sastanàqqàm” leavens the mood for a spell, while the mantra of “Ittus” reflects a seriousness of intent. (The latter song’s lyric reads, in its entirety: “I ask you, what is our goal/It is the unity of our nation/And to carry our standard high.”) It can be tempting, at this point, to take all the strengths of Tinariwen for granted. Once again, all their music is crisply played, and smartly sequenced. Yet while Elwan may not herald any grand stylistic breakthrough, it does manage to synthesize some of the group’s most recent experiments in a way that helps distinguish it within their overall catalog. English translations for the lyrics are available on their label’s website, but the spirit of each song is generally discernible from the performance choices. The purpose of Tinariwen’s music doesn’t undergo radical redefinition—and it doesn’t need to do so. From their beginnings in a refugee camp to their latest iteration as a world-touring entity, they can provide exultation and encouragement like few other ensembles, on any continent.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22865-elwan/,"Epitaph,Anti-",2017.0,"Tinariwen's 'Elwan' is a stunning masterpiece that showcases the band's unique blend of traditional Tuareg music and contemporary global influences. With a rating of 8.2 out of 10, this album is no doubt a testament to the band's talent and creativity.

For those unfamiliar, Tinariwen emerged in the early 1980s amidst the political turmoil of Northern Mali. The members of the band were Tuareg rebels who had been exiled to Libya, where they encountered Western music and began incorporating it into their traditional sound. When they returned to Mali, they formed Tinariwen and became pioneers of the ""desert blues"" genre, which incorporates blues, rock, and traditional African rhythms.

'Elwan' is Tinariwen's eighth studio album, and it is an intense and hauntingly beautiful work of art. The album's creation story is itself remarkable as it was recorded in multiple locations due to the band's exile from their homeland. Some tracks were recorded in Joshua Tree, California, while others were recorded in M'Hamid El Ghizlane, Morocco, and even in a makeshift studio in the back of a camper van while on tour.

Personally, 'Elwan' speaks to me on a deeply emotional level. The combination of the lyrics, the rhythms, and the melancholy melodies creates a powerful and hypnotic atmosphere that draws you into the music. The album's opening track, ""Tiwayyen,"" is a haunting and eerie plea for peace, featuring mournful vocals that float over a driving beat. It sets the tone for the rest of the album, immersing you in a desert landscape of longing and loss.

The album's standout track, however, is the hauntingly beautiful ""Sastanaqqam."" This track's hypnotic rhythm and gentle melody evoke a sense of longing and sadness that is intensely moving. The vocals are hauntingly beautiful, and the song lingers in the mind long after it has ended.

Overall, 'Elwan' is a magnificent work of art that showcases Tinariwen's incredible talent and unique sound. The band's history and the album's creation story make it all the more poignant, and the music itself is a testament to the human capacity for resilience and hope in the face of adversity.

Markant,Vice Versa,,7.8,April 9 2002,Paul Cooper,Contributor,"Markant's lone ranger, Carsten Endrass, is through with glitch. He no longer finds any value in the accidental click-and-pop that once signified recorded entropy and fractured reality. Just like the sound of running water that appeared on every ambient disc ten years ago, clicks and glitches have lost all potency. They're now just another preset sound. Endrass's Vice Versa, however, is not a wholesale return to the time before glitch. That sound is in the album, yet Endrass has reformatted it. Vice Versa, unlike Mouse on Mars' Idiology or Posthuman's Uncertainty of the Monkey, revels not in contrast or juxtaposition, but rather in interchangeability. Elements don't jar; they become subjugated to Endrass' harmonic concept. Vice Versa is a very confident album. It's a brave musician who kicks off an album with a fourteen-minute track. Yet Endrass' bravery is far from hubris. He produced over thirty vinyl releases before he issued his debut long-player, Infam, in 2001. Unfortunately, Endrass limited his vinyl productions to about 300 copes per title, and consequently, the Markant name was known more by reputation than by experience. Endrass, answering only to himself, begins Vice Versa in a digital haze reminiscent of a cloud of well-meaning mosquitoes dancing about your ears. After nearly four minutes, the harmonic and melodic elements of the opening track, ""Spurwechsel,"" emerge. It's as though he's cleansing the listener in anticipation of the Markant concept of music. Fortunately, Endrass has the skills to match his boast. Vice Versa abounds in idiosyncratic and original melodic twists, dips, dives, and arches. Unlike Mouse on Mars who sometimes disguise their tunes in offbeat programming or Venusian ska-otica, Endrass doesn't parade prodigious programming abilities. Like Galerie Stratique or Isan, Endrass would rather expend energy on increasing the vocabulary of melody rather than gene-splicing sound. Initially, I bemoaned the lack of sonic innovation, but after many listens, I've become more fascinated with the sedate glass harmonica beauty of ""Natura Morte"" and the glacial drift of the title track. You might say that Geir Jensen (aka Biosphere) definitively mapped out this territory with 1997's Substrata, or that Thomas KÃ¶ner took ambience to its bleak extreme with 1998's Kaamos. And you could say that ""Deserto"" compares just as favorably to Amber-era Autechre, or that ""Laissez Faire"" sounds like Global Communications' mechanized excursions under the Reload moniker. And I couldn't even disagree with you. But I would retort that no one should visit a place just once. Endrass' terrain may be familiar, but his assessment of them is utterly his own.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5110-vice-versa/,Markant,2002.0,"If you're a fan of experimental music that pushes boundaries and genres, then Vice Versa by Markant is an album that you need to check out. With a nan genre rating of 7.8 out of 10, it's clear that the creators of this album have done something right. From the moment I started listening, I was intrigued by the layers of sound and complex rhythms that make up each track. 

The band's history is something worth mentioning as well. Markant was formed over a decade ago by a group of friends who shared a passion for creating something that was both experimental and accessible. Over the years, they have honed their craft, taking inspiration from the world around them and incorporating it into their music. And the result is nothing short of amazing. 

The story of Vice Versa itself is equally fascinating. The album was created during a period when the band was experimenting with a new sound and direction. They wanted to create something that was both experimental and accessible, and so they began to push the boundaries of what was possible. The result is a collection of songs that are both challenging and deeply rewarding. 

One of the things that I appreciate most about Vice Versa is the way that it seamlessly blends different genres and influences. Markant has always been known for their ability to incorporate a variety of sounds and styles into their music, and this album is no exception. From the funky beats of ""Reverse Gear"" to the dark and brooding sounds of ""Inertia,"" each track offers a different perspective on what music can be. 

But for me, the standout track of the album has to be ""Parallel Universe."" This song is a perfect example of what Markant does best. With its droning synths, repeating melodies, and hypnotic rhythms, it pulls you into a world that is at once familiar and alien. It's a song that feels like a journey, and every time I listen to it, I discover something new. 

In conclusion, if you're a fan of music that challenges you and takes you on a journey, then Vice Versa by Markant is an album that you need to experience. It's an album that rewards the listener who is willing to take the time to really listen and appreciate the intricacies of each track. With its blend of different genres and influences, it's an album that truly transcends categorization. I can't recommend it enough.","1.

Terius Nash,1977,"Pop/R&B,Rap",7.9,September 8 2011,Jordan Sargent,Contributor,"1977 is-- to quote Terius Nash himself-- an ""Internet album."" Nash (aka The-Dream) released it for free on his website on August 31, with the begrudged blessing of his bosses at Def Jam. It's his fourth solo album, but his first released in this manner, and it raises the question of whether or not we are supposed to alter our expectations. Is this a tossed-off re-packaging of demos? Is he merely trying to satiate a fanbase waiting for an album that he promised to drop this past June? We don't know the answers to those questions (although my guesses would be ""no"" and ""maybe""), but it would seem foolish to hold 1977 to a lower standard. It's no longer unusual-- especially in the world of rap, and to a lesser extent R&B-- to put a full album on the Internet for free. If Nash had included a way for fans to pay what they wanted for the album, he would've been adopting a strategy utilized in previous years by Radiohead and Girl Talk. And yet, Nash is asking us to adjust our expectations. Crucially though, he's not asking that we alter our notions of what we expect of him, just what we expect from him. 1977 represents not a conscious change in quality, but a conscious change in style and sound, at least for the time being. A few days before he released the album, he tweeted, ""When I'm 40 ill write Myself a Pop Smash just so I can Perform on National TV. Not that hard to do. But that's not who I am right now."" True to his word, 1977 often strays far from Nash's few solo pop smashes. Instead, it is a deeply personal and presumably therapeutic album. It's one that he fought with his label to release, that he's putting out under his birth name and titled for his birth year, and for which he has put the lyrics of every song up on his website. Though he was predictably coy about the subject, the specter of his divorce from singer Christina Milian looms over it. In its sparseness and unrelenting directness, the album's most recent precedent is Kanye West's break up opus 808s & Heartbreak, and much like that record, it's already proven to be a divisive if misunderstood album. It showcases a bitter and angry Nash, and though he has previously dabbled in acidic and unflinching break-up songs, 1977 is his first album to largely focus on something other than his sexual prowess. Like West, his vitriol is mostly spewed outward, with seemingly little regard for the feelings or reputation of whoever is on the other side. There is Spanish guitar, as if Nash imagines himself readying for a duel. There is acoustic guitar, as if to accentuate his confessionals. And there is guitar feedback, as if his heart were screaming out. As a portrayal of a broken relationship, 1977 at its best is as vivid as it is one-sided. ""Wake Me When It's Over"", which effectively utilizes the glacial R&B of Drake and his producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, opens the album with a wrenching portrait of a romance falling apart in plain view of friends and the public. As Nash coos the chorus we find him frozen in amber, unable to shake a break up for which he claims he would've taken bullets. Even tracks like ""Rolex"" and ""Wish You Were Mine"", which don't hew as close to the theme as others, have a spitefulness that hint at an intense desire to throw your recovery in your ex's face. But of course, writing songs from this point of view presents some problems. Mainly, one has to be able to stomach the one-sided bile and Nash's likely half-truths. To that end, 1977, like West's 808s, functions best as a look inside the mind of a man wrecked by a trying relationship and a worse break up. His failings should not be excused, but the feelings exist, and have likely existed inside most of us at some point (regardless of gender), and to that end, they're understandable even if they're not completely acceptable. There are also essential moments on the album where Nash perhaps unwittingly reveals the more aggressively resentful songs to be a sort of Pyrrhic victory. One is on ""Form of Flattery"", where he addresses the ex he hates and seethes, ""I'm not better than that."" Another is ""Wedding Crasher"", the absolute standout here, wherein Nash shows up at his ex's wedding and admits, once and for all, that his attempts to replace her have been futile. Sonically, it recalls the buoyant lightness of Love King's ""Florida University"", though it's less cloying, and this time he's basically saying, ""fuck you"" back at himself. All that said, Nash still misses a huge opportunity. One of the legitimate criticisms of 808s was that West's ex had no forum to respond to the album. While it's obviously impossible to expect Nash to cede space on 1977 to Milian (or whomever), there is a critical difference between himself and West. Nash is a songwriter by trade who made his name writing from the perspective of people (mostly women) other than himself, including what may be the biggest female empowerment single of the past decade. When Nash does give the floor completely to a female voice, it's for the relatively unknown Casha to sing a cover of Deniece Williams' 1981 hit ""Silly"". As a tune, the song itself is fine, but framed by Nash's wrath it sadly comes off as pleading and passive. How great would it have been for Nash to use that spot on the album to turn the pen on himself, if only for one song? Still, 1977 itself is a success, even if it doesn't stand up completely to his three previous releases. As a standalone depiction of a deteriorating relationship and miserable break up, it's engrossing and, even to a fault, extremely honest. As a piece of music, it eschews the richness and lushness of those albums, a sound that's felt on the verge of becoming stale. 1977 could be called a palate cleanser, but it's way too torn-up to be that. It's more like a shot (or three) of whisky. Sometimes that feels like exactly what you need.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15792-1977/,Radio Killa,2011.0,"Terius Nash's Music Album '1977': A Flourishing Blend of Pop, R&B, and Rap 

From the first track, 'Wake Me When It's Over', I was immediately drawn into the world of Terius Nash's 1977 album. The blend of pop, R&B and rap is executed in a way that it simply blows your mind. It felt like each song was from a different world, taking me along for the ride as the album progressed. 

The story behind the album's creation is as intriguing as the album itself. Terius Nash is actually the real name of The-Dream, a Grammy-winning songwriter who has worked with huge artists such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Mariah Carey, to name a few. He originally released 1977 as a free mixtape in 2011, after facing some label issues. While it didn't get a lot of attention at the time, it's since been re-released as an official album in 2012, and has earned a well-deserved rating of 7.9 out of 10. 

The sound and feel of the album is definitely unique, something that no one has ever heard before. The songs are a mixture of high energy tracks like 'Wedding Crasher', showcasing Nash's undeniable hip-hop influences, and slower tracks like 'Ghetto', where he wonderfully sings about his life and his experiences growing up. 

One of my favorite tracks in the album is 'Long Gone', where Nash tells his story about a doomed relationship, and how he deals with heartache. This song taught me a lot about moving on and learning from our past experiences. Another track that I found myself listening to on repeat was 'Used to Be', which is an anthem for those who are starting to realize that they are outgrowing their relationships.

Various Artists,DFA Compilation #2,,9.0,November 3 2004,Nick Sylvester,Contributor,"Here's a joke: Black Leotard Front's maggot-brained ""Casual Friday"" kickstarts the DFA Compilation #2 with a blast of pink streamers, mutant glitter, and a series of Gainsbourg-Does-Frankfurt whatnots whose sex quotient, to piggish ears, rivals the breathiest, most fecal shit-porn yelp. The Greatest Peep Show Ever then keeps on peeping for about 40 more seconds, when suddenly all three members of this disco-fuck troupe start chanting, ""Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!"" like they're on ""Sesame Street"". It's the audio equivalent of, say, the MILF Hunter going off-camera mid-hunt and putting on Groucho Marx glasses and a Dr. Seuss Cat hat before coming back and expecting us to pick up where we left off. Around that song's three-minute mark, Black Leotard Front play their cheapest, dirtiest trick, offering up ad nauseam a clumsy English translation of the song's Vorwort, replacing the original's self-involved whispers with militant matters of fact: ""I was leaving the office."" ""I took off my dress."" ""I put on my overcoat to surprise you in the flesh."" By this point, ""Casual Friday"" is barely a fifth of the way through its 15-minute runtime, the three-disc DFA Compilation #2 has hardly even started, and there we are, pants around ankles and red in the kisser. If this review was Uncle Milty, it would raise its palms and smirk. ""Casual Friday"" sums up DFA Records circa 2004 with startling accuracy. The qualities that have typically characterized the label-- rapt attention to genre, an implicit skepticism of easy and less song-y dance music, a subtle sense of humor-- continue to crystallize as a slew of new additions (sound engineers Delia & Gavin and the aforementioned Black Leotard Front, J.O.Y., Pixeltan, Liquid Liquid) expand and diversify its often pigeonholed roster. These guys actually do give a shit, all the way down to the packaging and sequencing of Compilation #2, which collects the DFA's vinyl-only releases from this year and more than a few compilation-only exclusives. What could have been a mere anthology of the label's uniformly excellent 2004 output is, additionally, a meticulously assembled personal narrative. This is a label that balances its musical and commercial aspirations with an earthy, no-bullshit disposition and-- let's say it-- the world's best fucking handclaps. Tracks like the lanky ""Casual Friday"", Pixeltan's sub-bass masterpiece ""Get Up/Say What (DFA Remix)"", and LCD Soundsystem's still unspeakably great ""Yeah"" are 10-minute dance songs with beginnings, middles, and ends; people who complain about the downtime on ""Get Up"" or the crass acid freakout finale of ""Yeah"" completely miss the point. Delia & Gavin's Gottschingkind ""El Monte"" and the DFA remix of ""Rise"" are even more expansive, as patterns settle in and flesh out before the next move is made, a bravado afforded to only the most tightly-wound loops. The DFA's remix of J.O.Y.'s ""Sunplus"" wins the label's ""Most Bizarre Release Award""-- the reception to it has been mixed, and for many people this is the first DFA release they haven't liked-- but it's also possibly their most important record. James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy have worked on several unlikely acts at this point-- N.E.R.D. and ""She Wants To Move"" come to mind-- but in truth their high-carb basslines and unclamped hi-hats were making them fat, and it's about time they went on a diet. Like it or not-- and I like it-- their Slits-y, minimal ""Sunplus"" remix speaks to the team's crucial ability to change and stay the same all at once: Their malleability is on perfect display here. The label boasts further variety with Juan MacLean's crooked riddim ""Dance Hall Modulator Dub"" and Liquid Liquid's re-recording of ""Bellhead"". On the latter, Murphy and Goldsworthy admirably keep low profiles in the face of such personally influential living legends, merely trading the original's trash-can reverb for crisp percussion and about twenty more BPM. Old reliables (The Rapture's previously UK-only ""Alabama Sunshine"" and a dub mix of ""Sister Savior""; a fine drone remix of Black Dice's tour-only single ""Wastered"", fittingly renamed ""Wasteder""); and old favorites (LCD Soundsystem's ""Beat Connection""; Eye's remix of Black Dice's ""Endless Happiness"") fill out the rest of this musical annal, most notably touching upon The Rapture's departure from the DFA. Bygones are indeed bygones, though, and if anyone's really upset about that rift, the third disc of Compilation #2 is a top-notch party mix with-- get this-- actual mixing. Along with Beats In Space's Tim Sweeney, Tim Goldsworthy outdoes himself on practically every track transition: Jittery percussive swells on ""Bellhead"" creep early into ""Echoes"" and energize the song's descending figures; the cowbells and clean squeaks of ""Sunplus"" martial the beatless ""El Monte"" and reach through all the way into the beginning of Juan MacLean's ""Give Me Every Little Thing""; and at the end, ""Beat Connection"" fights with ""Yeah"" for volume, until both of them play together at full-blast. In a word, it's glorious, a fitting old-meets-new, tongue-in-cheek gesture to conclude one of 2004's most worthwhile tales. ",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2032-dfa-compilation-2/,DFA,2004.0,"Have you ever heard an album that just leaves you breathless? That's how I felt when I first listened to 'DFA Compilation #2' by Various Artists. As a music lover and critic, I am always searching for new sounds and genres to explore, and this album offered a delightful blend of electronic and dance music that left me feeling elated.

If you're not familiar with DFA, let me give you a little bit of background. DFA is a label that was founded in 2001 by Tim Goldsworthy, James Murphy, and Jonathan Galkin. The label quickly gained a reputation for releasing cutting-edge music that blended disco, punk, and electronica, and they've been a major player in the indie music scene ever since.

The 'DFA Compilation #2' album, released in 2004, is a compilation of tracks from some of the label's most notable artists, including The Rapture, LCD Soundsystem, and Black Dice, among others. The album was put together in order to showcase the label's unique sound, and it certainly does that.

From the very first track, ""House of Jealous Lovers"" by The Rapture, the album grabs you by the ears and doesn't let go. The infectious beat and driving bass line are impossible to resist, and you'll find yourself dancing along before you even realize it. LCD Soundsystem's ""Beat Connection"" is another standout, with its funky guitar riffs and catchy chorus.

But what really sets this album apart is the way it blends different genres seamlessly. There are elements of punk, disco, and electronica all woven together into a cohesive whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. For example, Black Dice's ""Endless Happiness"" mixes distorted guitars with electronic blips and bleeps for a truly unique sound.

One thing that really stood out to me when listening to this album is just how much fun the artists seem to be having. You can hear it in the music – there's a sense of joy and playfulness that runs throughout the entire album. It's infectious, and it's something that's missing in a lot of music today.

In my personal opinion, the 'DFA Compilation #2' is one of the greatest albums of the 2000s. It's an album that I keep coming back to time and time again, and it never gets old. The fact that it's still relevant and enjoyable nearly two decades after its release is a testament to just how influential and important it is.

Overall, if you're a fan of dance or electronic music, then this album is an absolute must-have. It's a true masterpiece, and one that I would give a solid 9.0 out of 10 rating. So go ahead and give it a listen – you won't be disappointed.","1.

No Age,Losing Feeling,Rock,8.3,October 5 2009,Marc Masters,Contributor,"When they were first getting started back in 2007, No Age were EP fiends. They released five such missives on five different labels over just a few months, and soon after plucked tracks from them for their first full-length release, Weirdo Rippers. Since then the L.A. guitar-and-drums duo has toured so much, been written about so much, and released such a great album (Nouns), that those initial releases feel a little like ancient relics. No Age's Dean Spunt and Randy Randall have decided to return to the EP, releasing four new tracks now rather than save them for a future long-player. It's a curious move since each sounds album-ready and none are hugely different from previous work, but this band doesn't really deal in long-form anyway-- both Weirdo Rippers and Nouns barely made it past the half-hour mark. It would be cool if these tunes were deemed worthy of an EP because they're a radical departure into dark noise, or a set of Hüsker Dü covers, or a conceptual suite about the human nervous system. But it's also cool that they're just another solid No Age record. What makes Losing Feeling so solid is how it begins and ends. The opening title track simultaneously floats in place and hurtles forward, recalling the pulsing drift of Nouns' ""Sleeper Hold"". But now the band stretches a bit more, injecting the breaks with a little more tension, a little more bite. And a final rave-up shifts into high gear, turning a nice crescendo into a tidal wave. That infectious wash is matched on the opposite end of the EP by ""You're a Target"". Here the hectic rush of the opener gets drenched in a layer of shimmering guitar tones-- imagine Nouns' ""Brain Burner"" covered by the Pains of Being Pure at Heart. Those two blasts would've made a killer 7"", but the moodier songs in between build an intriguing bridge. ""Genie"" marries Randall's slow strumming to Spunt's simple whine, building rhythm without the aid of drums. ""Aim at the Airport"" goes one step further, eschewing both drums and vocals. Its looping guitar could probably fit on something released by Kranky or even Mego, but coming in between two No Age rockers, the wavy fuzz is clearly recognizable. It's not hard to imagine a voice and a drumbeat rising out of this mix were it to go on longer. The same can be said for Losing Feeling as a whole-- had No Age stuck in the studio for a few more hours, this could've easily been a stellar LP. Instead, it leaves little doubt that whenever their Nouns follow-up does emerge, it will have been worth the wait.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13516-losing-feeling/,Sub Pop,2009.0,"If there's a band that knows how to rock the world with their unique style of music, it's No Age. With their newest release, ""Losing Feeling,"" they have once again proven that they are in a league of their own.

Before we jump into the album, let's take a moment to appreciate the story behind No Age. The band, consisting of Dean Spunt and Randy Randall, formed back in 2005 in Los Angeles, California. They quickly became the darlings of the indie rock scene with their dynamic and energetic live performances. Over the years, they have proven to be one of the most consistent and versatile bands out there.

""Losing Feeling"" was released in 2009 and features five songs that pack a punch. As soon as you press play, you can feel the tension building up with the opening track ""Losing Feeling."" The track is buzzing with energy and Randell's guitar riffs are electrifying. It's a great opening to the album, setting the tone for what's to come.

As the album progresses, we're treated to tracks like ""Genie"" and ""You're a Target,"" which are more experimental in their approach. No Age's fascination with noise and glitchy soundscapes is apparent throughout the album. It's a reminder of why they're one of the most innovative bands in the indie rock scene.

What's interesting about No Age's music is that it's both dark and hopeful at the same time. ""Aim at the Airport"" is the perfect example of this. The melancholic melody is contrasted by Spunt's lyrics that are reflective in nature. It's one of the standout tracks on the album, showcasing the band's ability to create a mood that's both introspective and uplifting.

Personally, I've always been a fan of No Age's music. When ""Losing Feeling"" was released, I was thrilled to hear that they had continued to push boundaries with their sound. The band's approach to music is like a breath of fresh air. While others are content with following a formulaic approach, No Age is not afraid to rebel against the norm. They're constantly experimenting and refining their sound, which is why they're one of my favorite bands out there.

In conclusion, ""Losing Feeling"" is a brilliant addition to No Age's discography. It's a reminder of why they're one of the most exciting bands in indie rock. The album is a journey that takes the listener on a ride through experimental and innovative sounds while still maintaining a sense of familiarity. With an 8.3 out of 10 rating, it's clear that others agree with me that this album is a must-listen for fans of the genre.","1.

Gucci Mane,Droptopwop,Rap,7.3,June 5 2017,Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,"Last summer, just two months after his release from a federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., Gucci Mane dropped his comeback album. The title made sense at the time: Everybody Looking. Already one of the most celebrated rappers of the century—a cult hero who had caught Billboard lightning a few times—the Atlantan’s profile had only risen while he was behind bars. The generation of rappers who owed Gucci their careers, either by borrowing his creative DNA or as one of his legions of mentees, had finally reached maturity and were dominating rap’s mainstream. Lean and sober, Gucci went on a charm offensive in the press, breaking bread with magazine editors and beaming on Snapchat. Everybody was looking, and Gucci was ready, mostly. Crucial in all this was that many were looking for the very first time. The thing about Gucci Mane’s work is that it’s best consumed in endless, bludgeoning waves. The jewelry appraisals and the re-up math and the latent paranoia are supposed to bleed into one another like an endless river. But the comeback album is supposed to be a Machiavellian statement of purpose, and *Everybody Looking *was weighed down by more than a few cobwebs. When the house lights came up, Gucci retreated back into his music to work out the kinks. Droptopwop, his full-length collaboration with Metro Boomin, is Gucci’s first post-prison project that truly gels. This is thanks in no small part to Metro, who Gucci had sought out for production when Metro was still in high school, who has since evolved into one of the genre’s most important architects. And while his reputation as a hitmaker has long been above reproach (he’s scored four top-ten hits in the past twelve months, including Migos’ “Bad and Boujee,” which hit No. 1), *Droptopwop now stands alongside the 21 Savage vehicle Savage Mode *as a testament to Metro’s skill as an auteur. The beats are spare and disquieting; “Finesse the Plug Interlude” sounds as if it’s playing out of a haunted Game Boy Color. “Dance With the Devil” is built on the shivers you feel when the feds are watching you as you watch your friends succumb to drug addiction, when you have unprotected sex and tremble in the clinic’s waiting room. And while “Met Gala,” which guest stars a furious Offset and includes assists from Southside and CuBeatz, is comprised of familiar parts, they’ve been arranged in a way that’s just a little bit foreign. Imagine hearing Flockaveli* *out of a passing car and then trying to describe it to someone who only speaks a little English. Though much has been made about Gucci’s radiant positivity, the truth is that he’s still working out fiercely, sometimes uncomfortably dark things in his music. “Helpless” plays around with the titular concept, throwing it into lighter contexts—into strip clubs—but the hook has a sinister subtext. “Tho Freestyle” pays tribute to fallen friends between gas station dead-drops and flying dope in on a drone. There are times, too, when Gucci’s sly sense of humor pokes through: On “Finesse” he raps, “I’m a shyster, I’m spiteful, and I love rifles/And I love white folks/I walk on a tightrope.” That last quote is the sort of thing Gucci does when he’s at his best: tightly-wound raps that betray a love of language, a comic’s sense of timing, a keen awareness about the way people see him, and the baggage of their preconceptions. *Droptopwop *is a worthwhile listen because Metro draws this out of his mentor by instinct, which makes for some of their most unhinged music in some time. So if you’ve tuned out since the welcome-home party, it might be time to start looking again.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23355-droptopwop/,Atlantic,2017.0,"If you're looking for a raw and gritty rap album, look no further than Gucci Mane's ""Droptopwop"". With a rating of 7.3 out of 10, this album is a must-listen for any rap fan who loves hard-hitting beats and powerful lyrics. In this review, we'll dive into the history of the band and the creation story of this album, as well as my personal experience listening to it.

Gucci Mane, whose real name is Radric Davis, is a rapper from Atlanta who has been in the game for more than a decade. He's known for his raw and unapologetic style, and he's collaborated with some of the biggest names in the industry, including Drake, Lil Wayne, and Nicki Minaj.

""Droptopwop"" was released in May 2017, and it was inspired in part by Gucci Mane's experiences in prison. In 2013, he was sentenced to 39 months in prison for firearm possession, and during his time behind bars, he began to focus on his music more intensely than ever before. He wrote, recorded, and released several albums while in prison, and ""Droptopwop"" is the first one he produced after his release.

The album is a collaboration with Metro Boomin, a producer from St. Louis who's worked with some of the biggest names in the industry, including Future, Kanye West, and Drake. Metro Boomin's beats are the perfect complement to Gucci Mane's gritty style, and together, they've created an album that's both hard-hitting and introspective.

From the opening track, ""5 Million Intro"", it's clear that this album is going to be a wild ride. Gucci Mane's flow is relentless, and Metro Boomin's trap beats are explosive. One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Finesse the Plug Interlude"", which features a sample from a classic Gucci Mane track and a verse from rapper Playboi Carti. It's a fast-paced track that's perfect for driving or working out.

However, the standout track on ""Droptopwop"" is undoubtedly ""Met Gala"", which features a guest verse from Offset, a member of the rap group Migos. The beat is slow and menacing, and Gucci Mane and Offset's flows seem to perfectly complement each other. It's a great collaboration that showcases the strengths of both rappers.

Overall, I would definitely recommend ""Droptopwop"" to any fan of rap music. It's a hard-hitting album that's perfect for anyone who loves trap beats and gritty lyrics. The collaboration between Gucci Mane and Metro Boomin is a great example of how two talented artists can come together to create something truly unique. With a rating of 7.3 out of 10, ""Droptopwop"" is definitely worth a listen.","1.

Crash of Rhinos,Knots,,8.1,July 31 2013,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"The title of Crash of Rhinos’ stunning second LP is taken from a list of stalemates-- “wasted nights, impasses and knots.” The Derby, UK, quintet spends the duration Knots trying to break through these deadlocks, and they start with anthemic single “Opener”. With equal parts anxious anticipation and relief, Ian Draper barks “you’re not wasting time” to his companion, embodying the stomach-in-knots feeling that pervades the record: the two are going to sleep together that night or never see each other again, but nothing’s going to be left unsaid this time. It’s a confrontational song about a confrontation and it’s almost impossible for hear it and remain a disinterested bystander. My first listen, I wanted to tear a phonebook in half. A colleague said it made her want to cry, “in a good way.” But the heart’s a muscle too, right? Make no mistake, Knots is emo as hell and a reminder that the term evolved from “emotional hardcore.” It’s an album of real stakes and bone-deep commitment, where any honest interaction, of mind, body, or soul, is preferably full-contact. The multifaceted construction of the band allows them to express themselves as both grounded and aspiring, a combination of Dischord’s stoic post-hardcore and the literate, heart-on-sleeve and girl crazy Midwestern emo of the mid-to-late 90s. Crash of Rhinos describe themselves as “five voices, two guitars, two basses, one drum kit,” adding, “we make a racket.” The roles are fluid, as drummer Oli Craven is just as likely to be foregrounded as any of the guitarists, while the overlap of steely, resonant lead vocals and unvarnished yelling result in both strident melodies and unorthodox harmonies. That’s a lot to keep track of and on their 2011 debut Distal, Crash of Rhinos occasionally lost the handle, a promising band a bit overwhelmed by their wealth of ideas. The songs on Knots unfold like brilliant football plays, utilizing synchronization, deception, quick cuts, speed and brawn, the individual players given omni-directional free reign for the larger purpose of forward momentum. “Opener” mirrors the dramatic conversation of its narrators where heavy emotions can no longer be expressed delicately and everything has to go right. All four guitars appear to strike out in different rhythms, yet churn forward by interlocking in their respective gaps and pauses. When “Opener” snaps into its pulverizing chorus, it puts the subtle restraint of Knots into sharp relief-- it’s the only time all five members appear to be acting in unison, and the force is devastating. Knots is often every bit as hooky following “Opener”, though rarely as condensed into radio-readiness. More than half of the songs here extend past five minutes to accommodate every four-bar tangent or drum fill accenting the band’s burly barstool poetry and dashboard confessionals. I imagine Crash of Rhinos are partial to semicolons, as Knots abides by its instructions: pause. Collect yourself. Go. The album’s bookends “Luck Has a Name” and “Speeds of Ocean Greyhounds”, are reverse images of each other, the former sprinting out and cycling through quicksilver time changes before settling into a patient build, while the latter starts out as a ballad before closing out Knots with a percussive victory lap. “Sum of All Parts” feigns itself as a mid-album, waltz-timed cool-down before a chorus of doubled vocals and guitars that lunges out of the speakers. There are two short guitar instrumentals-- acoustic fingerpicking exercise “Everything Is” and the ruminative “The Reason I Took So Long”-- and while beautiful in their own right, they’re the only points on Knots where Crash of Rhinos limit themselves to one thing. They both prove necessary in establishing continuity throughout Knots, as Crash of Rhinos get increasingly ambitious throughout. The first half acknowledges its debt to the bands that will draw in new listeners and nostalgists-- think a softer Fugazi, a musclebound version of tourmates Braid, …And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead,  anything J. Robbins has been involved with-- while Side B goes out into more audacious, free-form compositions. On “Mannheim”, they tease out the dissonant chords and oblong time signatures of their earlier work. “Standards & Practice” weaves two gracefully looping guitars for a melody too distinct to allow counterpoint-- instead, the band’s vocals clash in brassy, atonal harmonies like free jazz horns. You get the sense that Knots could be a standard in its current genre, but the exploratory second half suggests Crash of Rhinos are working towards transcending it. It’s that combination of potential and realization that gives Knots a spiritual connection to its lineage in addition to a sonic one. A UK band whose influences are entirely American, you can picture Crash of Rhinos watching YouTubes of old Fugazi and Braid shows and wishing they had something similar, where the communal expression was as meaningful for the crowd as the artist. The best of this stuff felt like it was perpetually on the verge, that something was at stake, and that’s where Knots finds the energy to answer its main philosophical challenge: Is fear stronger than your desire for emotional freedom? This is played out on centerpiece “Impasses”, where guitarist Richard Birkin screams “it could’ve been a waste of your time!” before the band spasms and double clutches, working up the courage to admit “it wasn’t a waste of mine!” It’s a raw moment, expressing the kind of sentiment that leaves one vulnerable and prone to embarrassment if it’s not reciprocated. There’s an undeniable catharsis in crossing that line as well and after that point, “Impasses” can never go back to being the tense and composed post-punk it presented itself as in the beginning. Instances like these make Knots feel vital. While indie rock still primarily traffics in timid sounds and mannered emotions, Crash of Rhinos dare to care too much on Knots and their risk is our reward*.*",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18357-crash-of-rhinos-knots/,"Big Scary Monsters,Top Shelf,To Lose La Track",2013.0,"If you're looking for a band that can harbor the raw energy and emotion of alternative rock while infusing it with an experimental edge, then look no further than Crash of Rhinos. Their 2013 album ""Knots"" is a prime example of why they have become a highly revered band in the nan genre.

To understand the impressive scope and creativity of this album, it's important to first understand the background of Crash of Rhinos. The band, founded in Derby, England, in 2009, consists of eight members who all boast their distinct musical talents. The group's vast array of experiences and perspectives blend together to create a truly unique and unforgettable sound.

The creative process behind ""Knots"" is equally intriguing. The album was recorded in a bar owned by the band members, adding a homey atmosphere to the production. This album was a true labor of love, with the band working tirelessly to perfect the tracks and deliver something truly special to their audience.

Upon listening to ""Knots,"" one is immediately struck by the sheer power of the music. Vocalist and guitarist Jim Cork has a voice that can effortlessly switch between explosive screams and heartfelt whispers. The instrumentation is intricate and dynamic, with each member shining on their respective instruments. The result is a sound that is both aggressive and introspective, with the band exploring the depths of humanity in their lyrics and melodies.

The album's opening track ""Luck Has A Name"" sets the tone perfectly, with its driving rhythm and intricate guitar riffs. ""Sum Of All Parts"" showcases the band's ability to build up to an explosive climax, while ""Opener"" is a masterclass in songwriting, featuring a catchy chorus and intricate composition.

One of the album's highlights is ""Interiors"", which displays the band's ability to let the music breathe and emphasize the lyrics. The track is a poignant reminder of the struggles of mental health and the importance of self-care.

Overall, ""Knots"" is an outstanding piece of art that showcases the vast range of abilities of Crash of Rhinos.

Dressy Bessy,Holler and Stomp,Rock,2.9,February 27 2009,David Raposa,Contributor,"When Dressy Bessy are good, Dressy Bessy are very, very good. They've excelled at the kind of head-bobbing tunes you'd expect from the Kindercore record label and, starting with their self-titled 2003 album, they also essayed the sort of enjoyable grrl-fronted rock that could fit right into a playlist between ""Seether"" and ""Bright Yellow Gun"". Throughout, Tammy Ealom's brash and giddy charm coupled with the group's way with a melody often won out over any objections. When they were not so good, Dressy Bessy exemplified what many would consider most obnoxious about both indiepop culture (the fetishistic and pointless appropriation of greasy kid stuff) and Ye Olde Elephant 6 collective (the fetishistic and pointless appropriation of 1960s psych-pop sounds and signifiers). But if the group could be accused of rubbing their pigtails in everyone's faces, even the grumpiest Gus would at the very least begrudge them their often inescapable hooks. But that would be before the group's latest album, Holler and Stomp. It's a 13-song journey through a world where Dressy Bessy turns themselves into everything critics thought they were-- amateurish, tuneless, puerile, purveyors of the sort of ""catchy"" songs that spring the CDC into action. It's as if the group chose to stoop to and limbo beneath the subterranean lows established by the awful cover portrait (with all due apologies to fans of the ""airbrushed street scene festooned with MS Paint graffiti and Oscar the Grouch trash cans"" school of artistry). Some might be more generous, but there are only two tunes that stand out from this mess for their non-awfulness. The album's nominal single, ""Simple Girlz"", features a sassy multi-tracked Ealom kicking up her walking boots in the general direction of shiftless dudes looking for easy breezy ladyfriends. The other track is ""Left to the Right"", a stop-start number where Dressy Bessy, which to this point of the album comes off as existing somewhere between ""listless"" and ""inert,"" sound like they're actually enjoying what they're playing. There's more than a bit of irony to be had, though, with Ealom repeatedly singing the line ""Gimme something to sing"" in a song that's all the better for keeping her singing to a minimum. Even the most casual listener would notice a change between Ealom's voice over the years-- her girlish chirp from the group's early days has developed a little husk and heft, making her sound not unlike Kim or Kelley Deal. On most of Holler and Stomp, unfortunately, she sounds like a Deal sister looking for a melody and a paper sack. It's bad enough that the songs, separate from the vocals, are pretty weak-- if the tunes on turds like ""Ease Me Down"" or ""Anyone Can See"" aren't bad enough, the use of cheesy Casio trumpets (on the former) or a rinky-dink drum machine (on the latter) make sure this shit stinks. Then Ealom shows up, slightly out of step with the songs in question, singing melodies she's seemingly forgotten tied to lyrics that are best left forgotten. Her performances comes off as awkward karaoke, and it's even worse when it comes on songs like ""Automatic"" or ""Sindy Says"" that superficially resemble what the group's done in the past (and done better). If the future promises to bring more moments where Tammy Ealom croaks ""I want to steal your candy"" like a nic-fitted Wicked Witch, then it's probably time for folks to stow Dressy Bessy in the attic.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12713-holler-and-stomp/,Transdreamer,2008.0,"If you're a fan of rock music, then Dressy Bessy's new album 'Holler and Stomp' might have landed on your radar. With a rock rating of 2.9 out of 10, it's not exactly blowing the charts away, but there's something about Dressy Bessy's new music that will keep listeners lingering.

First, let's talk about the band's history. Hailing from Denver, Dressy Bessy is a band that's been around since 1996. Even though they've been around for a while, you may not have heard of them before. But don't let their relatively unknown status turn you off. They've gained a cult following over the years with their hypnotic blend of garage, punk and pop music.

Now, on to the album. 'Holler and Stomp' was created with a rock rating of 2.9 out of 10, which may turn some off. However, don't let that deter you from giving this album a chance. It offers a unique and refreshing take on the rock genre, keeping true to Dressy Bessy's punk-pop influences.

One aspect that stands out in this album is its production. The crisp and clear production values give the songs a polished feeling, and the arrangements are creative and unexpected. The band's musicianship is top-notch, and they showcase their versatility with a range of tempos and styles.

While some may find the album lacking in heaviness or aggression, it more than makes up for it with its catchy melodies and inescapable hooks. You'll find yourself humming along to the tunes long after you've turned off the album.

The vocals are another standout element of the album. They're energetic and charismatic, and they carry a sense of fun and vibrant personality. They bring life to the music, with each song feeling like its own distinct entity.

In terms of personal experience, I particularly enjoyed the tracks ""Pop 30"" and ""It Happens Anyway"". These tracks stood out to me due to their infectious beats and rousing choruses. But, opinions differ and tracks that may resonate with me may not with you.

In conclusion, 'Holler and Stomp' may not be the heaviest or most aggressive rock album out there, but it's certainly worth a listen. Fans of punk and pop music will appreciate Dressy Bessy's unique take on the genre, and the album's catchy hooks will have you singing along in no time. So give it a shot - you may be surprised at how much you enjoy it.","1. Review A uses more complex and varied vocabulary, while Review B is more straightforward and simplified.

Onyx Collective ,Lower East Suite Part Three,Jazz,7.6,June 22 2018,Jay Balfour,Contributor,"Over the last couple of years, Onyx Collective have been playing a game of connect-the-dots across New York. The amorphous jazz ensemble is led primarily by the twentysomething saxophonist Isaiah Barr and drummer Austin Williamson, and in varying lineups they play DIY shows, rap concerts, jazz showcases, and funk jams. Throughout it all, they’ve become known for their itching curiosity, radical eagerness, and unconventional methods. Last year, Onyx Collective released a pair of EPs captured on an iPhone at gigs and practice spaces around Manhattan. The recordings’ immediacy was evocative, even though both the compositions and sound quality were rough around the edges. Still, the tactic captured a band excitingly on the move. On Lower East Suite Part One they jammed dense hard bop and salsa on the same tracklist. The series finale, Lower East Suite Part Three, is a determined change of pace and length, and the band sounds suddenly contained and focused. On the prequel EPs the band engaged with New York in documentary fashion, capsulizing their roaming performances with song titles like “172 Forsyth St.” and “Market St.” This time they begin fleshing out the narrative with commentary: “Battle of the Bowery,” “There Goes the Neighborhood,” “Eviction Notice.” Onyx Collective are still closely tuned to the buzz of the Lower East Side, but they’re conjuring and considering it abstractly instead of plugging directly into its hum. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York,” Barr has said. In many ways Lower East Suite Part Three is the sound of the musicians digging their heels in to pivot. For one thing, Part Three sounds much better. The songs are more linear and of a piece: dank bop compositions that often gnarl up in the middle and leave no room for extended solos. The pace and form of their songs no longer springs from jams, and there’s new tension and spacing to show for it. On “Rumble in Chatham Square” Barr’s tenor sax and Walter Stinson’s bass tiptoe along in cinematic staccato, Williamson tumbling behind them with flourishes and splashing accents. About halfway in, Barr staggers one way and Stinson the other, abruptly falling out of unison in a syncopated gait, as if to convey the namesake square in Chinatown, where a bunch of large streets jut into each other awkwardly and then resolve the intersection. “There Goes the Neighborhood” is a sleazy detective soundtrack. Barr’s sax swoops around in long, drunken strides, Stinson’s bass holding tight to stretch things back and together. There’s a playfulness to Barr’s horn throughout, but the album is foreboding and dense as a whole. “Magic Gallery” sounds a little cautious and precarious, but it’s one of the few places on the record where the band opens up space for Barr to swing gracefully instead of getting cornered. One of the highlights of Lower East Suite Part Three is the appearance of saxophonist Roy Nathanson, who, in his sixties, could be an Onyx Collective dad. Just a few years ago, Nathanson, an accomplished bandleader, composer, and session player himself, was Barr’s high-school teacher and an early musical mentor. On “Eviction Notice” you can hear him play the part of the tenant, trading blows with his apprentice—screaming frantic, squiggly squeals on his way out the door while Barr bellows out landlord-like groans underneath. It’s the most obvious set piece on the record, a passionate shouting match and existential crisis that ends with dramatic, raucous discord. A little over a decade ago, an interviewer asked Nathanson, a Brooklynite who in the early 1980s wrote a song called “Spirits of Flatbush,” if he could have found his  artistic voice anywhere else in the United States. “No,” he said, noting how deeply the era’s East Village scene was grounded in a sense of place. “It wasn’t like I just visited New York, my roots were so Brooklyn.” On a song like “Eviction Notice” you can hear how much things have changed, as Onyx Collective grapple with how to belong to a city they’re from, but won’t get to inherit. Correction: An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that this was a studio recording; the album was recorded at a gallery.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/onyx-collective-lower-east-suite-part-three/,Big Dada,2018.0,"Lower East Suite Part Three, the latest album by Onyx Collective, is a captivating offering that is sure to impress jazz enthusiasts and music lovers alike. With a rating of 7.6 out of 10, it is clear that the music is a force to be reckoned with in contemporary jazz.

Onyx Collective, consisting of some of the most talented young jazz musicians from New York, has made a name for itself with its unique blend of jazz, punk, and funk. Their sound is influenced by the music of artists such as John Coltrane, Sun Ra, and Ornette Coleman, but they have managed to create their own distinct style that sets them apart from other jazz bands.

The album, Lower East Suite Part Three, is the third in a series of albums by the band that are inspired by their home neighborhood of Lower East Side, Manhattan. The album is a tribute to the vibrant energy and spirit of the area, and the band's love and appreciation for their hometown shines through in every track.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Battle of the Bowery,"" which features a fast-paced, frenetic saxophone solo by band leader Isaiah Barr. The track is a nod to the historic Bowery music scene of the 1970s and 80s, where punk and jazz musicians performed in the same venues.

Another standout track is ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"" a soulful and emotional rendition of the classic folk song made famous by Roberta Flack. The track features guest vocals by Nick Hakim, who adds his own unique touch to the song.

Throughout the album, Onyx Collective demonstrates their impeccable musicianship and ability to seamlessly blend different genres and influences into one cohesive sound. There is a sense of improvisation and spontaneity in their music that keeps the listener engaged and invested from start to finish.

Personally, as a jazz enthusiast and lover of music in general, I found Lower East Suite Part Three to be an absolute joy to listen to. The band's ability to take traditional jazz elements and infuse them with their own unique style and energy is truly impressive. The album is a testament to the band's talent and creativity and is not to be missed.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Lower East Suite Part Three by Onyx Collective to anyone looking for a fresh take on jazz and an exceptional listening experience. If you're looking for an album that is both dynamic and emotional, then look no further than this offering by one of the most exciting jazz bands of our time.","1.

Diplo,Favela Strikes Back,Electronic,7.5,June 29 2005,Nick Sylvester,Contributor,"I haven't done the first graf kinda-sorta relevant anecdote bit in a while (or the meta thing), so forgive me: During my two month riff in Rome, I sacked the eternal city for the real what have you's-- what real Italians wear, where real Italians hang out at night, how real Italians ride real Italian scooters. Three-button collared party shirts are the hot shit, but one arm in I realized I didn't have the chest hair. So the rest of the summer I stuck to wearing ""I Survived the Pantheon"" tees and having my wallet stolen-- tourist stuff, comfortable but me. Diplo does the tourist thing too-- obviously there's some give/take w/r/t how much control he has over that-- but beginning-to-end he approaches baile funk with, vaguely we'll say, hip-hop sensibilities. (Or better, Hollertronix sensibilities, where bass, Dirty South, Baltimore, and ""Sweet Dreams"", among others, peacefully co-exist.) Baile funk aka favela funk aka funk has been doing the crazy Portuguese screaming over Miami bass and U.S. pop kitsch thing for decades now-- we're just finding out about it. The tracks we're hearing on Diplo's through-the-backdoor mixes (his first trip to Brazil yielded last year's Favela On Blast) aren't necessarily groundbreaking or definitive for the genre (how would we know?), just the ones off Diplo's Rio-bought comps he thought people'd dig. He liked the stuff simply by how it sounded-- imagine that. Track 5 (no song titles; more re: that in a sec) snatches something from Grease, I think, and throws it back hi-ho silver digital cowboy, etc. Then there's a part where all these dogs start barking-- always glad to hear some of that. The sixth track has James Brown breaks, which I don't remember from the other comps, so that's cool, and track 11 has a Prodigy line on it. Track 15 samples a song I'm probably supposed to know; it's OK. Other songs you may have heard in parts on Diplo's criminally overlooked Piracy Funds Terrorism Vol. 1 mixtape, which he put together with Sri Lankan-via-London artist-singer M.I.A.. Which makes me wonder: If there are baile tracks that we're hearing and saying ""Oh, this is an old one,"" I can only imagine how these tracks fit into a current Rio set. Elsewhere there's all the hora, rinkydink Italian wedding carmina, and crazy sing-scream MCs whose sound falls somewhere between dancehall toasters and the grime kids. Baile funk is ""make do with what you got"" music-- it's a fun dance at best (and worst), hardly self-conscious to my ears, raw and celebratory in that amateur talent/lotta heart way whose spirit-- kill me-- I find strangely kin to the good-precious side of American indie. And god I hate to bring this up but: While there's some dubiously transferrable hip-hop morality at work here with mixtapes copping songs that themselves copped songs, Diplo's on some honest-to-badness culture-vulture shit that understandably rubs dudes the wrong way. Worse, his no artist/no song title thing might trick people into thinking ""It all sounds the same to Diplo, he's overgeneralizing!"", which I think reflects more on the accuser than the accused. But 10 wrongs do make five rights, and if Diplo's shtick is bringing this shanty to the world in a way they might respond to and ultimately might take vested interest in (read: $$$), then let's drop the charges for now and indulge the music as wide-eyed as he does.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2571-favela-strikes-back/,Self-released,2005.0,"If you're searching for a record that will take you on a journey, then look no further than Diplo's latest release, Favela Strikes Back. The acclaimed producer's fourth album is a sonic adventure through the vibrant favelas of Brazil, with its lush rhythms, captivating beats, and mesmerizing melodies.

Diplo's journey to crafting this record is as interesting as the music itself. Diplo, a lauded electronic music artist, has a history of concocting playful, infectious tracks that balance equal amounts of irreverence and catchiness. However, for Favela Strikes Back, Diplo took a path away from his earlier work and leaned into the sounds and cultures of Brazil. The album isn't only inspired by Brazilian music but collaborates with local musicians, bringing to the forefront a lesser-known corner of the dance music world.

From the opening track, ""Favela Rave,"" Favela Strikes Back immerses listeners in the colorful sounds of Brazil. The song encapsulates the essence of the album, providing a blend of carnival-esque percussion, tribal vocals, and whirling rhythms. Diplo never loses his focus on the electronic roots, though, which keep the record festive and lively, ideal for moving your feet to the beat.

One of the record's standout tracks is ""Sweet Dreams,"" featuring Brazilian singer and songwriter Mc Lan. When the track hits the chorus, the sound explodes with robust, rhythm-heavy drops that are countered by a slow-moving beat. Mc Lan brings a sparkling energy to the track, adding to the already vivacious sound.

The record closes with its title track, ""Favela Strikes Back,"" a fitting ending to an album that has taken its listeners on a sonic journey through the streets of Brazil. The track's bass-heavy rhythms, swelling synths, and pensive strings perfectly intersect, creating a dynamic and moving endpiece.

Overall, Favela Strikes Back is an album that should have a wide appeal to people who love dance music with an electronic edge, but especially those who are looking for something fresh and new. Diplo expertly blends genres and regions, making Favela Strikes Back a colorful and captivating listen. It's not perfect, but that's what makes it so appealing. It is something different but familiar, and that balance is what makes this record an excellent addition to Diplo's already impressive discography.","1.

Johanna Warren,Gemini II,Folk/Country,7.0,February 24 2018,Sam Sodomsky,Associate Staff Writer,"Johanna Warren sometimes seems like a psychic medium moonlighting as a songwriter. The Portland native makes dreamy folk music that sparkles and sprawls with new age flourishes and crystal shop percussion, inspired by tarot cards, metaphysics, and the monastic teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh. Even beyond her recorded work, Warren comes off like a person radiating with cosmic wisdom to the point that it starts leaking outward, seemingly unprompted. In an interview at SXSW last year, she offered this advice: “If you just make yourself really bright and shiny, everything around you becomes a reflective surface that shines back at you.” (The question she’s responding to—“How’s your South By experience so far?”). Gemini II is the second album Johanna Warren has composed about a relationship (with a Gemini), and it mirrors its predecessor. Both feature nine interlinked songs, with Warren playing a wide variety of instruments including guitar, flute, mellotron, and synths. While the concept views love through an astrological lens, her lyrics expose life’s crushing banality—the things that make us look to the stars for answers in the first place. In “Cause or Effect,” she sings to a protagonist left bored and self-conscious when everyone at the party steps out for a smoke. “You got nothing else to do/Your phone is broken,” she sings as a rush of harmony enters, as if to mock the weight of such unglamorous ennui. While recording prolifically as a solo artist, Warren has also developed a career accompanying folks like Julie Byrne and Iron & Wine, acts who’ve gained notoriety for just how unaccompanied their music sounds. You get the sense that Warren’s become a sought-after collaborator not for her ability to blend into the background but for her knowledge of exactly how to complement a song while maintaining its sense of solitude, tapping into an inherent aura. This skill makes the relatively brief Gemini II feel dynamic and sweeping and its songs consistently surprising. In the moody opener, “Hopelessness Has Done Nothing For Me,” Warren textures a date night pep talk with gothic cobwebs of piano and guitar. When the drums kick in, they conjure the rush of road-trip indie rock, a subtle gust of familiarity and momentum. More straightforward songs like the strum-along ballad “Boundaries” also move in strange ways. With a melody that finds the middle ground between Red House Painters’ Songs for a Blue Guitar and Taylor Swift’s Speak Now, Warren breaks in and out of character, injecting its sense of calm with conversational asides. You are unlikely to hear a more beautiful song that also includes the phrase, “so fucking stoked.” Both as a guitarist and a vocalist, Warren has a knack for complex, unwinding melodies. The subtle “Mine to Take,” with its weary double-tracked vocals, taps into the mystical Laurel Canyon sound of Judee Sill. British folk serves as an inspiration for the more ambitious compositions: the hypnotic “inreverse” and the closing “Was It Heaven.” Wise and stately, these songs provide the album’s major moments of resolution. “I hope you’ll fly again,” Warren sings in the closing lines of “Was It Heaven.” “With you, I was infinitely lost.” As the departing sentiment of her Gemini saga, it offers a sense of peace, but Warren knows most journeys don’t end so clean. We never stop searching for answers: It’s what keeps all our most trusted songwriters—and psychics—in business.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/johanna-warren-gemini-ii/,Spirit House ,2018.0,"Gemini II by Johanna Warren – A Folksy & Country-Infused Delight

For fans of the folksy and country-infused genre, the latest musical offering from Johanna Warren, Gemini II, is a treat for sore ears. With a rating of 7.0 out of 10, the album takes listeners on a journey through powerful melodies and honest, emotive lyrics that are sure to leave a lasting impact.

Johanna Warren is not a newcomer to the music scene. Hailing from Portland, Oregon, she has been active in the industry since the early 2010s. Her music has always displayed a high level of raw honesty and emotional depth, but her latest release takes her artistry even further.

The creation story of this album is worth mentioning. Johanna started writing most of these songs while living in LA, feeling the need to create something out of the pain she experienced during her stay there. The songs took on a life of their own, each one reflecting the emotional state of mind she was in at the time. The album was recorded at a studio in Tucson and features backup from musicians who share her creative vision.

Gemini II is an album filled with powerful reflections on life, love, and self-growth. The opening track, ""Twisted,"" sets the stage with a slow, haunting melody and introspective lyrics. The title track, ""Gemini II,"" is a personal declaration of self-discovery and acceptance, with a beautiful blend of violins and harmonies. ""Inreverse"" is another standout track, with powerful lyrics capturing the essence of letting go.

The sound of the album is classic folksy country, with acoustic instruments being the prominent force throughout. The production and mixing of the album are impressive, achieving a high level of clarity and balance while still retaining the raw, unpolished sound that gives the album its organic feel.

Overall, Gemini II is an album that hits hard, tugging on the heartstrings with ease. For anyone who loves the sounds of folk and country, this album is an excellent choice. While not perfect, it offers a glimpse of the raw talent and emotional depth of an artist who is deserving of greater recognition.

As a fan of folk and country music myself, I found myself pleasantly surprised by Johanna Warren's latest offering. It is a beautiful and nuanced work, full of conviction and emotion, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great album to add to their collection.","1.

The Belle Game,Ritual Tradition Habit,,7.2,August 9 2013,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Consider the following: Arcade Fire, Broken Social Scene, Feist, Grizzly Bear. I don’t think it’s much of a stretch to assume you either like these bands or at least are willing to acknowledge them as the ruling class of no-qualifiers indie rock. Now, what if you saw that list on someone’s dating profile? Would you have a positive impression of this person? Conversely, what if a band used that list to point out their primary influences? Would you have a negative impression of this band? Would you consider them frontrunners or unambitious or lacking curiosity? They should at least be able to play the game and acknowledge Berlin-era Bowie or mid-90s Mariah Carey, right? The Belle Game aren’t trying to fool anyone: those are the influences slapped on their Facebook page and Ritual Tradition Habit proudly manifests the effect those bands had on the Vancouver quintet. But while Belle Game have taken a lot of cues from the sound of those bands, more importantly, they aspire to the ideal of being a critical and popular darling without sounding cool-- Ritual is unerringly tuneful and tasteful, with confident vocals, meticulous craftsmanship and no fear of being seen as middlebrow. In short, it could’ve come out any time in the past decade and sound just as good as it does in 2013. The irony is that Ritual is something of a grower as a result of being so familiar. You might think you have “River” and “Wait Up For You” pegged within their first minute. Free of context, the choruses broad pleas based on their titles, “I’ve been your river since we were kids,” “I’ll wait up for you.” “River” begins with a waltz-timed flurry of chalkdust guitars that have to be from a Walkmen song you can’t quite recall; the intro of “Wait Up For You” is so reminiscent of Fleet Foxes’ “Ragged Wood” that you might just sing the “whoooooooa!” harmonies out of habit. Any skepticism or accusations of theft are done away with pretty quickly, as singer Andrea Lo is the opposite of a “secret weapon,"" more of a demonstration of just how rare a commanding, powerful vocal presence is in this realm. It isn’t long before “River” and “Wait Up For You” generate enough velocity for liftoff, and the choruses don’t explode so much as slowly levitate and expand with Lo’s vocals guiding the way. No amount of artfully scuffed filters or small-screen production touches can hide that Lo’s a performer through and through, someone who could just as easily have been an R&B powerhouse or at least doing some off Broadway material. For all the sonic immediacy, it doesn’t take much digging to get to Ritual’s dark roots. The chorus of “River” uses its titular metaphor in a disturbing way-- Lo empathizes with a place where bodies and secrets are dumped. “Wait Up For You” might sound like breathless infatuation, but the narrator appears to be at the mercy of a drunk lover or an absentee father, where the waiting is futile and endless. Lo’s lyrics are in such plainspoken language and the music so instantly accessible that you can easily miss Ritual dealing entirely in the wages of sin: prostitution, abuse, heartbreak, the list goes on. It’s hardly alone in its occasional Fleetwood Mac worship, but more than most bands, Belle Game zeroes in on the codependency and desperation in the lyrics. Still, nearly everything here gives you a brief glimpse of who they could possibly open for in the upcoming months. As with “River” and “Wait Up For You”, many songs here could pass for a populist indie version of what the Field did on From Here We Go Sublime, in reverse; the “reveal” of the source material happens at the beginning rather than the end. You’ll catch the clacking rhythms and broad harmonies of early Local Natives (“Wasted Light”, “Blame Fiction”), skeletal guitar figures cloaked in reverb a la the xx and airy vocal runs taken from various Beach House songs. They gamely cover their tracks by making good on their “dark-pop” descriptor: “In Secrets” incorporates an intense orchestral swell more reminiscent of Montreal’s late-90s post-rock than its mid-00s indie, while “Salt + Water” is caked with oxidized distortion. Less convicing are the three interludes which intend to give the record some conceptual framework (“Ritual”, “Tradition”, “Habit”), but end up stunting its momentum instead. Ritual ultimately brings to mind some phrase whose source I can't recall, it could've been a famous musician or just someone at a party: “it’s really easy for a band to be unpopular.” It’s a variant on poptimism, an acknowledgment that screaming over guitar ran through five effects pedals isn’t necessarily easier than writing a three-chord jingle. Belle Game shouldn’t be commended just because they’re not trying to be an improvisational noise band or what have you. But there is something weirdly daring about Ritual-- there’s no narrative, no currency, just an arguably naïve trust that they can draw you in with familiarity and let the strength of the musicianship and the depth of the lyrics win the day. It’s especially charming as the O.C. celebrates its 10th anniversary and causes many of us to look back with both warm nostalgia and a twinge of embarrassment at a time when polite, melodic and sync-able indie rock was indie rock. And for the most part it works; the fact that Ritual would sound good had it come out in 2004, 2008 or 2010 means it’s going to sound good in 2014 and beyond.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18403-the-belle-game-ritual-tradition-habit/,Boompa,2013.0,"Allow me to introduce you to The Belle Game and their album, Ritual Tradition Habit. If you're a fan of indie rock music, then you should definitely get around their work. The band has been making waves in the music scene for over a decade now, and they have come a long way since their humble beginnings in Vancouver, Canada.

The Belle Game consists of six members, each one bringing their unique talent to the mix. And it shows. This album is a masterpiece in terms of composition, production, and even the way it was released. You see, the band members decided to self-produce this album, which was a bold move, but one that paid off. They took their time, focused on their vision, and came up with something truly remarkable.

Ritual Tradition Habit is one of those albums that you can listen to multiple times and still find something new to love. It's a perfect blend of indie rock and electronica, with just the right amount of experimentation. The album's opening track, ""Ritual,"" sets the tone and takes you on a sonic journey. It's cinematic, dreamy, and captivating all at once.

As the album progresses, you can feel the band's evolution. The songs become more complex, the use of instrumentation and production techniques more ambitious. One standout track is ""River,"" which showcases Andrea Lo's hauntingly beautiful voice, as well as the band's ability to create an immersive sonic environment.

The Belle Game has created an album that takes risks, but always feels authentic. They've created something that feels true to their roots while still pushing the boundaries of what indie rock can be. And it's all thanks to the band's dedication to their craft.

But, this album is not without its flaws. There are a few tracks that feel a bit too repetitive or meandering, but those moments are few and far between. And overall, the album is an experience, one that I highly recommend.

In conclusion, Ritual Tradition Habit is a sonic journey worth taking. It's an album that shows the growth and dedication of a talented group of musicians. And, it's an album that deserves to be listened to and appreciated. With a rating of 7.2 out of 10, The Belle Game has really outdone themselves with this one.","1.

Their pastoral music is a smoothie-laden jaunt through the Illini prairie grasslands with your feet listlessly dangling from the passenger side window of your Toureg as you head to the state fair or garage sale or marshmallow sunflower festival. At least that used to be the case. It seems Nick Franglen and Fred Deakin have changed tonal locales, aligning their temperances with the metropolitan. If Lost Horizons was a tryst through a glorious, luminescent countryside, then '64-'95 is the shiftless subway car careening through midtown streets and echoing throughout forgotten, bi-tonal alleys. The country mouse pawns his acoustic guitar for an Ibanez and ditches his walking stick for a Zipcar. With little more than the forgetful ramblings of an elderly man on the intro, ""'88 aka Come Down on Me"" sounds like the background music for mid-90s airplane crime dramas like ConAir or Turbulence-- the ones that always have that squealing White Zombie song in the background. Fortunately, this piece is an anomaly. '64-'95 succeeds when Lemon Jelly stick to their bread and butter: pleasant and facile ambience. ""Make Things Right"" carries a wistful, dignified elegance with its melodious guitar track. When they embark on other journeys, the results feel forced. Tracks like ""Don't Stop Now"" and dance-y ""Stay With You"" feel as sensual as silk-shirted muscleman at overpriced bar whispering in your ear. And ""The Shouty Track"" is as annoying as the five-minute training tape for irritable parents on my desk from National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome. Lemon Jelly stood out from the Thievery Corporations and Amon Tobins by creating something wonderful and energetic. They excelled at painting beauty but apparently have become victims of the city's stealth and sloth. Having discarded layering and complication for realms more well-rehearsed, '64-'95 feels like a postcard from a tourist rather than the urban autobiographies that DJ Shadow and RjD2 are able to so masterfully cohere. Fortunately, there is considerable significance in the album's final track ""Go"". Flighty and driving, Lemon Jelly perhaps will take all they've learned from the metropolis to embark for higher ground, maybe walking tall like Bunyan's Christian from Vanity Fair, wiser and bolder from the knowledge of the city.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4728-65-95/,XL,2005.0,"Lemon Jelly's '65-'95' is not your ordinary album; it's an intricately woven tapestry of electronic and jazz elements that weave together to tell a story. If I had to sum up this album in one word, it would be ""nostalgic."" 

The two-man band has a rich history in the UK electronic music scene, having released music for more than two decades. Their music often draws on samples, beats, and obscure sound bites, with synthesizers and jazz elements supporting their rich fusions. You can't help but miss the earlier days of electronic music when you listen to Lemon Jelly, and that's exactly what the '65-'95' album illustrates best.

This album, in particular, is a journey down memory lane, spanning the years between 1965 and 1995. It's as if Lemon Jelly is trying to recapture a lost essence of British music from those years, bringing it to life through their unique electronic interpretation. It's an odd mix of nostalgia and modernity, and it works to perfection.

Every song on the album is a journey unto itself. Some of the tracks, such as ""Page One"" and ""The Staunton Lick,"" are lively, upbeat, and danceable. Others, such as ""Homage to Patagonia"" and ""His Majesty King Raam,"" are more contemplative and evoke a sense of longing. Throughout the album, the electronic beats, synths, and jazz instruments all come together to create an eclectic mash-up of sounds that are both familiar and new.

The album's production is top-notch, with each track flowing seamlessly into the next. The tracks are layered with depth and meaning, creating a listening experience that is never boring, despite the album's length. The use of samples and sound design is very creative too.

Throughout this album, I often found myself feeling sentimental and nostalgic for a time I never actually experienced. The band's use of samples creates a sense of familiarity and warmth, making it easy to get lost in the music.

However, despite the unique mix of electronic and jazz, I couldn't help but feel like the album was missing something. Some of the tracks felt a bit repetitive and lacked a certain spark that would have made them more memorable. While it's definitely an enjoyable listen, it doesn't quite reach the heights of other classic electronic and jazz albums.

In conclusion, Lemon Jelly's '65-'95' is a solid album that fans of the genre will undoubtedly appreciate. It's a journey through time and British music that is both unique and nostalgic. While it may not be the band's strongest work, it is a great example of their creativity and artistry. If you're looking for an album to get lost in, to reminisce about a different time, Lemon Jelly's '65-'95' is definitely worth a listen.","Step 1: Review A has a more informal tone and includes personal anecdotes, while Review B is more objective and focused on describing the music itself.

Masta Killa,No Said Date,Rap,8.3,August 18 2004,Sam Ubl,,"Over the foreboding intro of the aptly titled ""Triumph"", the Wu-Tang Clan's single biggest commercial splash, a bumbling, typically incoherent Ol' Dirty Bastard invites the listener to follow him and the gang ""back to '79."" Inspectah Deck then spits one of the group's most memorable verses (""I bomb atomically...""), inaugurating a nearly 6-minute string of relentless wordplay featuring nearly every Wu member in top form. While the Wu solo records of the last seven years have occasionally been retrograde, none of it has been expressly retro in sound or spirit. In fact, since 1997, the group has mired in stasis, presiding over an uneven spate of generally lackluster solo albums and a pair of underwhelming group efforts; ODB's call has been taken in vain. There were periodic beacons of hope, but nothing that ever materialized into broader success for the group. GZA's excellent 2002 release, Legend of the Liquid Sword, eulogized its roots in both NYC and the Far East with sly mainstream appeal and poignant autobiographical lyrics, reverently pushing the envelope forward like no Clansman since Raekwon on Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. But other members' stabs at innovation have either been too far-flung for mainstream ears or too uneven to make a lasting impression. Ghostface's caustic, free-flown verses have been reliably ferocious, but even his 2000 classic Supreme Clientele was too blowhard to fit in alongside fellow members' more group-minded efforts. Method Man has declined, RZA has branched out in non-hip-hop endeavors, and Ol' Dirty has simply embarrassed. None of this has boded well for the marginal ninth member of the Clan, Masta Killa, whose presence in the group has been enigmatic at best. Adding to the inauspiciousness is the fact that No Said Date, his inaugural solo endeavor, marks something of a milestone for Wu Tang: Masta is the last Clan member to count a solo album to his credit. From his diminutive (though deceptively strong) performances on group issues such as 2001's Iron Flag, there was little basis from which to expect anything, one way or the other, from Masta-- which is why his stealing the spotlight with the most fully formed Wu solo effort this year comes as such a surprise. No Said Date is by no means an entirely new outing; many of its tracks have been cocooned for several years, patiently ripening in the 36 Chambers' dankest crevasses, and No Said Date's opportune release-- in the smack-dab middle of a disconcertingly weak year for Wu-- makes its anachronous vibe all the more vital. That these songs sound pungently old fashioned is no mistake: RZA's production is markedly pared-down from more mainstream-minded Wu solo material, and Masta's verses benefit from this unpretentiousness. The record succeeds on modesty, not reticence; Masta is a rapper's rapper, forsaking high-flown gimmicks for Spartan flows and carefully considered rhymes. His accent isn't as instantly identifiable as RZA's or Method Man's, but Masta's bulwark is rote verbal skill, the kind often shunned for higher targets like aesthetic appeal, production novelty, and uncouth humor. No Said Date packs those elements as well, but in a subtle, refined manner that never upstages the album's focal point: its lyrics. While devotees may hear this as a back-to-basics approach for Wu Tang (Masta himself has even vowed to ""[bring] back that original Wu-Tang sound""), No Said Date owns its share of decisively forward-looking tracks: ""Digi-Warfare"", with its housey electronics and lusty vocal intonations, could be mistaken for a Basement Jaxx remix, while ""The Future"" literally teleports decades yonder, handing the mic over to a trio of pre-teen MCs, whose breathless verses rival Ghostface among Clan members in their horrific violence. (Its instrumental track is also one of No Said Date's tightest, though several songs vie for that title.) That ""The Future"" is considered a skit in the liner notes is a testament to the record's depth. Masta wisely eschews tedious humor sketches, typically taking a more serious bent. But unlike his contemporaries who make up the so-called conscientious school (Talib and Dilated Peoples are guilty), his gravity is never dogmatic. The title track derives most of its weightiness from a determined beat that samples strings from OutKast's ""Skrew It On the Bar-B"", while ""School"" features fluid, appropriately self-conscious lyrics (""Banging on the lunchroom table, I used to speculate/ And watch some of the MC greats throw verses back and forth/ I didn't have the heart to step forth"") over a particularly austere beat. Though explicitly old-school in approach, Wu-Tang could never have sounded this tight and direct 11 years ago on 36 Chambers; the technological just wasn't there. But Masta Killa has delivered one the most urgent, straightforward Wu releases since the group's debut over a decade ago. Maybe it's just refreshing to hear a Clansman whose head hasn't grown swollen yet, but the man at the top of the Wu food chain in 2004 happens to be the group's quietest. Hopefully, Masta's fellow members will take his queue.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5605-no-said-date/,Nature Sounds,2004.0,"If you're a fan of rap music, then you've probably heard of Masta Killa, a respected member of the legendary Wu-Tang Clan. Masta Killa's debut solo album, No Said Date, is a solid and impressive addition to his already impressive discography, showcasing his impeccable flow, clever lyrics, and tight production skills. With a rating of 8.3 out of 10, this album is not to be missed.

No Said Date was produced by Method Man and RZA, two of the most talented musicians in the Wu-Tang Clan. It was released in 2004, almost a decade after Masta Killa joined the legendary rap group, and it shows that he had been perfecting his craft during that time. The album's creation story is a fascinating one, as Masta Killa took his time and put so much effort and passion into the project. He wanted to make sure that every track on the album was perfect, so he took his time and recorded each song multiple times until he was satisfied with the result.

The album's nineteen tracks are a perfect showcase for Masta Killa's unique style, which combines witty lyrics, smooth flow, and intricate rhyme schemes. The album's first single, ""Old Man"", is an example of Masta Killa's ability to tell vivid stories about people and their experiences, while ""Silverbacks"" is an upbeat, danceable song that showcases Masta Killa's charisma and energy.

However, the album's standout track is the emotional and introspective ""D.T.D."", in which Masta Killa explores his struggles with addiction and his journey towards recovery. The track is a poignant reminder of the power of music and how it can help us confront our deepest fears and insecurities.

No Said Date is a true classic, and a testament to Masta Killa's talents as a writer, rapper, and producer. The album's themes of perseverance, resilience, and triumph over adversity are universal, and it speaks to the power of music in our lives. Whether you're a longtime fan of rap music or just discovering Masta Killa for the first time, No Said Date is a must-listen album that will leave you feeling inspired and uplifted.

People Under the Stairs,O.S.T.,"Jazz,Rap",7.7,September 2 2002,Sam Chennault,,"In the liner notes for O.S.T., People Under the Stairs producer/emcee Thes One provides a well-articulated manifesto where he defines the duo's sound as ""just good old hip-hop."" He further goes on to say that ""somewhere along the way it seems most critics decided that just making hip-hop was not good enough, and praises were hailed upon those who were 'experimental' and 'progressive'... [and] underground hip-hop became a symbol of suburban rebellion across the Internet."" This is an interesting point that reflects a growing divide within the independent/underground hip-hop community. Although hip-hop has never been aesthetically homogeneous, the curtain rift between old and new threatens divide the genre into two distinctively different sounds: The artists associated with Anticon and Warp Records' hip-hop imprint Lex press hip-hop's sound forward at an unrelenting speed that has critics heralding the emergence of a new era. While these artists wage war with their machines in suburban basements, another faction within the hip-hop community is solely dedicated to preserving the culture's heritage and, by extension, the musical fundamentals that it was built upon: deep groove samples, dope breakbeats, and simplistic, on-the-corner emceeing. With O.S.T., their third album, People Under the Stairs have made a musical tribute to these basics. And while it may not break any ground or shift any paradigms, the album is a testament to the enduring strength of straight-up, no-frills hip-hop. Thes One is so dedicated to vinyl that even his bathroom is decorated with classic soul and jazz albums. His nostalgia for the classics is pervasive throughout this record, and you can smell the 80s scent of linoleum, blunts and vinyl as he brings the rare grooves on song after song. And not only do Thes and Double K, the other member of People Under the Stairs, dig deeper than almost anyone else, they also have a great sense of how to reconstruct their samples to illicit some soul-piercing sounds. On ""Empty Bottles of Water"", they place a relaxed, rippling key line over an upbeat drum track as Thes One raps, ""I travel to the beach where each and every wave sounds like ultimate breaks and beats."" On ""Acid Raindrops"", Thes One appropriates a sample from David Walker's cover of ""Lay Lady Lay"" while guest MC Camel raps about a day-in-the-life of a So-Cal b-boy. Although People Under the Stairs flirt with soul, reggae and jazz, the key here is the funk. ""The Hang Loose"" is an old school, roller-rink jam with a funky disco bassline. Thes and Double affect an old school, Sugar Hill Gang flow and namedrop Dr. J, Kool and the Gang, and ""What's Happening""'s Rerun. On ""Tales of Kidd Drunkadelic"", a loungy keyboard bounces on top of a classic boom-bap drum track as a flute blows beneath the sample. With the seamless ease that Thes and Double K weave their samples together, their life-long obsession with their music is apparent and infectious. Unfortunately, lyrics aren't the duo's strong suit. The lyrics generally revolve around their obsession with hip-hop culture, their love of alcohol/herb, and the (often uninteresting) minutia of their daily lives. But given the celebratory funk that the music conjures, the relatively light and redundant subject matter isn't much of a liability. After all, this isn't music for wannabe Lyotards twiddling their thumbs and worrying about some linguistic apocalypse; this is music for playing dominos and sipping on 40s. This is for those lazy days wasted on blunts and lounging by the pool. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6226-ost/,OM,2002.0,"If you're in the mood for some old-school Jazz and a little bit of Rap, People Under the Stairs' album O.S.T. is definitely worth checking out. The band brings together a seamless blend of these two genres and creates a unique sound that is hard to resist. With a rating of 7.7 out of 10, it's clear that this album is one that has captured the attention of many.

Before we dive into the specifics of the album itself, let's take a moment to appreciate the history of People Under the Stairs. Formed in 1997 in Los Angeles, the duo is made up of Thes One and Double K. With a solid following in the underground music scene, they're known for their clever rhymes and expert sampling skills.

When it comes to the creation story of O.S.T., the band dug deep into their record collection for inspiration. Sampling from Jazz and Funk records from the 60s and 70s, People Under the Stairs brings a retro vibe to the album that feels nostalgic but also incredibly fresh. Each beat is meticulously crafted, with layered sounds that keep the listener engaged.

But what really sets O.S.T. apart is the way the band incorporates their love of Jazz into their lyrics. The way Thes One and Double K use their words to flow with the music is impressive. Their rhymes are cleverly crafted, with metaphors and wordplay that show a deep understanding of language. Even if you're not a fan of Rap music, it's impossible not to appreciate the way they bring this art form to life.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Montego Slay,"" which features a catchy melody and a solid bassline. It's a classic example of the band's ability to blend Jazz and Rap seamlessly. Another track worth mentioning is ""San Francisco Knights,"" which showcases the band's storytelling abilities. The lyrics tell a vivid story of the duo's experiences in San Francisco, complete with references to the city's landmarks and culture.

Overall, if you're a fan of either Jazz or Rap, or just appreciate good music in general, People Under the Stairs' album O.S.T. is definitely worth a listen. Their ability to seamlessly blend genres and cleverly craft lyrics is something that shouldn't be missed.

Plone,For Beginner Piano,Electronic,5.4,September 28 1999,Ryan Schreiber,Founder,"According to an inside source (read: Plone's press release), Plone formed in Birmingham, England. They immediately went to work ""creating sounds and ideas for songs."" Then the guy who runs the independent label Wurlitzer Jukebox put out their debut 7"". After their first single was released, they finally started to go out and buy equipment. Take a guess as to what kind of gear they bought-- that's right! ""Old drum machines, analogue keyboards and effects."" So far, these guys sound pretty inspired. Plone's goal, apparently, is to create instrumental electronic pop music. Hence, their concept: ""timeless electronic melodies."" They really are timeless, too, if you take that to mean you'll spend little or no time listening to them. I guess For Beginner Piano sounds nice enough, though. You've got your lilting, somber retro-future music (""Summer Plays Out""), your haunted forest music (""Press a Key""), and the incidental music for a lost level from ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2"" (""Marbles""). Sadly, Boards of Canada already beat Plone at their own game with the release of 1998's Music Has the Right to Children. On For Beginner Piano, the Plone guys just barely step over that line from being serious electronic experimentalists like the majority of their labelmates, to writing nicely-executed but predictable Sega Genesis music. No, it's not so bad if you can stay awake, but it's terribly bland. In fact, it's the new elevator music. Just wait and see if by 2010 doctor's offices aren't comforting their unhealthy visitors by playing this kind of low-volume ambient pop music over the lobby P.A. And if nothing else, I can at least guarantee one of these tracks will show up in a luxury car ad before the year's out. Like so many songs being sold to hip marketing campaigns these days, you can listen to any of For Beginner Piano's ten tracks for hours without ever noticing they're there. (I had headphones on, too.) If these guys could just pick up the pace for a moment, or put some neat effect in there, or even just change the bpms-- anything to keep me interested-- this would be a whole different record. Unfortunately, fate's chosen a different path for Plone-- one of everlasting obscurity and used bin damnation.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6348-for-beginner-piano/,"Matador,Warp,Matador,Warp",,"Are you ready for a synth-heavy journey through time? Look no further than Plone's latest album, ""For Beginner Piano"". This electronic masterpiece takes the listener on a nostalgic trip through 90s electronic music, with a fresh and modern twist.

Plone, hailing from Birmingham, UK, originally formed in the late 90s and quickly became pioneers in electronic music. They broke onto the scene with their playful, synthy sound, using vintage equipment like old Casio keyboards and retro drum machines. They took a hiatus in the mid-2000s before coming back together to create ""For Beginner Piano"", their first album in 20 years.

The album's creation story is as unique as its sound. The band members, remembering the music of their youth, reconnected with the same vintage synths and equipment that they had used early in their career. They set up a studio in a community space in Birmingham and worked for over a year to create the music that would eventually become ""For Beginner Piano"". The album title, a nod to their early days of playing with beginner equipment, reflects the heart of the album--a celebration of their beginnings and a reimagining of their signature sound.

As a long-time fan of Plone, I was ecstatic to hear that they were releasing new music. Listening to ""For Beginner Piano"" was like coming home--nostalgic without feeling outdated. The album's opening track, ""Years and Elements"", sets the tone with its upbeat synths and playful melodies. ""Sunvale Run"" is a standout track, with its dynamic rhythms and layers of synths creating a sound that's both complex and dance-inducing.

While I highly enjoyed this album, it might not be for everyone. The sound is distinct, with a very specific aesthetic and an almost childlike playfulness. The synths can feel a bit too repetitive at times, leading to a sense of predictability throughout the album. That being said, Plone's unique sound and creative energy are impossible to deny.

Overall, ""For Beginner Piano"" is a solid addition to Plone's discography, capturing the sound and spirit of their early work while still feeling fresh and new. It may not quite reach the heights of their earlier albums, but it's still an enjoyable and entertaining listen. Fans of 90s electronic music and inventive synth-pop should give this album a listen.","1. Review A is more critical and negative in tone, while Review B is more positive and enthusiastic.

Tierra Whack,Whack World,Rap,8.3,June 12 2018,Briana Younger,Contributor,"Tierra Whack raps “best believe I’m gon’ sell if I just be myself” less than 30 seconds into her debut audiovisual album, Whack World. But it is nearly impossible to prepare for exactly what she looks and sounds like. Hers is a playful world of surreal scenes and mercurial soundscapes—slow jams while grooming a toy poodle, doo-wop while cleaning up a house party, trap music while lying in a bedazzled coffin. It’s Deep South country and cosmic raps, self-love and middle fingers to naysayers. And you have just 15 minutes to digest it all. Reared in Philadelphia’s famed cypher tradition, the 22-year-old Whack built a reputation on quick-witted freestyles. She was once known as Dizzle Dizz and her lyrical proficiencies earned praise from Meek Mill and A$AP Rocky. But as she moved beyond straight-ahead rapping across the last few years, her music took on more experimental qualities, toying with various types of vocal processing and psychedelic melodies, to riveting effect. She revealed herself as one who doesn’t take herself too seriously, who warps the boundary between simply making art and letting yourself become it. Like OutKast, Missy Elliott, or Busta Rhymes before her, she forces us to reimagine our realities by plopping us into outré versions of theirs. Whack World is a funhouse of minute-long vignettes, teetering between a fantastic dream and an unsettling nightmare. Lyrics share double meanings with the corresponding 15-minute visual Whack released alongside the album, which adds even more dimension and intrigue to the ambitious project; light and dark are forced to coexist. At one point, she snips the strings off of red helium balloons while singing in a comically excessive twang to a potential suitor: “You remind me of my deadbeat dad.” In another bubblegum-backdropped scene, she reveals a half-swollen face and declares: “Probably would’ve blew overnight if I was white.” She’s probably not wrong. This isn’t Whack’s first foray into the absurd. Last year’s “MUMBO JUMBO” video found her in the midst of a horrifying dentist appointment that could double as a deleted scene from Get Out. On that song, she delivers novocaine-induced, mush-mouthed lyrics over a trap beat that forces you to question whether it even matters what she’s saying. Her point, in part, was that mumbling doesn’t always connote the absence of skill but, on the contrary, can be a valid mode of creative expression. It’s a shrewd suggestion and one that lands well, considering her own lyrical nimbleness, and the way she need not rely on it to make compelling music. Little arguments and stories like this land all over Whack World. Despite the brevity of the songs (every single one is exactly a minute long), there are no half-baked ideas here; huge revelations are nestled in the frivolous. “4 Wings” masks the sting of death in a carryout order, while “Pet Cemetery” smudges the line between mourning your dog and mourning your dawg. “My dog had a name/Keepin’ his name alive,” she sings over a disarmingly jovial staccato piano, complete with barking puppies in the background and a video that’s just as literal. Elsewhere, on a lighter note, she encourages self-care—eating fruits and veggies, and drinking water—on “Fruit Salad,” while affirming that she cannot be defined nor denied. Whack World puts forth a portrait of the good and the bad, the weird and the unremarkable, while plowing through insecurities. She uses vanity mirrors to magnify her features on a song titled “Pretty Ugly” and bursts out of a house several sizes too small on “Dr. Seuss,” as if to reflect that feeling of having outgrown your surroundings or other people’s expectations. With the walls closing in, she throws down a bit of wordplay in a helium-infused voice—“Look but don’t touch/I should just be celibate/You the type to sell out/Me? I’m trying to sell a bit”—before pitching into a warped slo-mo like she’s being smothered. The triumph of Whack World feels that much more important given the music industry’s stubborn refusal to champion diverse portrayals of women in rap outside of hypersexualized stereotypes. There is freedom in the margins, and Whack has crafted a work that beautifully manifests her own vision on her own terms. The result is brilliant—from the length of the songs down to the exaggerated imagery. Though she springs from a rich stylistic lineage, her 60-second confections have few modern precedents. Short songs, while in vogue, serve a different purpose here: Where others stretch small ideas and repetition, thinning them out for easy absorption, Whack uses the time constraint to make her big ideas seem larger than the space they’re allotted. Like an evolution in real time, she gives just enough to complete the thought before she morphs and catapults you to the next one. Whack World morphs into a clever exercise in economy and using only what you need. It’s a visual album prepackaged for optimum social media consumption; every tiny piece stands on its own without losing sight of the larger picture. At its core, though, Whack’s sense of humor—her captivating depiction of a black woman’s imagination—is an opportunity to celebrate an aspect of art that often goes uncelebrated, an opportunity for Whack to celebrate herself.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tierra-whack-whack-world/,Self-released,2018.0,"Tierra Whack's 'Whack World' is a game changer in the rap industry. With its unique style and creative approach, Whack delivers 15 tracks in 15 minutes. The album is the perfect embodiment of rap's evolution in the 21st century.

Whack's emergence onto the scene is a testament to her talent and hard work. The rapper, singer, and songwriter started her career under the name Dizzle Dizz in Philadelphia. She found her footing with the mixtape 'Tierra Whack' and hit the headlines with her song 'Mumbo Jumbo.' Soon after, she signed with Interscope Records, and 'Whack World' was born.

The album's creation is a source of fascination because it is not your traditional studio process. Instead of recording tracks in sequence, Whack approached it as if she were making a visual album, similar to Beyonce's 'Lemonade.' She worked with producer Kenete Simms, and graphic designer Walu Mwalilino, to create a visual masterpiece that perfectly accompanies the album's unique sound.

The 15 tracks on 'Whack World' are a tour de force of creative energy. The short length of each song makes it easy to binge-listen. The album opens with 'Black Nails,' a song that immediately hooks listeners with its catchy beat and Whack's memorable lyrics. The following track, 'Bugs Life,' also stands out for its unique melody and relatable lyrics.

One of the standout tracks on the album is 'Fruit Salad.' The song is a powerful tribute to the beauty of diversity, an anthem encouraging listeners to embrace their differences. 'Pet Cemetery' is another highlight of the album, with its haunting beat and chilling lyrics that give listeners goosebumps.

Whack's talent shines on every track, and her versatility is on full display. She effortlessly shifts between rapping and singing, showcasing her range as an artist. The album's production is equally impressive, with Kenete Simms delivering a fresh and unique sound that adds to the album's appeal.

Personally, I find 'Whack World' to be one of the most groundbreaking rap albums of the decade. Whack's approach to creating this album is a testament to her artistic vision and creative genius. The lyrics and beats are incredibly catchy, and the short length of the songs makes it easy to listen to the whole thing in one sitting.

Overall, I give 'Whack World' a solid 8.3 out of 10. The album is a modern masterpiece that is sure to leave a lasting impact on the rap industry.

Electric Six,Switzerland,"Electronic,Rock",4.9,November 10 2006,Adam Moerder,,"I'm not sure when and if the Electric Six will recover from debut album Fire's resulting hangover, but Switzerland suggests the sun's setting on the band's party-hardy days. Even frontman Dick Valentine has acknowledged this, noting how the ""dance"" trope has been dropped from all lyrics on the new album. That said, no one's checking into Betty Ford just yet; in fact, Switzerland's crammed with more sex, drugs, and cocoa puffs (or at least cocoa papacies) than ever before. Problem is, who cares what Valentine's croaking about if the arena rock's as flaccid as on SeÃ±or Smoke? Fans of Fire like to argue that E6's tragic flaw on recent releases has been a loss of edge, an abandonment of visceral surf/punk/disco/metal for a tamer, more AOR-centric sound. The easy solution? Turn the amps to 11 and kick more ass. The harsh reality? The more=better strategy can flop in practice, no matter how enticing hyperbolizing your art appears-- it's why so many ""Family Guy"" jokes tank or why no one listens to Michael Moore. To give credit where it's due, single ""I Buy the Drugs"" and ""Infected Girls"", two of Switzerland's brighter spots, hustle substance abuse and unsafe sex without being famished for attention. While the latter twitches over subtle electro-rock, ""Drugs"" rallies around a proud titular chorus, the hearty power chords almost waxing sentimental. Hell, ""Drugs"" and ""Germans In Mexico"" would even pass as Hold Steady B-sides if Valentine could shut his yap. Unfortunately, the frontman's crazed growl dashes any nuanced developments the band has reached in their songwriting, maintaining a grating tone consistently throughout, save maybe for the unexpected falsetto on ""Pulling the Plug on the Party"". Scapegoating Valentine may seem too easy, but considering this album's concurrent release with similar artist Andrew W.K.'s newest and most novel offering, the guy's really lagging behind the pomp-rock curve. While heeding to a stricter glam doctrine, Switzerland mostly reveals the band's arrested development, even to the point of rendering their absurdist, irreverent humor irrelevant. After all, trying to delineate the band's level of irony would be like taking the stairs in an Escher painting--it's an unnecessary mindfuck. The basic dilemma remains that, stripped of their shtick and ""Danger! High Voltage"" laurels to be taken at face value, the band seems content dicking around with sound effects and varied genres rather than eliciting any sort of innate rawk reaction, and the sex, drugs, etc. bit stinks of telling, not showing.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9588-switzerland/,Metropolis,2006.0,"When it comes to Electric Six's ""Switzerland"" album, I must say that I am left with mixed feelings. As an avid listener of their electronic-rock sound, I was excited to dive into their latest release. However, after giving the album several listens, I'm not sure I can recommend it wholeheartedly.

But before we get into my personal opinions, let's talk about the band's history and the creation of this album. Electric Six has been around since the early 2000s, known for their funky, often humorous, and always unique approach to music. ""Switzerland"" is their twelfth studio album, released in 2019.

In interviews prior to the album's release, the band spoke of their desire to push the envelope even further with this record, incorporating more experimental elements alongside their signature sound. I must say, they definitely delivered on the experimentation front. ""Switzerland"" is an eclectic mix of electronic, rock, and even some country-inspired sounds.

However, while the experimentation is certainly admirable, I can't help but feel that Electric Six has gone a bit too far off the beaten path. Tracks like ""Daddy's Boy"" and ""Suedehead"" come off as jarring and disjointed, lacking the cohesion and catchiness of some of the band's previous hits.

That's not to say that the album is all bad. There are standout tracks like ""The Neighbourhood Would Understand"" and ""Worm In The Wood,"" which capture the band's irreverent spirit and showcase lead singer Dick Valentine's distinctive vocals.

Overall, I would give ""Switzerland"" a 4.9 out of 10, which is hard for me to admit as a fan of the band. While I appreciate Electric Six's desire to push the boundaries of their sound, this album falls short in terms of cohesive songwriting and memorable hooks. However, for fans of experimental electronic-rock and those willing to venture outside their musical comfort zone, ""Switzerland"" may be worth a listen.","1.

Lil Wayne,Tha Carter III,Rap,8.7,June 12 2008,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"""Where the fuck is my guitar?"" Lil Wayne is a terrible guitarist. Just incredibly bad. The fact was evident at this year's Summer Jam, when he spent two and a half interminable minutes noodling and crooning all by his lonesome while a stadium full of New York's most devout hip-hop fans looked on bewildered. ""Is he really playing the guitar right now?"" giggled a teenage girl. ""That's not a chord or anything!"" Still, she recorded Wayne in all his tatted-up Tracy Chapman glory for YouTube posterity just the same. While everyone else on the day's bill-- from Alicia Keys to Kanye West-- filled their shortened, festival-style sets with hits and finely-tailored theatrics, the audience's most anticipated act took the opportunity get his Guitar for Dummies on; Lil Wayne is, as he likes to say, ""different."" Always has been. Earmarked as a gifted elementary school student in New Orleans, he became the token prodigy of his hometown's Cash Money clique at the age of 16, spitting pipsqueak gangsterisms over skittering Mannie Fresh beats. And, opposed to the typical rap flame-out trajectory, Wayne got better-- and stranger-- with each album. Now, nine years after his first solo LP, and on the heels of an unprecedented glut of increasingly remarkable mixtape and internet leaks, we get Tha Carter III, the epic culmination of a lifetime of eccentricities. This is Wayne's moment and he embraces it on his own terms. Instead of hiding his bootleg-bred quirks in anticipation of the big-budget spotlight, he distills the myriad metaphors, convulsing flows, and vein-splitting emotions into a commercially gratifying package that's as weird as it wants to be; he eventually finds his guitar but keeps the strumming in check. ""I pay my dues, you keep the difference."" As the major music industry continues to wheeze and splinter, Lil Wayne's spitball marketing plan for C3 is an unprecedented masterstroke. Over the past couple of years, he's given away more worthwhile free music online than most artists of his stature ever release officially. Using the mixtape market as a free-for-all training ground, Wayne expanded his persona, voice, and talent while presumptively killing off thousands of wannabe MCs hoping to charge five bucks for some garbage CD-R. For that alone, he deserves thanks. Wayne set the definition for a Web 2.0 MC-- his output pours through computer speakers at broadband speeds. And while stellar tapes like Dedication 2 and Da Drought 3 offered-up plenty of hidden darts for sun-deprived message board nerds, his Just Say Yes policy toward any and all guest invitations (Enrique Iglesias? Why not!) provided maximum visibility and chiseled his radio-friendly chops. Piggybacking on hits by Chris Brown and Lloyd undoubtedly did wonders for his giggling teenage girl fan base, but a lesser-known assist appears to have had an even bigger effect on the new record. ""Gotta work everyday/ Gotta not be clichÃ©/ Gotta stand out like Andre 3K."" One of the few satisfying tracks on OutKast's bungled Idlewild album was a woozy bitchfest called ""Hollywood Divorce"" featuring Lil Wayne. In hindsight, the invite feels like an act of sanctification. The song's a lesson in winning idiosyncrasies-- Andre, Big Boi, and Wayne are all salty, but they make sure to side-step pessimism (Big Boi deems rumor mongers ""M&M's with no nuts""). Traces of the South's most genre-bursting, P-Funk-worshipping ATLiens can be heard all over C3, from Wayne's staccato phrasing on ""Mr. Carter"" to the extraterrestrial fetishism of ""Phone Home"" to the eclectic unpredictability of it all. The musical open-mindedness also lifts C3 above regional niches-- the #1 hit ""Lollipop"" sounds more like it was born on Jupiter than anywhere on earth. While Wayne isn't quite ready to produce something like ""Hey Ya!"", don't be shocked if you see him held up by a pair of leprechaun suspenders in the not-so-distant future. ""I've done it before, please don't make me do it no more."" C3 is Wayne's most absurd album to date but it's also his most personal. ""Shoot Me Down"", with its ""Lose Yourself""-style guitar chug and ominous hook, has the rapper looking all the way back to age 12, when he accidentally shot himself with a .44 Magnum while toying with the gun in a mirror. ""Two more inches I'd have been in that casket/ According to the doctor I could've died in traffic,"" he rhymes on ""3 Peat"", possibly referring to the day in 2001 when a disgruntled groupie shot at his tour bus, planting a bullet in his chest. Such details add even more gravitas to his grizzled, elastic timbre, which suggests an impossibly hoarse (and high) David Ruffin at times. ""All I ask is don't take our love for granted,"" sings a perfectly sympathetic Babyface alongside Wayne on the lush ballad ""Comfortable"", the line coming off more like a saucer-eyed plea than a threat. And the LP's best track doubles as its most crazed and pained. ""Playing With Fire"" is a full-on faux-metal stunner that hearkens back to Bad Boy's cinematic peak. On it, Wayne reaches Ghostface levels of paranoid distress: ""I'm doin' the same shit Martin Luther King did/ Checkin' in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch/ Same balcony like assassinate me, bitch!"" His claims of MLK grandeur are far-fetched, but his impassioned delivery makes them seem more believable than one would think possible. Apparently, those Biggie and Pac references are getting to his codeine-addled brain-- after all, at 25, Wayne is now older than both legends were when they were gunned down. The implicit danger of carrying on such a legacy only adds to the rapper's dramatic reading, and his anguish burns as hot as his punchlines. ""I think everybody gonna like this one...I got one!"" Considering his running-faucet leak rate, there are bound to be fanboy quibbles about the intricacies of C3's tracklist (e.g., the buoyant web gem ""La La La"" should replace ""La La"" and its braindead Busta Rhymes verse, and what about the hazy ""I Feel Like Dying"" or the promising speed-soul track ""3 a.m.""?). But considering there are probably several hard drives stuffed with syrupy odes featuring Wayne's dubious auto-tuned howl, the final tally is exquisitely balanced and considered. After dozens of listens, the record's overflowing minutiae-- from Fabulous and Juelz Santana's overachieving cameos to Wayne's hilariously apropos kinship with ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage-- still feels limitless. Just as the record's cover playfully skews the Ready to Die/Illmatic baby-picture formula with Photoshopped tattoos, Wayne updates what it means to be the best rapper alive here. Gangster dandy. Fender-slinging sex god. Intergalactic prankster. It's all in him.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11608-tha-carter-iii/,Cash Money,2008.0,"When Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III dropped in 2008, it was clear that the game was about to be changed. As a fan of hip-hop, it was impossible to avoid the buzz surrounding the album, with its heavy promotion and high anticipation. As a longtime fan of Lil Wayne, I was particularly excited to see what my favorite rapper had in store this time around. Suffice to say, Tha Carter III left me impressed and happy, with its eclectic mix of hard-hitting beats, introspective bars, and unexpected features.

For those who aren't familiar with Lil Wayne's rise to fame, it's worth mentioning that this was his sixth studio album, coming after a long string of successful mixtapes and collaborations. Over the years, Lil Wayne had established himself as one of the most versatile and creative rappers in the game, known for his intricate wordplay, unconventional flow, and vivid storytelling. Tha Carter III was his chance to prove that he was not just a flash in the pan, but a true rap icon.

The creation story of Tha Carter III is an interesting one. As Lil Wayne himself has revealed in interviews, he recorded over 80 songs for the album, before finally settling on the 16 tracks that made the final cut. This level of productivity and creativity is impressive, to say the least. In fact, Lil Wayne was so prolific during this period that he even released a separate mixtape, entitled The Drought Is Over 6: The Reincarnation, which contained outtakes from Tha Carter III.

But enough about the backstory. Let's get into the meat of the album. Tha Carter III opens with the bombastic ""3 Peat"", a track that sets the tone for what's to come. The beat is hard-hitting, with a thumping bassline and a jagged synth melody. Lil Wayne's flow is impeccable, as he switches up his cadence and drops clever punchlines left and right. It's a great intro track, and it's followed by other bangers such as ""Mr. Carter"", ""A Milli"", and ""Got Money"".

However, what sets Tha Carter III apart from other rap albums of its time is Lil Wayne's willingness to experiment and push boundaries. Case in point: ""Dr. Carter"", a song in which he adopts the persona of a doctor rapping about the state of the hip-hop industry. It's a creative and humorous concept, and it works surprisingly well. Similarly, ""Playing With Fire"" is a haunting ballad that showcases Lil Wayne's vulnerable side, as he reflects on his addiction to drugs and fame.

Of course, Tha Carter III wouldn't be the classic that it is without its standout tracks. ""Lollipop"", which features a hook sung by R&B star Static Major, was a massive hit when it dropped, and it's still a guilty pleasure of mine to this day. The beat is catchy and infectious, and Lil Wayne's verses are playful and seductive. Meanwhile, ""Comfortable"", featuring R&B singer Babyface, is a smooth and sultry track that showcases Lil Wayne's romantic side.

Overall, I would give Tha Carter III a solid 8.7 out of 10. It's not a perfect album, of course (what is?), but it's a work of art that showcases Lil Wayne's range and talent as a rapper. From the hard-hitting bangers to the introspective ballads, from the playful hooks to the creative concepts, Tha Carter III is a must-listen for any fan of hip-hop.","Step 1: Review A uses informal language and includes profanity, while Review B uses more formal language and is devoid of profanity.

Oxford Collapse,Bits,Rock,7.8,August 5 2008,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Bits begins with an engine turning over, a car peeling off, and, a moment later, Brooklyn three-piece Oxford Collapse barreling along like an excited pup chasing after it. Throughout that hectic rush, opener ""Electric Arc"" finds its grounding in one of its few lyrics-- ""I can remember things/ I just don't know what to do."" Guitarist/vocalist Michael Pace could just as easily be saying ""I can't remember things,"" and either way would work, as the two main ingredients in Oxford Collapse's songwriting are reminiscence and getting fucked up (see the title of their last record, Remember the Night Parties). But as much as Bits continues their exploration of post-collegiate drinking songs, they don't romanticize either aspect in the manner that Vampire Weekend or the Hold Steady do. Think more of the twentysomething working for the weekend, but giving up by Wednesday, enjoying post-work happy hours to the point where Thursday's sure to be a hassle. Or as the stein-hoisting hook of ""Young Love Delivers"" goes, ""We're doing fine/ For our steady, slow decline."" If this stasis has been explored thoroughly throughout the band's career, the concept of growing up has been less so, perhaps necessarily. The greatest pleasures on Remember the Night Parties were borne of amateurism-- think the the hilariously flubbed drum fill on ""Please Visit Your National Parks"" and ""Lady Lawyers""'s complete ignorance of pitch-- while the pokey moments resulted from an experimentalism that felt a bit too forced (the middle of ""Loser City"", ""Return of the Burno""). Nothing here hits with the immediacy of ""National Parks"", but consider it a blessing in disguise-- that song towered over its surroundings, whereas Bits is the sort of record where your favorite song could change weekly. For the first time, the band's neither over nor underproduced, and it results in a marked improvement that doesn't owe itself to a sea change of songwriting or sound. I wish there was a more exciting way to describe it than ""they're just better,"" but those who liked Remember the Night Parties and left wanting that vague sense of ""more"" are rewarded. Yes, this is hardworking indie with Sub Pop values, steeped in a continuum of 1980s college rock acts and 90s bands influenced by 80s college rock. Bits is streaked with irreverence, whether for C&W formality (the intuitively simple melodies of ""Featherbeds"" and ""Young Love Delivers""), instrumental tightness (at times, they can make No Age sound like the Famous Flames) or lyrical artifice. Most likely students of Advanced Malkmus, the most resonant moments still feel in-jokey: ""My love came back from Sweden/ Brought me some bathroom reading,"" ""He got jacked up playing leapfrog/ And he was never quite the same."" Even the record's most obvious sonic curveball (""A Wedding"") is only that because it's based off the sawdust cellos that punctuated the more shadowy moments of There's Nothing Wrong With Love. As is, the string lines mirror Pace's subtly trance-like guitar parts, weaving in high-register licks while an open G or D drones beneath it. Or, more thumbnail-style, perhaps a response to what doubters asked about Nouns-- what if you got rid of the static and the talking points? Lead single ""The Birthday Wars"" broils in distortion, initially feeling like it's following the mini-trend of having Dave Fridmann red-level your important follow-up. But it's not a slam-dunk hook that sells the song; it's the way Pace keens ""whoa"" at the end of each line. That's evidence of how the band has become wiser about apportioning big moments rather than simply dumping them on you. Similarly, ""Vernon-Jackson"" and ""I Hate Nobody"" both sound strangely plateau'ed-- the band gets incrementally louder throughout, suggesting a massive payoff that Oxford Collapse might have awkwardly delivered on in the past. Unfortunately, listeners too often get caught up in using a lack of coolness as a backhanded compliment, and even if there is a return to a DIY aesthetic with OC (along with Times New Viking, Wye Oak, No Age), it's still disarming. Oxford Collapse tend to be big on dedications and inclusiveness-- see the lovey hook on ""For the Winter Coats"".Â  I hope it doesn't sell Bits short likening it to indie comfort food, but as ""I Hate Nobody"" and the pocket-Arcade Fire shoutalong ""Children's Crusade"" mash fist pumps and group hugs into the same motion, it hardly matters that Oxford Collapse seem more content soundtracking your favorite moments than becoming your favorite band.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12063-bits/,Sub Pop,2008.0,"Hey music lovers, today we're going to be talking about Oxford Collapse's album ""Bits,"" a rock album that has been getting some buzz recently. This band has been around for a while, and their experience and talent are readily apparent in the music they create. 

Oxford Collapse's history dates back to 2001, when they formed in Brooklyn, New York. Consisting of members Mike Pace, Dan Fetherston, and Adam Rizer, the band has released several albums over the years, including their 2004 debut ""Some Wilderness,"" and 2006's ""Remember the Night Parties."" 

""Bits"" is the band's fourth studio album, and it was released in 2008. The album was recorded in Austin, Texas, a change of scenery that seems to have had a noticeable impact on the band's sound. Producer Mike McCarthy helped to capture the raw energy and intensity of the band's live performances, resulting in a collection of songs that are both polished and edgy at the same time. 

From the opening track ""Electric Arc,"" this album grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Each song is expertly crafted, with intricate guitar riffs and driving percussion that keep the energy level high from start to finish. ""The Birthday Wars"" is a standout track, with its catchy chorus and clever lyrics that are sure to get stuck in your head. 

One thing I appreciate about this album is that it doesn't rely on gimmicks or flashy production techniques. Instead, it's a straightforward rock album that's focused on delivering great music. Each song is unique and stands out on its own, but together they form a cohesive whole that showcases the band's talent and creativity. 

Overall, I'd give ""Bits"" by Oxford Collapse a rating of 7.8 out of 10. While there are a few moments that don't quite hit the mark, the album as a whole is well worth a listen for any rock fan. It's clear that this band has a deep love and respect for the genre, and they've crafted an album that both pays homage to its roots while also pushing it forward into new territory.

Guitar,Tokyo,Rock,5.2,March 27 2006,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"In theory, I love to hear traditional instruments and all their embedded associations mixing with the open-ended signifiers of electronic music. The guitar, so bound to Western popular music since the middle of the 20th century, seems particularly receptive to careful dissection by microprocessor. Many personal favorites from the past five years have come from someone trying to figure out novel ways to process an instrument and render the familiar new. As you might guess from the name German musician Michael Lückner gives to his project, he's a fan of the six-string. His first record with the name was 2001's Sunkissed, released, appropriately enough, on Morr. The album was a clear tribute to My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, the guiding force for Lückner's experiments in sound manipulation. Following this well-received record, Lückner spent a good deal of time in Japan, and his 2004 Honeysky never made it out of that country. The inspiration for his third record comes from instruments he encountered there, particularly the guitar-like koto and pipa. They are indeed lovely-sounding instruments, and Lückner ably integrates their timbre into his sound. Problem is, there's not much going on beyond laying loops of various plucked phrases atop dully repetitive mid-tempo drum programming. Tracks throughout feel stiff and ridged; you can almost see the constituent parts of each being dragged and dropped into place and snapped into the grid. Very little processing is happening on ""Naoki"" and ""Red and White"", and the tunes are nice enough, but the lack of development and table-flat dynamic range makes for pleasant background music and nothing more. Vocalist and regular Lückner collaborator Ayako Akashiba joins on ""Tokyo Memory"" and contributes to most of the remaining tracks. Her style is prototypically Japanese indie, with its high, breathy coos, and it also sounds remarkably like one of the sisters in Múm. Two of the tracks with Akashiba hearken back to Guitar's shoegaze sound, with Lückner running his instruments through a chain of pedals (or some digital equivalent), and these are by far the most interesting. They work because they sound less careful and inhibited, without the fussy concern for every plucked string to be in its precise place. ""Sakura Coming"", with its throbbing sheets of sound underneath Akashiba's voice, sounds so much sloppier and less mannered than anything that comes before, with a weird mix and timings that don't quite line up. It's a flash of messy life on a record that too often feels half asleep.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3604-tokyo/,Onitor,2006.0,"When it comes to rock music, we rarely encounter bands who deviate from the norm and bring something truly fresh to the table. But with Guitar's album ""Tokyo,"" we have a band who not only steers away from the predictable but manages to create an eclectic sound that's fascinating and hypnotic. While the album's rating of 5.2 out of 10 doesn't necessarily do its brilliance justice, it certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea. But for those who dare to take a bite, it's a treat for the ears.

To fully grasp the album's uniqueness, it's important to know Guitar's history. Hailing from a small town in California, the band is a four-piece that has been making music together for over a decade. Known for their experimental approach to rock, the group's sound has evolved tremendously over the years, and ""Tokyo"" sees them continuing to push the boundaries of the genre.

The album's creation story is equally intriguing. Guitar took a break from the music industry for four years before releasing ""Tokyo."" They spent most of that time traveling to different parts of the world to get inspiration for the album. According to the band's lead singer, the idea behind ""Tokyo"" was to make an album that captured the essence of the city's energy and vibe.

The result is a sound that's both chaotic and soothing. The album's opener, ""Lost in the City,"" sets the tone for what's to come. It's a sonic onslaught of instrumentation that makes it challenging to understand where one sound ends and the next begins. And yet, the chaos is grounded by the song's catchy melody, making it an accessible entry point for new listeners.

As the album progresses, we're taken on a musical journey that's epic in scope. ""Rainy Nights"" is a melancholic ballad that showcases the band's ability to tug at our heartstrings, while ""Neon Lights"" is a foot-stomping, head-banging anthem that captures the electric energy of Tokyo's nightlife scene.

Personally, I loved the album's diversity. Each song takes us to a different place and time, and it's impossible to get bored. ""Nostalgic Blues"" is a stand-out track for me because of its bluesy guitar riffs and the raw, honest lyrics. But even the album's weakest track, ""Broken Dreams,"" has something to offer. The dreamy instrumentals and ethereal vocals make it a perfect bedtime listening.

In conclusion, Guitar's ""Tokyo"" is a triumph of experimental rock. It's an album that demands attention and doesn't cater to mainstream expectations, but for those who give it a chance, it's a rewarding experience. The band's fearless approach to music-making has resulted in an album that captures the essence of one of the most vibrant cities on the planet.

Michael Mayer,Fabric 13,Electronic,8.5,November 13 2003,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"My wishlist of albums from artists who have yet to record full-lengths is as follows: Superpitcher, Junior Boys, Vitalic and, most of all, Michael Mayer. Whenever a new Mayer project is announced, it serves as a reminder of how few of his productions have been released. Yet whenever I hear these projects-- whether they be remixes, another release on his peerless tech-house label, Kompakt, or his ground-shifting mixes-- I'm reminded how thankful I am that he's at least out there doing what he does. The latest work from Mayer is his contribution to one of London club/label Fabric's mix series. Fabric's label division has been spoiling us recently with outstanding contributions from Swayzak (Fabric 11) and Jacques Lu Cont (Fabrclive.9), among others, but this is arguably the strongest release in its history. Incredibly, it also challenges 2000's Immer as the best release in Mayer's catalog, effortlessly drawing from his own Kompakt pool as well as eight other labels, including Playhouse, Plong, and Volt. Like most of Fabric's releases, Mayer's record is made with the dancefloor in mind so it's more ferocious than Immer, but like that dissection of the blissed-out end of German microhouse, it retains a Big Picture overview. In the past, Mayer's mixes have often seemed to be an attempt at taking a definitive snapshot of a particular sound from Neuhouse's mission statement, from the effortlessly blended, almost soothing and silken Immer to the schaffelfieber of Mayer's recent Peel Session (which is available only on mp3, not that we endorse that sort of thing, etc.) to the collection of Kompakt's more banging 12\xA5\xA5 sounds on Speciher. Instead, Fabric 13 is a more eclectic set, blending the differences between the seductive warmth and melody-- and increasingly pop and nu-glam-- sounds of Kompakt and adding underlying tones of menace and melancholy. Connecting the dots between elements of not only his own label but of German tech-house as a whole, Mayer offers a panoramic view of the scene. He even steps overground on a couple of occasions, utilizing both Jackson's Midnight Fuck remix of ""Run into Flowers"" by French nu-shoegazers and Pitchfork faves M83 and a remix of Westban's German hit ""Oldschool, Baby"". With vocals by Nena (of ""99 Luftballoons"" fame), who wields her retro charm as a weapon, ""Oldschool, Baby"" flits between quoting small elements of Italo-piano and acid house and 80s electro, drawing on the charms of the past without ever rooting itself in one place and time. ""We are the moment/ Here to last,"" Nena claims on a track that even outdoes the set's other great pop moments, the pair of mixes of Heiko Voss' contagious ""I Think About You"" that bookend the mix. (Voss' oftentimes partner Thomas Schaeben appears twice, including a collaboration with Geiger and Schad Privat called ""Really Real"", a swoon song whose superfluous title fits its overflowing sound.) Elsewhere, the always thrilling Superpitcher is represented by his Total 5 glam-shuffle track ""Mushroom"", and a newer Mayer favorite, Richard Davis, is tossed into the mix a couple of times-- most memorably on ""Bring Me Closer"", a nightmare filled with haunting skips and jumps, baroque strings that seem to move in multiple directions at once, and an uneasy central pulse. The central pulse on Fabric 13, Villalobos' ""Easy Lee"", is more of a solemn, battered lub. One of the highlights of his Alcachofa album, the Chilean ex-pat's woozy, weak vocodered voice sounds even more ominous and mournful among the near-gothic tones of Mayer's mix. Villalobos' work is a fitting foundation for this record, a mix of surging, sharp dance rhythms which never build to any of the kind of overpowering peaks that could keep home listeners and/or tech-house novices at arm's length. Every so often Mayer will get the odd criticism that he's simply an excellent ringleader and idea man, sort of the Dave Eggers of tech-house. Well, that line of talk is frankly wrong. He expertly scouts and attracts the talent, sequences the tracks, and sets the tone for the entire sound-- despite his own productions remaining sadly few and far between. Michael Mayer's two mixes and his Peel Session mark him as one of the year's most vital artists, a sort of weatherman who determines which way the wind blows in Berlin, Cologne, and any place where ears are cocked.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5551-fabric-13/,Fabric,2003.0,"Allow me to introduce you to an album that will change the way you think about electronic music: Fabric 13 by Michael Mayer.

Mayer, a German DJ and producer, is a pillar of the techno scene. He had already solidified himself as a master of the craft by the time he was tapped to contribute to the prestigious Fabric mix series, but Fabric 13 took things to a whole other level. In this 2003 release, Mayer expertly weaves together an eclectic selection of tracks, showcasing his unique and wide-ranging taste.

The mix kicks off with ""Wondrous Place"" by Billy Fury, immediately setting a nostalgic tone. This is vintage rock and roll, but with a modern electronic twist that sets the stage for what's to come. As the mix progresses, we're treated to everything from the trippy techno of Reinhard Voigt's ""Supertiel"" to the playful, almost whimsical ""Altes Testament"" by Justus Köhncke.

One of my personal favorites on the album is ""Maureen"" by M. Mayer, which features ethereal synths that create a dreamlike atmosphere. It's the kind of track that makes me feel like I'm floating, weightless and carefree.

The story behind the creation of Fabric 13 is almost as captivating as the music itself. Apparently, Mayer put the mix together in just two days, working through the night to create something that was truly special. It's a testament to his talent and his passion for the craft.

Overall, I'd say that Fabric 13 is a fantastic electronic album that deserves all the accolades it's received. Mayer has proven himself to be a master curator and storyteller, weaving together a mix that showcases his eclectic tastes and his unparalleled skill as a DJ. If you're looking for an electronic album that's equal parts nostalgic and forward-thinking, then look no further. Fabric 13 is a true masterpiece of the genre. I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed, providing specific examples of tracks and labels featured in the album.
2. Review A also includes more personal opinions and reflections on Mayer's previous work and his impact on the tech-house scene.

Various Artists,"Boddie Recording Company: Cleveland, Ohio",,7.5,November 23 2011,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"Do a quick Google search for 12202 Union Avenue, Cleveland, OH. The top result is a Google map that still shows a Boddie Recording label at the address. Switch to Street View, and there's an attractive red two-story house with yellow trim and a sign out front that says ""Boddie,"" with eighth notes standing in for the Ds. Down the driveway, a garage is visible, but it's not an ordinary garage. It's the remains of Boddie Recording Company, the long-lived but never well-known recording concern of Thomas and Louise Boddie. The outbuildings behind the house still contain the ephemera of record labels that long ago faded to silence, a studio that hosted its last session decades ago, and a pressing plant that has sat idle since the mid-1980s, some of the components of the pressing line long since sold off. In this space, a few hundred 45s and LPs were prepared for a world that never bothered to hear them. Though this release doesn't strictly fall under the banner of Numero Group's long-running soul archeology project Eccentric Soul, it fits with the spirit of the project, unearthing not just the music made at Boddie but also the history and personalities surrounding it-- the old, grainy photographs and detailed histories contained in the two liner-note booklets place the music on these three CDs in the context of the people that made it and the place where it was made. Boddie Recording Company was born out of Thomas Boddie's passion for electronics, a passion he acquired when very young. He built his own radios and speaker systems in junior high, went to tech school (the only black student in his class), served in the Army Air Force during World War II. He got himself a job repairing organs after his discharge and apprenticed at a local Cleveland studio while amassing a collection of studio gear in the basement of the house he shared with his brother. Boddie's fledgling company cut its first sides in 1959, the same year Berry Gordy founded Motown on the other side of Lake Erie, but the two companies' arcs could not have been more different. Where Gordy assembled a brilliant core of creative people who built long-lasting working relationships and devised processes of production and quality control that turned his company into a powerhouse, Boddie and his wife worked day and night with very limited resources to build a studio behind their new house that wasn't ready for business until 1964. Even then, there was no team. Boddie recorded local acts but had no house band. The company established several imprints on which to release recordings but had no real avenues through which to promote them. The first disc of this set focuses on the Soul Kitchen and related Cookin' labels, which were active primarily in the early 1970s. The music on these releases falls mostly in the psychedelic soul realm-- during the same period, one of Cleveland's most admired bands was the Purple Image, a funky psychedelic outfit that recorded a classic self-titled LP in 1970. The Creations Unlimited and the Inter-Circle each cut strong fuzz funk singles, Ricky Hodges' ""I Feel It (The Love You Have For Me)"" features fantastically ragged guitar taking bites out of an elastic beat while flute flutters around his soul shouting, and ""Soul Feeling"" finds Frankie Pighee & the Soulettes making their own outstanding contribution to the long lineage of soul roll-call tunes. None of it is especially polished, and it's hard to pinpoint the potential hits that never were, because there were so many records like this being made at the time; but there is a certain optimism and spirit of hard work in these recordings that makes them an exciting body of work to listen to all at once. The same can be said of the earlier recordings on disc two, which were mostly released on the Luau label. There are some great band names-- the Atomic Aces and the Modern Detergents definitely top the list-- and a lot of rollicking R&B on the disc, which works with disc one to paint a picture of the evolving soul scene in Cleveland during the era. There was a lot of talent toiling down there in the dead-end clubs, and Boddie captured a good cross-section of it. While these recordings are fun and sometimes even great, they didn't exactly provide the seeds for any money trees, and Thomas Boddie continued to repair organs and radios on the side. He slowly pieced together his own pressing plant, he recorded a lot of out-of-town bluegrass and folk groups touring through Cleveland, he built his own mobile recording unit, he ran a side company called Boddie Audio Advertising (it was a car with a PA on top-- they used it to support Carl Stokes' campaign for mayor), and he also tapped in to one of the safer-- if not more profitable-- markets in music: gospel. The final disc of the set is filled with gospel recordings from Boddie's Bounty imprint, spanning from 1967 all the way to 1983, the very twilight of Boddie as a recording concern. Bits of gospel do crop up on the other discs (the King James Version's two tracks on disc one are especially entertaining), but disc three is a clinic in the numerous ways that singers and bands found to put their faith into music. Some of it is ham-handed and overwrought-- Rev. R.L. Hubbard's operatics on ""Child of the King"" do not complement the spooky soul backing, and the screechy kid vocals of the Wings of Faith Juniors of Grand Rapids, Michigan, are rough sledding-- but a lot of it is clever and enjoyable on its own musical terms. Brother Bill wasn't the only one to wrap religion in a faux-countercultural rap, but he does it with a lot of panache, and Silver King's ""Trouble in the Water"" psychedelicizes a variation on the old ""Wade in the Water"" themes. A couple of songs engage in some rather un-Christian theft. Sound of Soul's ""Gospel Train"" is actually the Impressions' ""People Get Ready"" lazily retitled, and the Gospel Ensemble's ""What You Need"" liberally borrows from the Isley Brothers' ""It's Your Thing"", to name two examples that give soul fans an opportunity to play detective. Some of the later gospel sides were recorded not at Boddie's studio but in the actual churches, using his mobile unit. As his vinyl pressing operation, never big enough to be a hugely profitable concern, struggled in the early 1980s in the face of collapsing demand, Thomas Boddie got into cassette duplication. He'd often make a recording at a service that would then be duplicated and sold to congregants. Boddie never shuttered his company. He died in 2006, but he hadn't ever considered putting Boddie Recording Company to bed permanently. Instead, it faded quietly away, years of incredibly hard work and long hours settling silently under layers of dust in the buildings behind his house. Boddie is a footnote to Cleveland's musical history, more or less, but as the city's premier low-cost studio, he provided a huge service to the city's music scene for over 20 years. This set pulls some of that service into the light and tells a story with the records he left behind.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16050-boddie-recording-company-cleveland-ohio/,Numero Group,2011.0,"Looking for a deep dive into some hidden gems of the Nan genre? Look no further than ""Boddie Recording Company: Cleveland, Ohio"" by Various Artists. This album comes with a solid rating of 7.5 out of 10, and after listening to it, I can see why.

First, let's talk about the history of the Boddie Recording Company. The company's founder, Thomas Boddie, started the business in the early 1950s in Cleveland, Ohio, with the dream of recording some of the best voices in the region. Boddie was a true pioneer, blazing a trail for independent record labels everywhere. He recorded music in a wide range of genres, including gospel, rock, country, and, of course, nan. 

This album brings together some of the best Nan tracks recorded by the Boddie Recording Company, which ran for over 30 years and became a bit of an institution in the Cleveland music scene. It's a fascinating snapshot of a moment in time, and it's a treat to hear these tunes again.

So, what about the music itself? Well, it's certainly quirky and eclectic! Some of the tracks are classic Nan numbers, with jangling guitars and off-kilter vocals. Others are more experimental, with spacey synths and unexpected twists and turns. My personal favorite is ""Wasting My Time,"" a dreamy, melancholy number that showcases the emotive vocals of Joanne Johnson. 

Overall, there's a lot to like about this album. The sound quality is impressive, especially considering the age of some of these recordings. The liner notes are also a real treat, providing insight into the stories behind the songs and the musicians who made them.

Of course, if you're not already a fan of Nan, this album might not be for you. It's certainly an acquired taste, with its unconventional rhythms and melodies. But for those who appreciate the genre or are looking to branch out into something new, ""Boddie Recording Company: Cleveland, Ohio"" is well worth a listen.

In conclusion, ""Boddie Recording Company: Cleveland, Ohio"" is a fascinating collection of Nan tracks from a much-loved indie label. With its unusual sound, it won't be for everyone, but for those who can appreciate the genre in all its glory, this album is sure to hit the spot. Give it a listen!","1.

Luna,Rendezvous,Rock,7.3,October 24 2004,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"As you may have read in these very pages a few days ago, Rendezvous is Luna's final album. After 13 years and seven studio albums, bandleader Dean Wareham decided it was time to cap his second band's run while it was still riding high and avoid a potential acrimonious breakdown, such as the one that felled his legendary first band, Galaxie 500. As it is, Luna's original rhythm section of ex-Chills bassist Justin Harwood and ex-Feelies drummer Stanley Demeski-- which, along with Wareham, had afforded Luna a sort of indie rock supergroup status-- departed in the late 90s, precipitating a gradual shift in the band's music toward the middle of the road. Thankfully, Wareham put the brakes on before they got there, and Rendezvous is a worthy if not exactly earth-moving capstone to the band's career. Luna were never a particularly intense band, but early albums like Bewitched and Penthouse ballasted their whispier tendencies with Wareham and Sean Eden's searing guitar duels and spiraling VU/TV riffs, which have now changed from sparring matches into polite conversations. They still do lovely things-- see the closing moments of ""Star-Spangled Man"" for a glimpse of the fire that once burned regularly from these fingers-- but Rendezvous by and large is an intimate, close-listening affair, stuffed with hushed, rewarding melodies, subtly lulling backing vocals from bassist Britta Phillips, and the occasional surprising textural ripple. Wareham could never be accused of being a gifted vocalist but at this stage of his life, he's learned to tailor what he sings to fit his natural instrument, and his relaxed, steady nonchalance puts the right spin on his lyrical wit and self-deprecation. Eden takes the mic on two songs here, too, and he makes the most of it-- particularly when his Jason Lytle-ish tenor climbs to a spellbinding falsetto in the gorgeous chorus of the impeccably spacey ballad ""Broken Chair."" Impeccable is really the order of the day, as every note feels well-selected from a matching set, and even when the band kicks up the tempo-- as they do on ""Astronaut""-- they demonstrate restraint. Drummer Lee Wall, usually filling in space with his brushes and generally staying out of the way, gets to let loose a bit on the song with a barreling motorik beat as Wareham wryly references the Tamil Tigers in his worshipful/self-effacing entreaties to a lover. As note\xD0perfect as it all is, though, it's also a tad predictable, and the pretty slide guitar interjections and melodic rhythm guitar parts add up merely to the sum of their parts, which is impressive but never transcendent. Seriously though, if you're a Wareham fan, you're unlikely to be disappointed. Luna's discography-- lackluster live album aside-- has been remarkably consistent, with a few high peaks but nary a valley in sight, and Rendezvous continues that trend. All of the members already have other projects in the works (Philips and Wareham have already released a side album as a duo), and it seems as though they will put Luna rather quickly behind them. I'm sad to see them go, but I'm glad they went out strong.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4919-rendezvous/,Jetset,2004.0,"If you're a fan of rock music, you've likely heard of Luna - an alternative rock band hailing from New York City. Their sound is highly distinct and recognizable, blending elements of dream pop and indie rock with a touch of psychedelic flair. Their 1992 album, Rendezvous, is a prime example of their unique style and is a must-listen for any music lover.

Luna formed in the early '90s, with Dean Wareham on vocals and guitar, Justin Harwood on bass, and Stanley Demeski on drums. Since their inception, the band has been praised for their imaginative and surreal lyrics and the intricate, layered sound of their music. With Rendezvous, they solidified their place as one of the most innovative rock groups of their time.

The album was a highly collaborative effort, with the band working closely with producer Bryce Goggin to create a sound that balanced their signature dreamy, hazy quality with a more upbeat and energetic feel. From the opening track, ""Malibu Love Nest,"" the listener is immediately transported to a world of beachy vibes and sunny melodies. The album progresses with tracks like ""Cindy Tastes of Barbecue"" and ""Hedgehog,"" which further showcase the band's ability to craft unique and catchy melodies.

But what truly sets Rendezvous apart from other rock albums is Luna's incredible ability to paint vivid pictures with their lyrics. ""Whispers"" is a standout track that perfectly captures the feeling of romantic intrigue, with Wareham's soft, crooning voice painting a picture of love and intimacy. ""Moon Palace"" is another highlight, with its surreal lyrics and swirling guitar riffs creating a sense of otherworldly beauty.

As someone who has listened to Rendezvous countless times, I can confidently say that this album is a true masterpiece of modern rock. Luna's ability to create a sound that is both otherworldly and deeply emotional is unmatched by any other band in the genre. Their ability to capture the feeling of a moment or a mood in a song is nothing short of extraordinary. 

In conclusion, Rendezvous is a must-listen album for any fan of rock music. Luna's innovative sound and imaginative lyrics are sure to leave a lasting impression, and the album as a whole is a testament to their status as one of the most innovative and influential rock bands of the '90s.

Various Artists,Suicide Squad: The Album,,4.0,August 9 2016,Chris Randle,Contributor,"John Ostrander began publishing the modern *Suicide Squad *series in May 1987, two months after Ronald Reagan broadcast his fatherly confusion about all that money sent to Nicaragua’s Contras. Gathering second-rate supervillains for a covert-ops team was both a reaction to the cynical politics of the era and an editorial necessity—you can show Captain Boomerang committing atrocities Batman never could. Movie soundtracks often feel similarly calculated: Some antiheroes get coerced into serving their government, and others form an unlikely partnership for the *Spawn *OST. You have an excuse to bury your worst material, or an opportunity to reconsider it. Following in the tradition of Judgment Night and Blade II, the *Suicide Squad *album tries to bring musical strangers to happy disagreement. The affection holds, for a moment. If Skrillex had a secret origin, it would probably involve rock, techno and rap pooling in mutant coils at some point during the late ’90s, so pairing him up with Rick Ross for “Purple Lamborghini” is almost intuitive. And Ross sounds more energetic than he has in a while, the bass clawing down to his lowest frequencies. “Sucker for Pain” is credited to “Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa & Imagine Dragons w/Logic & Ty Dolla $ign ft. X Ambassadors,” a gloriously generic pileup of royalty negotiations featuring Dragon man Dan Reynolds moaning: “I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down/I’m a slave to your game.” That’s just called being a switch. The best contributions here go to approximate extremes. The R&B singer Kehlani delivers lyrics as measured intimacies, and on “Gangsta” her voice slows to a mantra: “You got me hanging from the ceiling,” her high notes sounding both captivated and frustrated. With its whispered taunts, its guitars testing the constant drum machine like a blade, “Medieval Warfare” is Grimes’ most direct attempt to salvage the aesthetic of nu-metal. Panic! at the Disco’s Brendon Urie has the voice to bring off “Bohemian Rhapsody,” but that also encourages their cover’s reverence (for a moment I wondered whether the backing vocals were sampled from the original). The pleasure of “Bohemian Rhapsody” is its indifference to anybody else’s notions of taste, brandishing worthy historical references as preposterous camp, giving the metalheads pseudo-opera. Meticulously recreating that feels somewhat misguided, like annotating a joke. According to anonymous-but-entertaining reports, Warner executives panicked after the first *Suicide Squad *teaser blew up online—instead of that hyper-saturated splatter, the actual film consisted of interchangeable paramilitary types looking drab in the rain. They hired back the trailer company to help with a different parallel cut, using familiar music cues to staple the final hybrid together. Listening to the *Suicide Squad *soundtrack resembles that experience, minus most of the hits. What you find is portentous covers, gun effects borrowed from a Joker toy, and Twenty One Pilots, a band whose singer addresses the microphone like his loyal pet rat. They don’t even rise from irritating to villainous, unless you have the misfortune of programming a modern-rock radio station. The presence of Eminem’s “Without Me” is telling: Once a wrecker of civilization, now the bully who couldn’t even go after ‘NSync collectively. *Suicide Squad *wants to show you around its twisted mind so badly you would think the mortgage just defaulted. The earlier Batman films reckoned with far more vivid forms of ugliness, whether the brutalist pandemonium that Tim Burton and Anton Furst devised or Joel Schumacher’s daubs of neon, but then they also had reference points beyond existing nerd media. (And *Batman Forever *had “Kiss From a Rose.”) The new superhero universe is a cosmos of templates, endlessly elaborating on itself—which makes a soundtrack like Suicide Squad like the background music in a PowerPoint.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22137-suicide-squad-the-album/,Atlantic,2016.0,"The Suicide Squad: The Album soundtrack dropped on August 5th this year and I had to listen to it. As a fan of various genres, including nan, I was curious to see how this collaboration between different artists would turn out.

First, let's talk about the history of the Suicide Squad. The comic book series began in 1959 and has since become a household name. The Suicide Squad is a team of anti-heroes and villains assembled by the government to complete dangerous missions in exchange for time off their sentences. The 2016 film adaptation was an instant hit and showcased some of the most iconic characters from the DC universe.

With that said, the Suicide Squad: The Album was created to complement the movie's storyline and offer insight into the minds of its disparate characters. The album includes contributions from artists such as Skrillex & Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Panic! at the Disco, Wiz Khalifa, and Imagine Dragons, to name a few.

The album opens with ""Purple Lamborghini,"" a hard-hitting track from Skrillex & Rick Ross that immediately sets the tone for the rest of the album. This particular track channels the Nightclub feel of the movie and will get you dancing in no time. Wiz Khalifa & Lil Wayne's ""Sucker for Pain,"" pumps up the energy with a raucous chorus and an array of electrifying beats.

However, despite the star-studded cast, the album falls short in a few aspects. While the songs are well-produced, they fail to capture the essence of the Suicide Squad. The lyricism tends to be repetitive and generic, lacking the emotional depth that could have taken the music to the next level. Additionally, some songs feel disjointed from the overall tone of the album and are clearly included solely for commercial reasons.

Having said that, the Suicide Squad: The Album soundtrack is far from a disappointment. It's a solid collection of eclectic tracks that are catchy and uniquely different. While not for everyone, I appreciate the effort made to create a well-rounded album with different styles and influences. In my opinion, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Panic! at the Disco is the album's standout track. It provides the perfect change of pace, and their cover of the iconic 1975 hit is a fresh take that pays homage to the movie's themes.

Overall, I rate Suicide Squad: The Album 4.0 out of 10. It's an average album, but it does have some standout tracks that are worth the listen. If you're a fan of the Suicide Squad or just looking for something a little different, this album is worth checking out.","1.

Various Artists,Punk45: Les Punks: The French Connection (The First Wave of French Punk 1977-80),,6.6,January 2 2017,Louis Pattison,Contributor,"Soul Jazz’s Punk 45 series has made it its mission to chart the forgotten corners of punk rock, one seven-inch record at a time, training its magnifying glass on the obscure groups or regional scenes that familiar histories overlook. In particular, its more localized iterations suggest that how punk sounded depended very much on where its seeds fell. A Los Angeles installment turned up the decadent nihilism of the Germs and the snotty proto-hardcore of the Middle Class, while last year’s Akron, Ohio disc focused on the likes of Devo and the Rubber City Rebels, freak prophets of a curdled futurism that echoed industrial America’s decline. Now, Les Punks takes Punk 45 back across the Atlantic to chart what happened when punk landed in mainland Europe. Punk rock was born in New York and London, but France provided much of the genre’s intellectual and aesthetic grounding. Les Punks’ sleeve notes trace punk’s currents back to a number of sources in France’s rich countercultural history: to writers like Rimbaud and Voltaire, the vanguard art movements of Dada and surrealism, the erotic provocations of Serge Gainsbourg, and the leftist sedition of chief Situationist Guy Debord, whose Society of the Spectacle provided intellectual ballast for the student riots of 1968, and from there found its way to the Sex Pistols via manager Malcolm McLaren and designer Jamie Reid. Unquestionably too, the French have always had an ear for the cool shit. Les Punks also spotlights the role of figures like Paris-based Marc Zermati, whose label Skydog fostered early links with New York and London scenes, and even released a seminal punk-before-punk document in the shape of Iggy and the Stooges’ chaotic live album Metallic KO. But in 1976, France had no pioneering rock‘n’roll tradition of its own, and a fair bit of Les Punks veers towards the imitative. The French groups clearly adored the dandyish side of New York punk—and man, did they dig Iggy. Angel Face’s “Wolf City Blues” is pure Stooges yowl and growl, with lashings of Ron Asheton-style wah-wah, while Fantomes’ cover of “I Wanna Be Your Dog” is too straight—a slavish, puppy-dog take on the original rather than a rabid leg-humper in its own right. Meanwhile, Dogs’ “Here Comes My Baby” and a couple of singles by Marie Et Les Garçons ably channel the more rocking NYC groups—the New York Dolls, Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, the Modern Lovers—with lots of enthusiasm but not much in the way of innovation. Elsewhere, though, there’s evidence of young French groups carving out a distinctive local sound. Perhaps the quintessential French punk group is Métal Urbain, who made the bold move of swapping out live bass and drums for a synthesizer and drum machine. 1977’s “Paris Maquis” —which holds the honor of being the very first single ever to be released on Rough Trade Records—is a blast of caustic guitar and teeth-grinding rhythm box clatter that set a blueprint for future synth-punk groups (notably, Steve Albini’s Big Black). Unlike many of their peers, Métal Urbain sang in French—“So the Americans can’t understand us,” they told Search and Destroy in 1977. But even without much of a grasp of the language, you can get the gist of “Paris Maquis,” a tribute to the French Resistance fighters of World War 2: “La ville resiste terroriste… Fasciste!” Indeed, there’s an argument to be made that French punk was post-punk at its inception—modish, intellectual, already finding ways to rewire punk’s familiar formulas. Charles De Goal, the solo project of one Patrick Blaine, contributes “Dance Le Labyrinthe,” an early example of the emergent cold wave sound powered by clip-clopping drum machines, spasms of electronic noise and vocals pitched at the brink of hysteria. “Mind,” by Nancy duo KaS Product, is turbulent electro-punk with a bravura performance from vocalist Mona Soyoc. Its take on mental instability and stifling social conformity may have been inspired by synth player Spatsz’s day job as a psychiatric nurse. And there’s a curiosity in the shape of the torrid, sexual “Sally,” by Gazoline—a band fronted by one Alain Kan, an androgynous, outwardly queer artist and addict who performed alongside Gainsbourg at the Alcazar Club before turning to punk rock. An enigma, he was last seen in 1990, taking a ride on the Paris Metro. His fate is unknown. It’s worth giving another shout to Les Punks’ sleeve notes, a fat 50 pages of essays and interviews that supply precious context, plus extensive illustration from Bazooka—a “graphic commando” cell of radical French illustrators who, if you believe the rumors, boasted ties to the Baader-Meinhof gang. Track for track, there are compilations that cover French punk and post-punk with a better hit rate. The two volumes of Born Bad’s Des Jeunes Gens Mödernes lean further into the France’s homegrown coldwave and synthwave sound, and are better for it. But a snapshot of French punk’s first flush, Les Punks stands up. It’s the sort of time capsule that’s not quite ready to become a museum piece: loud and arrogant and ready to create a spectacle.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22665-punk45-les-punks-the-french-connection-the-first-wave-of-french-punk-1977-80/,Soul Jazz,2016.0,"Bonjour fellow music enthusiasts! Today we're going to delve into the world of punk music in France in the late 70s with the album ""Punk45: Les Punks: The French Connection (The First Wave of French Punk 1977-80)"" by Various Artists. This album captures the raw energy and rebellious spirit of French punk music at its inception and serves as an important historical document in the chronicles of punk music.

First things first, let's talk about the history and creation of this album. The 70s were an exciting time for music in France as young people were eager to express their frustrations and desires through music. In the midst of the British punk explosion, French youths were quick to catch on and formed their own punk scene. This album is a collection of some of the most prominent and influential French punk bands of the time, showcasing their unique musical styles and attitudes.

One of the things that strikes me about this album is the diversity of sounds and styles on display. From the anthemic sing-along choruses of Marquis de Sade's ""Henry"" to the frantic energy of Metal Urbain's ""Panik,"" each track brings its own flavor to the table. Each band has its own distinct voice, with some leaning more towards the classic punk sound while others experiment with elements of new wave and post-punk.

Personally, I was particularly impressed with the album's opener ""No Fun"" by Stinky Toys. This song captures the frenzied energy and rebellious spirit of punk in its purest form. I found myself nodding my head and tapping my foot to the driving drums and gritty guitar riffs. Other standout tracks include ""Chantage"" by Guilty Razors, which features a catchy melody and sing-along chorus, and ""Le Jour Se Leve"" by Kas Product, which has a hypnotic quality that had me almost entranced.

All that being said, the album isn't without its flaws. Some tracks, such as ""Combat"" by Soggy, feel a bit derivative and don't add much to the overall picture. The album's production value is also a little rough around the edges, which is to be expected given the era and context in which it was recorded.

In conclusion, ""Punk45: Les Punks: The French Connection (The First Wave of French Punk 1977-80)"" provides a fascinating snapshot of the French punk scene at its inception. It captures the raw energy, frustration, and rebellion that defined the genre at the time. Though not every track is a gem, the album serves as an important historical document for fans of punk music and offers a diverse, exciting, and sometimes challenging listening experience. I give it a solid rating of 6.6 out of 10.","1. Review A contains more complex vocabulary and sentence structures compared to Review B.

Bun B,Trill O.G.,Rap,5.0,August 11 2010,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"Bun B was never meant to be a solo artist. As half of the great Texas rap duo UGK, Bun found his ideal complement in partner Pimp C. Bun brought the gravity and the technical prowess, and Pimp, besides being an incredible producer, had both the snarling fuck-the-world charisma and the expansive sense of vision that Bun always lacked. As a duo, they counterbalanced each other perfectly, Bun playing the sage big brother to Pimp's guttural loose cannon. And every time Bun has released a solo album, it's been at a time when Pimp was unavailable. (Pimp was in prison when Bun released 2005's Trill, and he died before the release of 2008's II Trill.) It's increasingly becoming obvious that Bun is somewhat adrift without his old partner. Trill and II Trill both had great moments, but they didn't work as unified albums. Instead, Bun adapted his style to his guests and producers, turning each LP into a patchwork of whatever was popular in rap that particular month. Trill O.G. works in much the same way-- except this time, Bun is all out of great moments, and it's less attuned to the styles he adapts. Throughout, he works in the same weary and vaguely clumsy cadence, never bringing the ebulliently eloquent verve he brought to his best UGK verses. Instead he merely seems to dutifully plug away every time he touches a mic. It's tough to imagine how a rapper as great as Bun has managed to turn out an album as consistently turgid and leaden as this. After all, it's not like he's forgotten how to rap-- so far this year he's put in impressive guest appearances for guys like Gucci Mane and Yelawolf. But on Trill O.G., that eternal baritone-rumble feels tired and beaten-down. He's no longer packing his verses with tricky internal rhymes, and everything he says feels like something he's said better before. Worse, he's developed a new tendency toward forehead-slap dumb punchlines: ""Go ask the white boys; they'll say you he's totally tubular/ Fuckin' bad bitches rub my dick against they uvula."" It's not a bad album, exactly. Bun's voice, even at its clumsiest, carries weight. It's fun to hear him on a DJ Premier beat on ""Let 'Em Know"", even if it's not the landmark event a 1996 collab between these two might've been. The many guests all seem to realize they're working with a legend, so everyone works hard. And it's a guest roster packed with stars. Very few rappers, after all, carry the same goodwill as Bun does within rap, and almost no others could wrangle two Drake guest spots in summer 2010. But the best songs here don't feel like they belong to Bun. Rather, ""Just Like That"" and ""Countin' Money"" feel like they belong, respectively, to Young Jeezy and to the Gucci Mane/Yo Gotti tandem, and Bun feels like a guest on his own songs. Besides that, there's a weird outdated feel to the album; too many of the songs feel like attempts to cross over to a rap mainstream that barely exists anymore. There's a reason that not too many people are recruiting T-Pain for choruses in 2010. And too many of the tracks come from the relatively unknown Texas producer Steve Below, whose beats feel like shallow parodies of the Houston rap that was popular five years ago. Bun doesn't have to make music this safe and leaden these days. In recent months, we've heard veterans like Big Boi and DJ Quik come with some of the most admirably weird records of their careers. But Bun is content to plug away at the same model, with diminishing returns. It's a shame.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14542-trill-og/,Rap-A-Lot,2010.0,"Hey there, music fans! Today, I want to talk to you about an album that has been on repeat on my playlist for a while - Bun B's ""Trill O.G."" This rap album by the legendary rapper Bun B has its highs and lows, with a rating of 5.0 out of 10. 

Before diving into the review, let's talk about Bun B's history in the music industry. He has been a part of the rap game since the 1990s and is a member of the iconic underground duo, UGK. Bun B has also contributed to numerous other artists' tracks and collaborated with legendary musicians like Jay-Z, Drake, and David Banner.

Now onto the album - ""Trill O.G."" tells the story of Bun B's life and career, with themes of family, loyalty, and self-reflection. The album features a variety of beats, from bass-heavy tracks like ""Let 'Em Know"" to more laid-back songs like ""Countin' Money All Day"".

One personal favorite of mine is ""Right Now"" featuring Pimp C and 2Pac. The track samples ""Hail Mary"", which was one of 2Pac's most famous songs, and hearing them both on the same track is a dream come true for any hip hop fan.

While the album has its moments, it also has a few low points. Some of the tracks fall short and feel repetitive, particularly towards the end of the album. However, the album's strengths definitely outweigh the weaknesses.

Overall, ""Trill O.G."" is a well-produced and deeply personal album that showcases Bun B's skills as an artist. If you're a fan of Bun B, UGK or southern rap, then this album is definitely worth checking out. It may not be perfect, but it's genuine and authentic - a true representation of the artist behind it.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed, whereas Review B is brief and less informative.

Thurston Moore,Rock n Roll Consciousness,Rock,7.7,April 28 2017,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"Though they personified the squall and squalor of 1980s Manhattan, Sonic Youth’s hearts always belonged to 1960s California. Starting with 1985’s Bad Moon Rising, Golden State roots both literal (see: Kim Gordon’s Los Angeles upbringing) and figurative (Lee Ranaldo’s Deadhead past) began to deeply entangle themselves in their knotty guitar gnarl. But where the Manson-inspired maelstrom of “Death Valley ’69” seemed to add another gallon of piss onto the grave of the hippie dream, the content and iconography of Sonic Youth’s subsequent work suggested they were secretly mourning it. The inner-sleeve artwork for 1986’s EVOL found Thurston Moore posing like a flower child with a sitar, while a scrawled crucifix insignia—emblazoned with the words “Sonic Life”—evoked the DIY religiosity of West Coast free-love cults. And with 1987’s Sister, Sonic Youth produced the most Californian album in their canon, from the desecrated Disneyland photo on the cover to the specific geographic references, not to mention the song that proved to be the closest Gordon and Moore would ever get to their own “I Got You Babe.” After flirting with mainstream success in the early 1990s, Sonic Youth more or less carried themselves as a post-punk Grateful Dead, becoming a modern paragon of hippie-era artistic freedom but without the incense, hacky sacks, and wavy-arm dancing. This summer marks the 30th anniversary of Sister, but in lieu of a big deluxe reissue campaign, Moore has surfaced with a solo record that similarly exhibits outer aggression as a means to achieve inner bliss. While Moore’s most recent work has seen him unleash his latent activist streak, Rock n Roll Consciousness uses its noisy guitar jams as battering rams to access more intimate, spiritual modes of expression. The title is no misnomer—on Rock n Roll Consciousness, Moore is consciously rocking, with the returning cast of guitarist James Sedwards, My Bloody Valentine bassist Debbie Googe, and Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley further solidifying the groundwork they laid on 2014’s The Best Day. But that sturdy foundation gives Moore the confidence to let his head float evermore freely into the clouds, atop some of the most joyous, optimistic lyrics he’s ever sung. Rock n Roll Consciousness is an album about love—if not an album of love songs per se. Moore isn’t singing to his girlfriend here—he’s addressing mythical goddesses and the mystique of big cities at night and the changing of the seasons. Like The Best Day, the new record features lyrical contributions from London poet Radio Radieux, whose cosmic vocabulary—with its references to “the prophetess,” “peyote walkers,” “magic drums,” and “vibration love”—allows Moore to mine the ecstatic without losing his ageless, dead-cool drawl. But if the album’s lyrics project a certain youthful idealism, musically, Moore and co. proudly dig their worn-out Converse heels into an indie-is-the-new-dad-rock ethos that trades in Sonic Youth’s abstract extremes for a tougher, more propulsive thrust. It’s more meat-and-potatoes, sure, but it’s really choice grass-fed beef with yam flan. “Exalted” unfurls like the Feelies playing at 16 rpm, before Sedwards starts channeling J Mascis channeling Eddie Hazel on what sounds like a meditative rendition of Neil Young’s “Like a Hurricane.” This melancholic reverie is rudely interrupted by a doom-metal drone that hits like a flaming gong crash, blazing the trail for Moore’s star-struck vocal to finally come in just before the eight-minute mark. “Aphrodite,” meanwhile, feels like an entire song spun out of the staccato, pin-pricked climax to “Marquee Moon,” until Googe’s hypnotic bass breakdown goads Moore and Sedwards to engage in some wah-wah warfare. Where The Best Day proffered a somewhat uneven mix of extended odysseys and rough-hewn sketches, Rock n Roll Consciousness is much more cohesive and smoothly sequenced. Its five tracks (averaging eight minutes a piece) feel like carefully plotted epics rather than improvised excursions; the revved-up 10-minute thriller “Turn On,” in particular, is packed with hairpin twists and turns. But Moore can also reach euphoric peaks through a more direct route. “Cusp”—a cloud-parting ode to the coming of spring—is six-and-a-half sustained minutes of shimmering jangle and steady, shuffling rhythm. The song is simultaneously frantic and soothing; like a jogging-on-the-spot exercise, the surroundings may not change, but by the end, your heart is pounding and you feel light-headed. It’s the moment where this album’s core philosophies achieve their purest physical manifestation. As Moore would attest, rock’n’roll—like love itself—should instill a higher state of consciousness, while at the same time make you feel like you’re losing it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23150-rock-n-roll-consciousness/,Caroline,2017.0,"Get ready to be transported to another dimension with Thurston Moore's 'Rock n Roll Consciousness.' As a long-time fan of Moore's work with Sonic Youth, I was excited to dive into his latest solo album that was released back in 2017. 

The album starts with the track ""Exalted,"" which is a stunning instrumental piece with a blissful guitar melody that set the perfect tone for the rest of the record. Then, ""Cusp"" follows with a thumping bassline and Moore's signature vocals that are both calming and captivating. It’s a song that has a slow build, but the release at the end is utterly satisfying. 

Overall, the album has a dreamy quality to it, with layers of guitars and ethereal vocals. While it's somewhat reminiscent of early Sonic Youth, Moore's solo work has a more minimalist approach in terms of instrumentation. It allows the listener to focus on the lyrics, which are full of poetic imagery and thought-provoking ideas.

The album's creation story is quite an intriguing one. As Moore has explained in interviews, it was recorded in just four days with longtime Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley and My Bloody Valentine bassist Debbie Googe. It was also produced by Paul Epworth, who had previously worked with Adele and U2. The chemistry between the musicians is evident in the seamless way they work together to create a unified yet complex sound.

As a fan of rock music, I appreciate how Moore experiments with the genre, incorporating elements of psychedelia and even some jazz-inspired guitar riffs. It's a refreshing take on rock and roll that doesn't rely on the typical guitar solos or drum fills. 

While some might find 'Rock n Roll Consciousness' to be too esoteric, I think it's an album that rewards repeated listens. There are so many intricate details that you might miss on the first go-around, but the more you listen, the more you pick up on those sonic gems.

Overall, I'd give 'Rock n Roll Consciousness' a solid 8.5/10. It's a testament to Moore's artistry and a captivating journey through his musical consciousness.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed than Review B.

JJ DOOM,Bookhead EP,Rap,8.0,May 30 2017,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"*Key to the Kuffs *has aged into excellence in the nearly five years since it first came out. It can still feel a little weird hearing MF DOOM with a couple MPH off his fastball, but that only puts more stink on his trick pitches—like his how’d-he-rhyme-that internals and a thematic villainy that’s never felt more at home on some off-the-grid corner of the Deep Web. And while Jneiro Jarel never went as far afield as Madlib or subverted classic hip-hop and R&B like DOOM’s own production did, his beats weren’t afraid to be at least a bit unnerving—just a notch below the potential to be an Organized Noize for the West Coast bass crowd. It might’ve been the *Butter Edition *that made it a bit clearer: Released a year after the original August 2012 pressing of Key to the Kuffs, the limited edition expanded reissue tacked on a bonus disc with four outtake tracks and five remixes that brought in some serious indie-crossover star power. That disc got another limited run on its own as a 12” picture disc half a year after that, and while it wasn’t exactly impossible to find, it seems like it nearly slipped through the cracks. That release, the *Bookhead *EP, is getting another lease on life from Lex Records. It’s not really any different from the *Butter Edition *bonus/2013 12” that came out a few years back, but it deserves another go-round as one of the best releases to feature DOOM’s name this decade. As a short but potent dose of hook-free haranguing, the title track has aged into a strong fan-favorite deep cut with one of the better JJ beats to come from that whole collection. DOOM rapping about escaping from the grind by losing himself in reading (”From the mean streets of the ‘Can I get a dollar, dude?’/Above measure, the singular pleasure of solitude”) would be a pretty good public library PSA if Jarel’s beat didn’t lurk like the synthesized soundtrack to leafing through the poetry books of Aleister Crowley. “Pause Tape” is a little less focused, featuring DOOM at his most thematically free-associative (“Quicker than a sleight of hand, like, damn/Telepathy and telekinesis, faster than Instagram”). It’s also one of two tracks (along with the quickie “The Signs”) where Jarel has enough time on the mic to turn his workmanlike voice around a few unlikely turns of phrase (”Never compromise, keep it real/Never peek at you/Rolling through the jungle/Glowing eyes like a kinkajou”). Then there’s “Viberian Son,” the counterpart to the “Part II” instrumental that showed up on Key to the Kuffs. DOOM’s verse is practically a cameo, but his lines about talking to your kids instead of hitting them register more memorable than Del the Funky Homosapien’s scattershot phrases. ”Bookhead” aside, and no slight to Jarel, the major draw here is the collection of remixes that fill out the EP’s later stretch. The indie/art-rock contributions ramp up DOOM’s griminess in oblique ways without losing sight of the fact that the tracks are supposed to knock. Dave Sitek collabed with Jarel on one of the better remixes on 2010’s *Gazzillion Ear *EP, and that formula pays off again with the Sitek remix of “Rhymin Slang.” More a customization than a transformation, it pares back the synth riff that made the original seethe and foregrounds the tape-hiss low end and adds some more expressive drum kicks and a brief Latin percussion breakdown that gives the UK-banished DOOM a postcard from New York. Jonny Greenwood and Thom Yorke turn the unlikely target “Retarded Fren” into a lurching chamber music nerve-rattler that toes the orchestral line between suspense-thriller score and “Looney Tunes” gag. And the plinky, clunky robot piano funk of Beck’s take on “Banished” is Exhibit Q of what he could do if he decided his *Midnite Vultures *mode was more worth resurrecting than Sea Change. That said, the two most fascinating remixes are the ones that inspire what-ifs, coming from two acts known for putting distinctive fingerprints on their production work for rap artists. BADBADNOTGOOD have done more thrilling work in recent years than their remix for “Guv’nor,” but it still fits DOOM’s more diabolical side. And “Bookfiend,” the title cut reworked by Clams Casino, gives us a glimpse at the villain in Jack Kirby mechanized Day-Glo environs, cloud rap where the atmosphere’s laced with crackling cosmic rays. Either one of these acts could make for a revelatory full-length collab with DOOM, new frontiers for a vet who feels weathered by experience without necessarily feeling straight-up old. For now, we’ve got one-offs like the ones on this EP to keep us guessing—which is what DOOM does best, anyways.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23263-bookhead-ep/,Lex,2017.0,"The rap game is always looking for emerging talent that can combine strong storytelling with hard-hitting beats. JJ DOOM is one such underground rap duo that has created a niche for themselves in the music world. Their latest album, 'Bookhead EP,' is a testament to their artistic expression and creativity, and it's not hard to see why it's garnered an 8.0 out of 10 rating.

For those who may not know, JJ DOOM is comprised of mastermind producer Jneiro Jarel and enigmatic rapper MF DOOM. MF DOOM is known for his unique flow and storytelling ability, while Jneiro is a master at crafting intricate and layered beats. Together, they make a formidable duo, and 'Bookhead EP' is the latest proof of their talents.

The album opens with ""Banished,"" where MF DOOM's effortless rhyming takes center stage. His laidback flow over the intricate beat is infectious, and it's the perfect start to what's to come. The EP's sound is reminiscent of classic hip-hop, with grimey samples and beats that are perfect for head-nodding.

The EP is a tribute to literature, specifically the works of Cormac McCarthy. MF DOOM has always been a master storyteller, and his love for literature is evident in his lyrics. He weaves tales of passion, heartbreak, and bravado, all while referencing McCarthy's works, such as 'Blood Meridian' and 'The Road.' It's an interesting concept that makes the album stand out from the crowd.

I particularly enjoyed the track, ""Pause Tape."" It's a slow-paced track, with an emphasis on the percussion and vocal samples. MF DOOM's flow on this track is impeccable, and the combination of his lyrics and the music create a hypnotic effect. It's a perfect representation of the overall vibe of the EP.

Overall, JJ DOOM's 'Bookhead EP' is an impressive addition to their discography. The combination of Jneiro Jarel's clever production and MF DOOM's storytelling ability creates an immersive experience that is worth revisiting. It's not an album that will blow you away with bombastic beats or catchy hooks, but rather an album that requires close attention to truly appreciate. If you're a fan of underground hip-hop or just looking for something different, I highly recommend giving this EP a listen.","1.

Ted Leo and the Pharmacists,Living With the Living,"Electronic,Rock",7.5,March 21 2007,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"Ted Leo, one of rock's last great intellectual populists, likes to throw you. Now on his fifth album, Living With the Living, the thirtysomething rocker still prefers the same music he's probably loved since his teens: the smarty-pants punk and new wave of turn-of-the-1970s UK labels like Stiff; the amped-up rhythm'n'soul of 60s mod and ska; the rangy heavy rock of Thin Lizzy; the hard-strumming folksiness of 80s indie; and the idealism impressed on him by American hardcore. The Pharmacists' oeuvre is all of a two-toned piece, but each record stands on its own, just different enough from its predecessor. So while I haven't lived with Living for very long, it's steadily grown on me, making me want to rave louder about it than it may deserve. Call me a booster rather than a critic, but I love Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and seriously want this band be, like, fucking huge. But at the same time, and call me old-fashioned, it's honorable the way Leo has opted to grow his audience and his songwriting talent organically-- and watch both increase exponentially, on his own terms. I like that he's got ethics and ideals that go beyond lifestyle choices. I like that he sees writing the most compassionate song possible about eating disorders as a political act, because it is. And with its airtight rhythm section and the crackling energy of its bug-eyed frontman in his Conflict T-shirt, no rock band currently touring puts on a better live show than the Pharmacists. On stage is where the looser songs of Living With the Living will ultimately live or die. More expansive-- for better or worse-- and prettier than anything Leo's done yet, the record is most closely related to 2001's The Tyranny of Distance, which was the sound of R.E.M.-style jangle stretched tight until it turned to punk. Like most punk lifers, Leo's music expresses a big-hearted emotional openness, but sonically, punk has also made him a solid editor, suspicious of bullshit ornamentation. ""The Sons of Cain"" is one of the better examples of his skill here: Its driving cowpunk finds flashes of Chuck Berry in Leo's licks, handclaps, and a sharp piano run tucked neatly in the mix, plus some ecstatic, throat-shredding whooping at the climax. As usual, Leo knows how to start strong, too, opening Living with three sure shots in a row-- especially ""Army Bound"", with its wicked solo. Leo's always had a bit of guitar hero in him, usually confining it to the one- or two-note rave-ups that smart punk bands hold to the fade-out. But where he once shaved his songs to their communicative essentials, here he's getting loose, mostly because when bands get suppler, more responsive, and more technically accomplished they're apparently entitled to stretch out. Like, you know, the Clash. It's an old rock band move that fails as much as it succeeds. For example, after four minutes of actual song, the outro to ""The Lost Brigade"" is three-and-a-half minutes of one note-- and not a particularly engaging note, either. You can skip the reggae trifle ""The Unwanted Things"", a momentum-killer on an album with an already wobbly sense of pacing. You can also pass over the awful political jeremiad ""Bomb. Repeat. Bomb."", which my Leo-loving drinking buddy disparagingly described as Blink 182 trying to be Crass (though I wouldn't be that rude to either Crass or Blink 182). Strangely, for such a sharp political eye and such an obvious humanist as Leo, the lyrics seem to be attacking the young bomber pilots, not the political quagmire that put those bombers in the air. And though Leo's fingerpicking is lovely and the melody's memorable, the tin whistle break in ""A Bottle of Buckie"" verges on Celtic kitsch. When playing to his strengths, though, Leo's songwriting is as strong as ever. Joe Strummer would appreciate the riffs on ""Who Do You Love?"", which climaxes in a stirring outro straight out of ""Safe European Home"" and indulges Leo's own mannerisms to great effect. (See also the short, sharp ""The World Stops Turning"".) ""The Toro and the Toreador"" should have been the album's closer; it's the climatic, rousing yelp of Tyranny's ""You Could Die (Or This Might End)"" with years of experience behind it, stretched out into a six-minute slow burn that milks the peaks of big melodramatic ballads for all they're worth. And ""La Costa Brava"" may be the best thing the Pharmacists have recorded yet, Leo's version of an epic, radio-ready, quiet/loud/quiet modern rock song. So despite a pretty high hit/miss ratio, as a big-step-forward record, Living ain't exactly Armed Forces. Maybe that's because, instead of being in thrall to fastidious (for which you can read ""British"") writers of single-length punk songs, Living often sounds like Leo's most American record to date, its unabashed big-ness more like Jersey boy Leo is still living under the towering shadow of the dude who made Born to Run. And like Bruce, to whom he's frequently been compared and whom he's covered live, even when Leo's attempts at big statements and big songs flop on Living, that same big-hearted openness makes you want to, rightly or wrongly, forgive his excesses. Even at his most impassioned and over the top, you never catch glimpses of Leo molting at some point into Bono. But I continue to slot Leo in the ""hero"" column, and despite Living's indulgences and occasionally soggy bottom half, I also continue to wish him well in his quest to win the world over, one kid at a time.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10018-living-with-the-living/,Touch and Go,2007.0,"Ted Leo and the Pharmacists have created yet another captivating album, ""Living With the Living"". This blend of electronic and rock music is a soul-stirring collection of 13 tracks that takes us on a journey through the band's unique musical sensibilities.

The album opens with the aptly named track ""The Sons of Cain"", which sets the tone for the rest of the album. It's a high-energy song with a rock feel that showcases the band's prowess in crafting catchy and meaningful melodies. Throughout the album, the band never wavers in its ability to deliver thought-provoking lyrics, full of social and political commentary.

Ted Leo and the Pharmacists are no strangers to the music industry, and it's no surprise that ""Living With the Living"" is another exceptional work. Leo started performing in the late '80s in a band called Citizen's Arrest before joining Chisel in the early '90s. He then formed Ted Leo and the Pharmacists in 1999 with James Canty, Chris Wilson, and Jodi V.B.

While the band's history is impressive, it's the album story that draws us in. Recorded in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Leo was inspired by the survivors' stories and experiences. The album is the result of Leo's desire to write music that reflects the resilience and perseverance of those who lived through the disaster.

The standout track on the album is ""Bomb, Repeat, Bomb"", a song with electronic beats and powerful lyrics that serve as a rallying cry for those who seek change. The song's chorus is especially catchy, and it's hard not to find yourself singing along.

Personal experience wise, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to ""Living With the Living"". The band's electronic and rock music blend makes for an immersive experience, and the lyrics are thought-provoking and meaningful. I felt myself nodding along in agreement with Leo's commentary on the world we live in today.

Overall, ""Living With the Living"" is a standout album from a band that has cemented their place in the music industry. This album is both timely and timeless, with lyrics that will resonate with listeners for years to come. From start to finish, it's a captivating journey that leaves the listener wanting more.

Âme,Fabric 42,Electronic,6.9,February 25 2009,Tim Finney,Contributor,"Âme's career has been a long voyage into sternness-- from 2005's eerie classic ""Rej"" onwards, the German duo have progressively shed the playfulness and levity of their prior lush disco-house blueprint. In most cases they've gained more than they lost: From the shamanic trance of 2006's ""Where We At"" (in collaboration with Henrik Scwharz and Dixon) to the dynamic surge of 2007's ""Balandine"" and ""Enoi"", the increasing seriousness of Âme's aesthetic is never in vain. In fact the portentousness of their sound is of the best sort, not so much awesome as itself awed and alienated by some apocalyptic vision somewhere off-screen. But in taking this route, Âme are swimming against the tide, discovering the strange joy of masochistic submission at the same time as their peers retreat further into the safe harbor of deep house re-re-revivalism. So while 2007's Coast 2 Coast mix was a near-perfect document of the latter impulse (reveling in the soft warmth of deep house old and new), they spend much of Fabric 42 carefully retracing the steps of a scene that is abandoning them, offering up a combination of viscous minimal techno and rigorous tech-house; the vibe starts off anxious, ends up muscular, and on the way somehow bypasses ""sexy"" and ""soulful"" altogether. Fabric 42 certainly shares Coast to Coast's lack of pretension, more interested in constructing a cruisy, enveloping feel than making any kind of statement or wowing with its diversity; but whereas the easy gentility of Coast to Coast's deep house sound made it a charming home listening or dinner party staple, Fabric 42 is just hard-edged enough to seem slightly ill-suited to any context other than the dancefloor itself. All of which serves to make Fabric 42 appear rather inessential, and I must confess that I found it hard to pay adequate attention at first. It doesn't help that Âme have deliberately avoided including any established or even potential bangers, with the exceptions of their own churning epic ""D.P.O.M.B."" (a homage to DJ Pierre's ""Wild Pitch"" early-1990s house sound, again composed in collaboration with Schwarz and Dixon) and the riveting old school techno classic ""Loop"" by LFO vs Fuse-- included at the end of this mix like a victory lap, the hour-long grimace of concentration relaxing into a broad, triumphant grin. Earlier, things can get a bit grim at times, although not always for the worse: The ungainly groove of Jens Zimmerman's ""Modmod Blubbblub"" is not at all helped by the pseudo-existential wordplay of its detached narrator vocal, but the far superior ""Raw Structure"" by Edward (seething old school house propping up an excoriating slam poetry vocal) shares the explosive furrow-browed intensity of its blueprint, Green Velvet's ""Preacher Man"". It's a grimness that has to sneak up on you to work. When I actively concentrate on the music, I want a lascivious diva vocal, an impudent piano riff, or a camp string arrangement to appear somewhere, anywhere; switch my concentration to something else, though, and the music's inexhaustible physicality takes on a compulsive power, locking in to the ""jack"" component of house with a fierceness you'd think would be beyond two effete German boys. And, as usual, Âme distinguish themselves with some inspired (if unflashy) transitions: the arrival of the skanking waterlogged drums of STL's ""Something Is Raw"" over the top of the fading acid bleeps of Armando's ""Don't Take It"" sounds so perfect, so exact in its unlikely mix'n'match, that the eventual emergence of the dominant organ riff on STL's track seems vaguely disappointing. The duo spend much of the second half of the mix alluding to their taste for all things ""Wild Pitch""-- a weakness they share with Tiefscwharz, who have plotted a similar stylistic trajectory from lush prettiness to riotous intensity. What's at stake here is nothing less than the function of dance music itself: unlike other current revivalist trends, Wild Pitch revivalism maintains a vision of house music as rave-flavoured and populist rather than soulful and specialist. This secret compact with hectic populism survives as a ghostly undercurrent even when Fabric 42 threatens to get a bit dour and greyscale, and it's that undercurrent that makes those moments worth sitting (or, better, scrubbing) through.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12696-fabric-42/,Fabric,2009.0,"If you're a fan of electronic music, you're probably not a stranger to the celebrated German electronic music duo Âme. The band has been known for its singular ability to create melodies that seamlessly intertwine with beats that have left an indelible impression on the evolution of electronic music.

Their skills are front and center on their fourth studio album, Fabric 42, released in 2008, which still holds up remarkably well today. The album is a perfect example of the artistic diversity that the duo is capable of creating with aplomb.

At the time of the release of Fabric 42, Âme was riding high on their previous album, ""Rej,"" a lulling deep house banger that solidified the duo's position as one of the best acts in the world. Fabric 42 was a follow-up to their first Fabric release, Fabric 36, and it was greeted with great anticipation and fanfare.

The album's creation story is a fascinating one, as it was a live session recorded over two nights. Ame showcased their exceptional abilities as DJs and live performers, effortlessly blending tracks from different genres to create a unique and cohesive whole. If you’re a music nerd, I recommend listening to this album on high-quality headphones to truly appreciate the mastery in the mixing.

The album is made up of tracks, including Charles Webster's 'Ready' and Parov Stelar's 'Crashpad.' The album is enjoyable from start to finish, with each track creatively building on the previous one to create a sonic experience that's both stimulating and varied. Each track's melody is meticulously crafted, with an expert hand for melody and composition.

What I love most about Fabric 42 is how unpredictable it is. The album takes a listener through a journey that's both thumping and otherworldly, with tracks that are euphoric and somber. It's hard to pinpoint an exact vibe or feeling that the album leaves you with, but it never disappoints.

Overall, I give Fabric 42 by Âme a strong rating of 6.9 out of 10. While it doesn't rank as high as Ame's previous studio albums, Fabric 42 is perfect for those searching for the musical intricacies of electronic music. It's a collection of tracks that are rich in depth and texture, easy to listen to, and not to be missed.","1. Review A has a more complex sentence structure and uses more descriptive language.

Calexico,Garden Ruin,Rock,8.1,April 12 2006,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"After nearly a decade spent playing together as Calexico, and with personal recording histories stretching as far back as 1988, Calexico's two principles are seasoned musicians who by now could just as easily stick to what they know and keep their fans happy and hungry for more. But as evidenced by their recent collaboration with Iron & Wine, and now by Garden Ruin, their fifth proper full-length (not counting collections like Aerocalexico or The Book and the Canal), they're more interested these days in pushing their boundaries and building on strengths. Garden Ruin is the most straightforward ""rock"" record they've made, and the differences between it and their previous releases are immediately discernable. I won't lie. I already miss Calexico's old mariach-indie rock sound and the rampant eclecticism that saw them jumping from jazz to flamenco dub to folk to icy dirges on 2003's Feast of Wire, but fortunately, the sounds that replace those bygone elements are just as satisfying. Garden Ruin is beautifully fleshed out and focused, retaining some of the duo's Southwestern elements but shifting the horn sound from Ciudad Juarez to Los Angeles. Here, Calexico economically blend jazz, country, American folk, and indie rock into concise, well-oiled pop songs, complete with gorgeous vocal layering that's popped up before in a more primitive state on tracks like ""Not Even Stevie Nicks..."" and ""Grip-Tape"", but is now fully formed. The stylistic change is evident from the album's opening notes, where an acoustic guitar figure that once might have fluttered through Spanish passages becomes a minor-key riff instead, sending the song speeding off on a brisk drumbeat as Joey Burns belts out twangy vocals. The meticulously detailed mix reveals interlocking acoustic and electric guitars, piano, glockenspiel, strings, and horns, before finally ending with Burns' layered falsetto wordlessly harmonizing with itself. The high harmonies on the verses of ""Panic Open String"" are absolutely beautiful, the mellifluous melodies and flowing steel guitar contrasting sharply with the much harder start/stop of the chorus. But Burns one-ups himself a few songs later, piling harmonies on ""Lucky Dime"" over Convertino's spryly shuffling drums to create a Technicolor pop nugget. ""Roka (Danza de la Muerte)"" finds that spooky corner Calexico have so often inhabited, with starlit acoustic guitar and arresting Spanish guest vocals. Its lyrics also offer pointed commentary on immigration, a rarity for this album, where the band's usual fixation on the politics of the border is largely supplanted by the politics of the heart: ""So close your eyes/ Slow your breath/ Dream of northern lights/ Around this dance of death."" By contrast, closer ""All Systems Red"" is epic. The song begins as a quiet acoustic tune, but morphs into a lurching monster as dramatic as anything the band has done to this point, guitars straining skyward, even as the chord progression descends and a maelstrom of noise reaches in to pull them down. Burns belts out from the middle of it with a power he's never harnessed before, and when it finally reaches the point of total overload, the rhythms give way to a gradual decay. It's a hell of an ending to a heck of a record, a display of sound and fury at which the duo has rarely even hinted. I'd never wanted Calexico to change, but the new direction suits them well, proving that even in the face of radical metamorphosis, they remain as stunning and distinctive as ever.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1234-garden-ruin/,"Quarterstick,City Slang",2006.0,"If you are a fan of rock music, you may have heard of Calexico, the Arizona-based band that has been making music for over two decades. Their music has always been a blend of genres, ranging from rock to country, and it is this versatility that has earned them a dedicated fan base all over the world.

Garden Ruin, their fifth album, released in 2006, is a departure from the band's previous albums. It is a more stripped-down and intimate album, with a focus on acoustic instruments and a more melodic sound. The band's usual use of horns and strings is toned down, allowing the vocals and guitar to take center stage.

From the opening track, ""Cruel"", it's obvious that Calexico has taken a more introspective approach to this album. The lyrics are deeply personal and reflect a sense of loss and longing, which are made even more poignant by the stripped-down instrumentation. The track ""Panic Open String"" has a catchy, sing-along chorus that belies its serious lyrics, while ""Nom de Plume"" is a moody, atmospheric track that showcases the band's songwriting skills.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""The News About William"", a hauntingly beautiful tribute to the late singer-songwriter Elliott Smith. It begins with a simple guitar riff, and gradually builds in intensity as the lyrics explore Smith's life and death. It's a touching, bittersweet moment that resonates long after the song has ended.

The album's title track, ""Garden Ruin"", is another highlight. It starts with a simple guitar riff and builds layer by layer, with a driving beat and soaring vocals that create a sense of urgency and purpose. It's a powerful statement of purpose from a band that is not content to rest on its laurels.

Overall, Garden Ruin is a mature, reflective album that showcases Calexico's songwriting and musical skills. The band's decision to focus on acoustic instruments and let the vocals take center stage has paid off, creating an album that is both intimate and powerful. Whether you are a long-time fan or new to the band, Garden Ruin is an album that is sure to reward repeated listening.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed than Review B.

Childish Gambino,Camp,Rap,1.6,December 2 2011,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"If you buy only one hip-hop album this year, I'm guessing it'll be Camp. The album maintains some of the overweening humor of Donald Glover's sitcom ""Community"", but Glover's exaggerated, cartoonish flow and overblown pop-rap production are enough to make Camp one of the most uniquely unlikable rap records of this year (and most others). What's worse is how he uses heavy topics like race, masculinity, relationships, street cred, and ""real hip-hop"" as props to construct a false outsider persona. On record, he paints himself as a misunderstood victim of cultural preconceptions who is obviously smarter and funnier than his primetime material suggests. Unfortunately, it's a position that holds up to absolutely no scrutiny whatsoever. Glover's not doing himself any favors with a rap handle taken from the Wu-Tang Name Generator, but that'd be easy to overlook if Camp functioned as anything more than a series of similar one-note gags. On a song-by-song basis, he scripts a slightly off-brand, fictional version of Kanye West being played for laughs. We could talk about Glover's bloodlines all day, but Childish Gambino's paternity test traces straight back to ""All Falls Down"". ""You See Me"" reimagines ""Niggas in Paris"" as a meme cemetery, with Glover painfully leaning into herniated punchlines like, ""She's an overachiever/ All she does is suck seed."" (Or maybe ""Asian girls everywhere... UCLA!"" will eventually end up on a T-shirt.) The bottle-service electro of ""Heartbeat"" could have been the 10th-funniest song on 808s & Heartbreak-- somewhere between ""The Coldest Winter"" and ""Love Lockdown""-- and it's actually trying for laughs. A few of Camp's tracks focus on more inspirational topics than ""making up for the fucks I missed in high school,"" but they usually emulate ""Jesus Walks"", or when trying to be slightly more humble,""Get By"". And any shred of relatability Glover establishes by reminiscing about sinkbaths with his cousin, or trying to fit into the white school his parents busted their asses to send him to, are cancelled out by R&B hooks so garish and impersonal they make Lupe Fiasco's Lasers sound dignified. Supporters may rush to praise Glover as a ""multi-talent"" due to Camp's self-production, but his cratedigging begins with The College Dropout and ends with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, all of it Blingee'd up with assistance from ""Community"" composer Ludwig Goransson. Yes, that's a lot of Yeezy talk, but the most insidious aspect of Camp is how Glover operates from a *pre-*Kanye inferiority complex where he senses that any dismissal of his music stems from gangsta rap still being the predominant aesthetic version of hip-hop (never mind that the most commercially relevant guy who can be feasibly be called ""gangsta rap"" right now is Rick Ross, and even he's widely beloved on account of being an acknowledged pathological liar). This much is obvious from the tone-deaf ""All of the Shine,"" and especially ""Backpackers"", a preemptive strike at his always-male, usually educated haters. Note how its title co-opts the one epithet more outdated than ""hipster"" in rap music circa 2011. Glover isn't strictly a comedy rapper, but he flows like a comic actor: When he's trying to be playful, his voice hitches in a pubescent squeak, and when he ""goes in,"" he's still delivering one room-clearing punchline after another with the earnestness of the most confused Rhymesayers guy ever. At the very least, Camp can serve as hashtag rap's tombstone, and I'll just present some choice quotes without comment so you can decide for yourself: ""I made the beat and murdered it, Casey Anthony,"" ""You can kiss my ass, Human Centipede,"" ""I got a girl on my arm, dude show respect/ Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech."" Every attempt Glover makes to present himself as an inside operative confounding stereotypes about mainstream rap rings totally false. In ""Fire Fly"", he brags about the ease of scoring college gigs and college girls (while rhyming ""LSU"" with ""molest you"") and then complains: ""No live shows because I can't find sponsors/ For the only black guy at a Sufjan concert."" Bullshit. OK, look: I realize that there's a chance some kid will hear that line and feel validated, and you know, the last thing we need is an armchair cracker like myself relating contrary anecdotal evidence about the demographics at Sufjan Stevens' last concert. So let's just look at the facts: Jay-Z and Beyoncé could be seen at Grizzly Bear shows in 2009, Justin Vernon has a free pass to jump on any track he chooses, and producers spent the year sampling Beach House, the xx, and Tame Impala. How does Glover explain Drake? Is he ""crazy or hood,"" or just a half-Jewish, former child actor from Toronto who's already sold 600,000 copies of Take Care while signed to Lil Wayne's record label? I mean, sub-major hip-hop isn't a post-cred, post-racial utopia by any means, but I can't think of another time when there were more options for listeners of just about any race or background seeking to identify with rappers on a non-allegorical level. I just have to assume Glover has completely ignored the success of Lil B, Main Attrakionz, Curren$y, Kendrick Lamar, Odd Future, Danny Brown, and especially Das Racist when he meekly moans, ""Is there room in the game for a lame that rhymes/ And wears short shorts and tells jokes sometimes?"" It's the perfect summation of Camp: preposterously self-obsessed, but not the least bit self-aware. Tell me that ain't insecure.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16074-camp/,Glassnote,2011.0,"I recently had the opportunity to dive into the rap album ""Camp"" by Childish Gambino, and it's safe to say that this album didn't quite strike a chord with me.

It's no secret that Childish Gambino has a long and storied history in the entertainment industry. Before breaking big in the rap scene, he found fame as a writer, comedian, and actor in shows like Community and 30 Rock. With ""Camp"", Gambino aimed to showcase his versatility and continued evolution as a rapper.

The album's creation story is an interesting one. Gambino has often spoken about feeling like an outsider throughout his life, and ""Camp"" was his attempt to address that feeling in a musical capacity. He drew inspiration from his own experiences growing up and attending a summer camp for the arts, infusing personal anecdotes into each and every track.

Despite the heartfelt inspiration behind the album, I unfortunately can't give it a particularly high rating. The production value is undeniably top-notch, but the lyrics and delivery tend to fall flat. Some tracks come off as cliched, boasting typical rap braggadocio without any real substance. Others offer up simplistic rhyme schemes that feel like they belong in a children's nursery rhyme book. The album's overall score of 1.6 out of 10 certainly feels appropriate.

However, it's important to note that music is subjective, and there are certainly individuals out there who will appreciate ""Camp"" for what it is. For me personally, the album didn't quite live up to its potential, but I can respect the concept and Gambino's honesty in sharing a piece of his own story.

In conclusion, ""Camp"" is an album with heart, but it unfortunately fails to deliver on a musical level. It's not my personal cup of tea, but it's worth a listen for anyone who enjoys introspective storytelling in the world of rap.","Step 1: Review A contains more complex language and sentence structures, including the use of rhetorical devices such as alliteration and humor.

Jhené Aiko,Sail Out EP,Pop/R&B,6.1,November 22 2013,Jordan Sargent,Contributor,"It is easy to see the feather-voiced R&B singer Jhené Aiko in the lineage of female artists whose music hinged on the paradoxical power of vocals that felt like an outgrowth of a whisper. There is Cassie, the one-hit wonder who eventually achieved near-idol status amongst electronic producers enchanted by the icy sensuality of her music, and there is Brandy, whose voice is much richer but who nonetheless found her songs being clipped and looped by the same sort of producers (Burial, James Blake). There is someone like Ciara and, of course, there is Aaliyah, revered now like a goddess thanks to the crushing emotionality of a voice that put her far out of step with the divas of the 90s. It is even easier to see how the recent adoration for these singers—not just from British boys clicking through Logic, but also from stars like Drake (who has an Aaliyah tattoo) and Chris Brown—may have provided a perfect incubator for an artist like Aiko, whose music attempts to hit you in precisely the same way. And it is true: the sustained interest in this sound has likely contributed to her rise, which culminated in Sail Out debuting in Billboard’s Top 10 debut. But more importantly, as the sound of popular rap has continued to take on a form (in mood if not always in sound) mutated from Kanye West’s 808s & Heartbreak, Aiko’s malleable and far from overpowering voice has become a frequent accompaniment. In 2013 she has starred on Big Sean’s hit single “Beware"", snaking her way through the track’s ample empty space, and on Drake’s “From Time""  joining Alicia Keys, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna as the only women to appear on any of his albums. (She is also currently opening for Drake on his American tour.) Despite not being a megawatt name, her inclusion on Nothing Was the Same almost felt like a foregone conclusion: no current vocalist—male or female— better accentuates the damp throb of Drake’s music. If you lie in bed at night in a pitch black room aglow only with the light of an iPhone, Aiko’s voice is the one that might feel the most appropriate. But being asked to help solidify the mood of a song is an altogether different task than carrying an entire project. Aiko has been around the industry for almost a decade, signing a record deal with Epic as a teenager and eventually surfacing on a number of Black Hippy projects, a pairing that makes perfect sense when you consider that Kendrick Lamar would eventually build a track out of a Janet Jackson sample. But in that time she’s put out only a single full-length, the 2011 mixtape Sailing Soul(s), which nonetheless featured contributions from Kendrick, Drake, Miguel and Kanye West. Sail Out is Aiko’s first release with the world watching. Though it is easy to grasp the broad appeal of Aiko’s music, it’s harder to decipher whether the songs are more appealing than the mere atmosphere they create. One issue she doesn’t have is establishing a clear point of view: on Sail Out, she sings exclusively of contentment being just out of her grasp, be it because a relationship is fractured emotionally (“3:16 am”, “WTH”) or by distance (“The Vapors”), or because she has to continue with the motions required of her profession (“Bed Peace”). Regardless, there is an unavoidable longing at the heart of this EP, one that seems connected to her fixation with weed. On “Bed Peace” she sings of a desire to wake up in the middle of the day and light a blunt, but the idea of intoxication is a metaphor she returns to often. On “WTH” she steps back from a sputtering relationship and realizes that she ""might've got way too high"" and on “The Vapors” she links drugs and sex, repeatedly singing “Can I hit it again?” It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that there is also a distinct numbness to Sail Out. The production—handled by Fisticuffs, a duo that worked heavily on Miguel’s first album—is downtempo and unobtrusive, with percussion coming from drums that are no louder than a snap or a clicking lighter and keyboards that offer a soft bed for Aiko’s vocals. Those vocals are often emotionless; Aiko sings with a medicated distance, never getting too up or too down even when she sings of despair. It is here where Sail Out is likely to leave some cold. Vocalists like Cassie or Aaliyah were able to convey a spectrum of emotions within a limited vocal range, summoning strength or giddiness or compassion when necessary. Aiko has yet to display this ability, and Sail Out leaves you searching for emotion where it isn’t. Instead there is a glazed-over blankness to her delivery that does these bare-by-design songs little favors. The EP’s best track is also its outlier. “Bed Peace” is powered by a bouncy, bright guitar strum that blossoms into a chorus of fluttering keyboards, radiant backing vocals, and screwed vocals that bob and weave with Aiko’s own singing. It is the most fully developed track, but more importantly the bliss seems to draw her into easing smoothly into a higher register. It is a subtle shift that feels too much like a revelation.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18777-jhene-aiko-sail-out-ep/,"Def Jam,Artium",2013.0,"Jhené Aiko's Sail Out EP marks a smooth transition for the singer-songwriter. It's an evolution from her earlier works to a more polished and refined style of Pop/R&B. Despite its decent rating of 6.1 out of 10, the EP still manages to make an impression on the listener.

For those not acquainted with the artist, Jhené Aiko is an American singer of Japanese, Spanish, and Dominican descent, known for her entrancing voice and piercing lyrics. Her debut mixtape, Sailing Soul(s), released in 2011, put her on the map. It was followed by her 2013 EP Sail Out, which was a precursor to her debut album, Souled Out.

The Sail Out EP, released in 2013, is a collection of seven songs that showcase Jhené’s style of music — soulful, mellow, and introspective. It includes collaborations with high-profile artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino, and Vince Staples, each adding their unique touch to the tracks.

""Bed Peace,"" featuring Childish Gambino, is a standout track on the album. It tells the story of a couple in love, who just want to relax in bed and escape from the world. The track's production is minimalistic, with guitar riffs and laid-back beats, allowing Aiko's voice to take center stage. ""The Worst,"" another fan-favorite, follows a similar pattern, with Aiko singing about a tumultuous relationship in a raw and honest way.

The EP's most significant strength lies in its ability to take the listener on a journey. From the opening track, ""The Vapors,"" to the closer, ""Comfort Inn Ending,"" listeners are taken on a ride, exploring all the elements that make up Jhené Aiko's music.

Overall, Sail Out EP might not be Jhené Aiko's strongest output, but it still packs a punch. It’s the perfect combination of honest lyrics, soulful beats, and captivating production that showcases the singer's evolution as an artist.

The Go-Betweens,That Striped Sunlight Sound,Pop/R&B,8.3,April 6 2006,Rachel Khong,,"After nearly 30 years of creating intelligent pop, Go-Betweens co-leaders Robert Forster and Grant McLennan are alive and very much kicking-- obscene levels of long-cultivated cultdom still intact. ""We're about the last band in the world that has not shot a DVD,"" Robert Forster announces between songs on DVD/CD combo That Striped Sunlight Sound, ""So we're doing one tonight, right here""-- which he of course pronounces ""hee-ya,"" in reference to the Tivoli Theatre in the band's hometown of Brisbane, Australia-- before diving appropriately into ""Streets of Your Town."" Reenacting here both the times they first immortalized looping entreaties to ""shi-i-i-iine,"" and complaints that, ""I still don't know what I'm here for,"" it's still clear what they're here for: 2005's Oceans Apart improved greatly on the Go-Betweens' previous comeback effort, and provides That Striped Sunlight Sound with its peppiest tracks: ""Here Comes a City"", ""Boundary Rider"", ""Born to a Family"", and ""Finding You"" are all extra-robust Red Bull anthems. But if pop's longtime sunshine-companionship is warranted, it makes tons of sense to call these vets the arbitrators of some striped sunlight sound. This live album comes like midday sun filtering through mini-blinds: barely-there slits, perfectly understated kind of cool (temperature-wise) sunny days alongside major chances of rain. And it comes with proof of what the Go-Betweens do best: the opposite of cloying-- perfectly aware, grown-up, and bittersweet. The low-key ""Black Mule"" and ""Clouds"" wouldn't otherwise resemble sold-out show material, but here-- spouted not from the mouths of babes but full-grown old dudes-- they're perfect, somehow. Sure we could gripe about the lack of favorites (where's ""Dive for Your Memory""?), but let's be grateful for what this is: After a long dry spell, ""Spring Rain"" has been a long time coming: ""Don't know where I'm going/ Don't know where it's blowing/ But I know it's finding you."" ""You"" meaning us, of course. Hand-clapped, whistled interims are proof that no band is an island, and the Go-Betweens are no exception to the rule: On That Striped Sunlight Sound, fans and cheesy concert-cheers are as indispensable as the guitars themselves. While those who accuse the band of overcultishness might cite the record's idiosyncratic and nerdy overload-- the Go-Bees, after all, perform debut 1978 single ""Karen"", call ""James Joyce"" the ""right choice,"" and namedrop great Russians in that dead-on line from Oceans Apart (""Why do people who read Dostoyevsky look like Dostoyevsky?"")-- there's something bigger and farther-reaching than geek rock at work here. Here's what potential and happiness sounds like in the face of rain, and God knows what else.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3480-that-striped-sunlight-sound/,Yep Roc,2006.0,"If you're looking for a musical journey that is both nostalgic and fresh, The Go-Betweens' album ""That Striped Sunlight Sound"" is definitely worth a listen. It's got a bit of an old school Pop and R&B feel that instantly transports you to a different era, while still managing to feel current and relevant.

A bit of history about the band: The Go-Betweens originally formed in Australia in the late 1970s but eventually relocated to London to pursue their dream of becoming a successful band. Unfortunately, much like many other talented artists, despite their efforts, they never quite achieved the mainstream success they were hoping for. However, their cult following persisted and they became known for their unique sound that blended elements of indie rock, alternative rock and pop.

This album came several years after a long hiatus for the band but the wait was well worth it. It was recorded in Brisbane, Australia, and released in 2005, with the songwriting talents of front men Robert Forster and Grant McLennan taking center stage. The album is a culmination of their experiences and tastes, and features the likes of Linda Neilson on cello and Adele Pickvance on electric guitar.

What's truly remarkable about this album is how fluid it is, despite featuring a mix of eclectic songs that run the gambit from bouncy pop to introspective ballads. That said, there are definitely some standout tracks that immediately caught my attention. The opening track, ""Here Comes a City"", is one of those. It's a somewhat melancholic tune, but it also has an incredibly catchy chorus that has been stuck in my head for days now. ""Darlinghurst Nights"" is another favorite, with its upbeat tempo and slick guitar work that will make you want to dance.

However, it's the album's slower tracks that really showcase the band's songwriting prowess. ""Finding You"" is a beautiful ballad with heartwarming lyrics and a subtle build that leads to a poignant climax. ""This Night's for You"" is another standout track, with its soft piano melody and haunting vocals that make it feel like a lullaby sung by a lost soul.

In terms of the R&B elements, they're most evident in the percussion and guitar work, with tracks like ""The Statue"" and ""Born To A Family"" lending themselves to sultry, soulful sounds. These songs, along with the rest of the album, showcase the band's versatility and ability to weave together different genres and sounds into one cohesive piece of art.

Overall, ""That Striped Sunlight Sound"" is an impressive album that is both accessible and sophisticated all at once. It's a testament to The Go-Betweens' legendary status in the indie rock world and their ability to create music that is both unique and timeless. Whether you're a die-hard fan or someone discovering their music for the first time, this album is a must-listen.","1.

Clipse,Road to Till the Casket Drops,Rap,7.6,December 11 2008,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"The first skit on the new Clipse mixtape is a genuine-sounding voicemail message from actress Lauren London. ""Can you make something for the girls?"" she asks. ""Like, we so pretty in our Louis Vuitton?"" One track later, the brothers Thornton repurpose the airily gorgeous beat from Slim's ""So Fly"" to snarl nihilistically empty sex-talk: ""Not do demean 'em, but that's just how we seen 'em/ Trading bitches off since balling was buying Zimas."" As the track ends, Pusha T cackles viciously: ""See, sis? We do girl records, right?"" Watch what you wish for, I guess. Thing is, once upon a time, Clipse were able to do girl records, or something like them, anyway, in a way that didn't just turn the songs into morbid jokes. With breakout single ""Grindin'"", Malice and Pusha established the dead-eyed coke-talk they're still running with six years later. But they also made ""When the Last Time"", one of this century's greatest club jams. On that and a handful of other Lord Willin' tracks-- songs released in 2002, when the duo had something to do with the commercial rap landscape-- Clipse seemed totally genuine talking about how club night was one of the reasons they loved life, and their cold monotones worked just as well on frothy dance-pop tracks as on harshly mechanical tough-guy shit. That was them on Justin Timberlake's ""Like I Love You"", after all. That Clipse is gone now. In the intervening years, they've left rap's mainstream behind completely, becoming internet cult heroes by diligently and eloquently pursuing two basic subjects: selling drugs and the money that comes with it. This has made for some ferociously exciting music, as on long-delayed sophomore album Hell Hath No Fury and the now-classic We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 2 mixtape. But they've been hammering away at those two subjects with single-minded focus for years now, and the wear is starting to show. It wouldn't be fair to call Road to Till the Casket Drops, their new mixtape, a disappointment. After all, this is a brisk half-hour of free new music from one of rap's greatest groups. The Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 3 mixtape, released earlier this year, dwelled hard on Fury's disappointing sales and leaned a bit too much on underwhelming original beats. But now they're back on their Vol. 2 shit, hijacking up-to-the-moment rap-radio fodder (featherweight synth-tracks like Ryan Leslie's ""Addiction"" and Ron Browz's ""Pop Champagne"", clattering trunk-rattle shit like ""Swagger Like Us"" and T.I.'s ""Swing Ya Rag""). More often than not, they blow away the originals. Re-Up Gang associate Sandman, the weakest link in the extended group, has left, and so now we get an undiluted blast of pure Thornton brothers along with a couple of guest appearances from Re-Up survivor Ab-Liva, whose verse over the ""Pop Champagne"" beat is a thing of breathless beauty. And Malice and Pusha just have incredible voices, precise and almost technically fussy flows that can drip with contempt like nobody since circa-1999 Jay-Z. So yeah, a new Clipse mixtape is always a good thing, well worth your half-hour and zero dollars. But Road to Till the Casket Drops finds Clipse spinning their wheels a bit. That's understandable; when you've spent years working hard to come up with convoluted cocaine punchlines, it makes sense that the well would be running dry. But every previous Clipse release, official and otherwise, was so jammed with great lines that it could be tough picking out moments to quote. On this one, the best line comes on the first track. Pusha: ""It's the hood's Obama, shoveling McCain/ Out the project windows, the drama's insane."" Pusha aims a few unwieldy darts at Lil Wayne, which seems a bit pointless; only Wayne is going to end Wayne's hot streak. ""Feds Taking Pictures"" starts with a long list of shoutouts to specific drug dealers, which isn't all that interesting unless you happen to be one of those drug dealers. Again, I'm mostly just quibbling here. This is a quickie mixtape intended to celebrate the launch of Clipse's new clothing line Play Cloths, which is unfortunately saddled with both one of the worst names and worst logos in rapper-clothing-line history. As a quickie mixtape, it beats the everliving fuck out of virtually all its mixhut competition. A lot of this stuff was probably recorded on a tight schedule, relatively tossed-off. But nothing these guys did used to sound tossed-off. And maybe by the time they release their next album (next year, lord willin'), Clipse should look beyond the corner and make a few tracks that don't revolve around white powder. Like, for instance, maybe some girl songs. Just a thought.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12496-road-to-till-the-casket-drops/,Self-released,2008.0,"There is something about Clipse that is absolutely magnetic. As soon as you press play, the rhythm and the rawness of their music captivates you, leaving you at once spellbound and energized. Their album ""Road to Till the Casket Drops"" is no exception - in fact, it showcases Clipse at their best.

For those who are uninitiated, Clipse is a rap duo composed of brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton from Virginia Beach, Virginia. They've been producing music since the late 90s and gained prominence in the early 2000s with their hit song ""Grindin'."" Their style is distinguished by their gritty beats and sharp, clever lyrics that paint vivid pictures of street life.

""Road to Till the Casket Drops"" was released in 2009 and was met with critical acclaim. The album was produced by The Neptunes, a production duo composed of Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, and features guest appearances from Keri Hilson, Kanye West, and Cam'ron, among others.

What is immediately apparent about this album is the consistency of the production. The Neptunes' beats are hard-hitting and immaculately crafted, providing the perfect foundation for Clipse's rhymes. The lyrics are unflinching, and the themes - the struggles and triumphs of life on the streets - are conveyed with striking honesty and depth.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""I'm Good,"" which features Pharrell Williams. The song is a defiant anthem about overcoming adversity and achieving success, even in the face of adversity. Clipse's verses are sharp and witty, and Williams' hook is a resounding affirmation of resilience and perseverance.

Another highlight is ""Popular Demand (Popeyes),"" which features Cam'ron. The beat is infectious and the hook is catchy, making this one of the most memorable tracks on the album. Cam'ron's verse is a perfect complement to Clipse's, adding a new dimension to the song's playful yet gritty vibe.

As for personal experience and opinion, I can confidently say that ""Road to Till the Casket Drops"" is one of the best rap albums I've ever heard. Clipse's style is unique, and their ability to conjure vivid images and emotions through their music is unparalleled. This album is a must-listen for anyone who appreciates raw, authentic hip-hop.

In conclusion, ""Road to Till the Casket Drops"" is a masterpiece of rap music. Clipse's uncompromising style, combined with The Neptunes' exceptional production, makes for an album that is both musically and lyrically excellent.

Tall Juan,Olden Goldies,Rock,6.2,May 16 2017,Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,"On “I Wish I Knew,” the fourth track on his full-length debut, Olden Goldies, Juan Zaballa shows that he can capture the speed and spunk of classic Ramones on an acoustic guitar. In no uncertain terms, his rhythms and vocal melodies telegraph from where Zaballa draws his influence. Just in case, though, the Buenos Aires-via-Far Rockaway singer/songwriter name-drops the legendary Forest Hills punks when he sings about “Sharing good times with you/Listening to Ramones.” As anyone who loves the Ramones can tell you, their music captures a powerful sense of nostalgia and by-gone innocence. Zaballa discovered the band at the ripe old age of 8, so it isn’t surprising that they have such a strong hold on him. Eight of the 15 songs on Olden Goldies are built on Johnny and Tommy Ramone’s signature groove, as Zaballa does his best Joey Ramone impression over top of them. Zaballa also favors a similarly naive mode of expressing himself. “I Wish I Knew,” for example, could be a love story straight out of the “Happy Days” era. “I know you like fruits, amusement parks too/And staying up all night,” Zaballa sings to his lost (presumably high school) sweetheart. On “Far Rockaway,” he references the subway ride to to the Queens neighborhood the Ramones immortalized on “Rockaway Beach.” But Zaballa knows he has to do more than simply cop the tone and style of his glue-sniffing, cretin-hopping heroes. He laces several of his riffs with off-color, borderline jazzy chords that would certainly have made Johnny Ramone wrinkle his nose in disapproval. Ironically enough, Zaballa breathes new life into lo-fi pioneer R. Stevie Moore’s introvert anthem “I Like to Stay Home,” by giving it a Ramones makeover and cutting it down to 43 seconds. Half of Olden Goldies is clearly indebted to the Ramones, and the other half shows Zaballa indulging his taste for garage psych. He accents most of his Joey Ramone-styled verses with a mic-distorting bark that suggests a bridge between the album’s two primary modes. But the song sequence alternates haphazardly between them, making for a disjointed listen. And Zaballa doesn’t follow-through on what could have been fruitful side detours: the ambient Rhodes-like piano swell at the end of “Another Juan,” for example. When Zaballa does veer off the path, such as on the cloud-like guitar-keyboard loop at the base of “Kaya” (a loving ode to his smoking substance of choice), it only highlights how much more variety he has up his sleeve. By Zaballa’s own admission, Mac DeMarco didn’t actually “produce” this album in the traditional sense, and it shows. Worse, the lack of production makes for a strangely colorless tribute to the rock’n’roll era. It’s odd to say about a pompadoured, rockabilly wildman who alternates between English and Spanish, but Zaballa’s records could use more of his own character.  Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Mac DeMarco engineered the album.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23073-golden-oldies/,BUFU,2017.0,"If there's one album that has been on repeat on my playlist this week, it's 'Olden Goldies' by Tall Juan. As a rock music enthusiast, I must say that this album is a breath of fresh air in the contemporary rock scene. 

Before delving into the music, let's take a quick look at the band's history. Tall Juan is an Argentinean-born singer, songwriter and guitarist whose journey into the rock music world began in Argentina, where he was initially part of a punk trio. In 2004, he moved to New York City, where he started his solo career as a busker in the subway. Over time, he built a following and made strong connections within the vibrant music scene in Brooklyn. 

Fast forward to 2021 and the release of 'Olden Goldies.' The inspiration behind the album is a mixed bag of his personal journey and experiences, which he conveys in his signature vintage rock sound while seamlessly blending Spanish and English lyrics. 

The album opens with 'It's True,' a catchy rock n' roll bop that sets the tone for the rest of the tracks. If I had to choose one standout track on the album, it would be 'I Don't Know What To Do,' a high-energy tune with an infectious chorus that will have you tapping your feet and singing along. Another notable track is 'Take It Easy,' an unpretentious, anthemic song with guitar riffs reminiscent of classic rock hits from the 70s. 

What sets 'Olden Goldies' apart from other rock albums is that it has a nostalgic feel, taking listeners on a trip down memory lane without trying too hard to be retro. Tall Juan's raw, gritty voice and guitar playing will have you transported back to a time when rock music was at its peak. 

If you're looking for an album that delivers an authentic rock sound with a dose of nostalgia, 'Olden Goldies' is a must-listen. Although it may not be perfect, with a rating of 6.2 out of 10, I would rate it higher. It's evident that Tall Juan put his heart and soul into crafting every track, making it an album that stands out among other contemporary rock releases.","1.

Iron & Wine,Archive Series Volume No. 1,Folk/Country,7.2,February 24 2015,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"In retrospect, there was no way that Sam Beam—or anyone else, for that matter—could keep singing such quiet, devastating songs. Recorded in his living room while he worked a day job teaching cinema in Florida, his early Iron & Wine material examined harsh truths about the precarious nature of marriage and family: Every child grows up and leaves home, every friendship is eventually defined by distance and difference, every marriage ends in death and loneliness. ""One of us will die inside these arms,"" he sang on ""Naked As We Came"", off 2004’s *Our Endless Numbered Days. ""*One will spread our ashes ‘round the yard."" It wasn’t always easy to hear that kind of clear-eyed sentiment, so it couldn’t have been easy to deliver it night after night after night. Beam’s first forays away from that kind of minimalist folk and its treacherous intimacy were promising, with the Woman King EP and his mini-album with Calexico leading right up to The Shepherd’s Dog in 2007, still a career high. If subsequent albums have sounded less inventive and immediate, the reason wasn’t so much the widescreen arrangements, the experiments with psychedelic jazz and free rock, or even the full band Beam took into the studio and out on the road. Instead, it was a new tack in songwriting, which found him experimenting with fleeting impressionism over concrete details. Each new record put more and more space between Beam and the listener; his songs began to sound affected and oddly distant, as though he were filming a movie whose action took place entirely in the middle distance. Coming at the end of that ho-hum run of albums, this new rarities catch-all Archive Series Volume No. 1 arrives like a breath of fresh air. Beam is currently between labels, with a few rumored collaborative projects (a duets record with Jesca Hoop, a covers album with Ben Bridwell) overshadowing any talk of his next studio album. While it certainly doesn’t constitute a do-over, it does gently recall a time when he was just beginning to form a strong connection with his listeners and when he could take that indie folk sound in any direction imaginable. Tucked under the bed or squirreled away in the guest bedroom closet, these songs become a point from which to measure his decade-long career, to see how far he has come since he made those first home recordings. It’s bracing to hear him in this familiar setting once again, to hear the roomy ambience of opener ""Slow Black River"", a song strong enough to hold its own against anything on The Creek Drank the Cradle. But it’s also a good reminder of just how intricate his minimalist folk arrangements could be. Most of these songs feature just voice and guitar, yet there is a lot going on. There’s a physicality to Beam’s guitar playing, which makes even the slower tunes sound both urgent and casual. The lo-fi production erases any sense of depth in the production, which might be a problem for many artists but here it means that every instrument and every sound is on the same plane—a small wall of sound. Beam’s strums can be percussive and quietly emphatic, highlighting the breeziness of the melody on ""The Wind Is Low"" and evoking a sinister force driving ""Minor Piano Keys"". When he adds instruments—a bass on ""Judgement"" [sic] or the slide guitar on ""Loretta"" or what sounds like a mandolin on ""Wade Across the Water""—it’s restrained and specific, like a soundtrack composer insinuating emotions onscreen. On the lo-fi ""Quarters in a Pocket"" a rambunctious banjo conjures a contentment tinged with sadness: ""Time spent with you feels like charcoal sketches for a painting that you won’t let me see,"" he sings over the spiky picking and plucking. ""But I’ve come to find that comfort comes like quarters in a pocket, discovered accidentally."" Much like 2009’s Around the Well, the 2xCD retrospective that acted as an epilogue to his Sub Pop tenure and provides a template for Volume No. 1, the songs on here are surprisingly strong, such that any of them could have appeared on a proper album at any point in Beam’s decade-plus career. But the collection never sounds like the sum of its parts. That may be due to the absence of the kind of overarching idea that animates his studio albums, or with the fact that at 16 tracks Volume No. 1 is simply too generous. That’s the nature of any kind of vault-clearing compilation: Instead of a simple snapshot of a period in his career, Beam has created something more like a charcoal sketch. Hopefully, more volumes will soon follow.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20199-archive-series-volume-no-1/,Black Cricket,2015.0,"Iron & Wine's Archive Series Volume No. 1: Folk/Country Brilliance at its Best

Some of the best music can be found in the archives, away from the commercial pressures and distractions that dominate the current music scene. Iron & Wine's Archive Series Volume No. 1 is a testament to this statement. The album, released in 2015 with a rating of 7.2 out of 10, showcases the band's folk and country roots through an intimate collection of previously unreleased tracks.

Sam Beam, the man behind Iron & Wine, began his career as a professor in film and cinematography before emerging as a musician in 2002. His debut album, The Creek Drank the Cradle, earned him critical acclaim in the folk scene and catapulted him into the limelight. Since then, his unique sound, characterized by his distinctive voice and intricate guitar work, has garnered him a dedicated following.

Archive Series Volume No. 1 is a compilation of Beam's earlier work, recorded in the late 1990s, before his musical career took off. The album opens with ""Slow Black River,"" a hauntingly beautiful track that sets the tone for the rest of the album. The song's minimalist approach and Beam's emotive vocals make for an evocative listening experience, making it one of the standout tracks of the album.

Throughout the album, Beam's lyrics are introspective and contemplative, touching on themes of love, loss, and the passage of time. ""The Wind is Low"" is a somber ballad with a poignant melody that explores the pain of heartbreak, while ""Two Hungry Blackbirds"" showcases Beam's guitar skills with its intricate fingerpicking and upbeat rhythm.

Personal favorite ""Everyone's Summer of '95"" is a nostalgic masterpiece that transports you back to a simpler time, with Beam painting vivid pictures of summer days spent listening to music and drinking beer. It's a song that's both melancholic and uplifting, the perfect balance of emotions that's hard to find in music today.

Iron & Wine's Archive Series Volume No. 1 is a brilliant testament to the band's folk and country roots, showcasing Sam Beam's talent as a musician and songwriter. The album is an intimate collection of previously unreleased tracks that is both hauntingly beautiful and evocative. If you're a fan of folk or country, you need to listen to this album.

"My Morning Jacket, Songs: Ohia",Split EP,Rock,8.5,April 2 2002,Jason Nickey,,"Split EPs. What's the point? Not eclectic enough to be enjoyed as a sampler, too confining to be much of an extended statement, and too long to highlight the strength of a single song like a seven-inch could, they tend to come off like pathetic time-stalling ploys between albums or repositories for second-rate (or worse) material. But, as with all things, there are exceptions. And this, my friends, is a big one. Within the realm of country-leaning indie rock, one will be hard pressed to find three better songs from My Morning Jacket than the three they lead this record off with. And the lone Songs: Ohia track, though more of a completist affair typical to these kinds of releases, is nothing to scoff at, either. What My Morning Jacket confronts us with here is a band on top of its game. Though any discussion of these guys will almost assuredly bring up their sounding like somewhere been Neil Young and the Flaming Lips, the whole truth is they sound like a lot of classic bands and artists-- ranging from the Allman Brothers to Television-- but in the final summation, they sound like no one but themselves. ""O Is the One That Is Real"" is the kind of song a well-wishing fan would hope they'd release as a college radio single from an album, instead of on a split EP that'll likely be overlooked at the end of the day. It's a song that positively could break the band to a wider audience, easily bettering anything the band has recorded so far. It has the mark of a classic stamped all over it: a catchy but slippery guitar riff, slightly anthemic lyrics, and powerful, confident delivery. An attention-grabbing snare crack kicks off the song before singer/guitarist Jim James wails, in his reverb-drenched, honey-n'-whiskey-soaked voice, ""Always leave your television on/ Always keep your answers by the phone..."" By the time the song's reached its peak, with James singing his guts out, ""The radio will play"" over and over again, you find yourself un-self-consciously singing along, and maybe even dusting off the old air guitar. In one fell swoop, it eliminates years of indie rock indoctrination forbidding all non-ironic displays of enjoyment and identification. And it's a beautiful and liberating thing. ""How Do You Know"" is a quasi-ballad with amazing if perplexing lyrics that manage to be evocative despite themselves: ""Who fanned the fire that burned down the lake? One, two, three, four things I'd rather forget."" The songs builds in a similar fashion to the first, with a great dual guitar solo and a classic-rockish drum fill bridge that comes off as completely necessary. ""Come Closer"" is a full-on ballad with no apologies, and though it may sound more like a Neil Young song than anything of My Morning Jacket's previous work, they pull it off like Crazy Horse-- I can say with a fair amount of confidence that it would have made a great b-side for ""Heart of Gold,"" had that space not already been occupied by ""Sugar Mountain."" The subject is love and longing (what else?), and James has never sounded more genuinely forlorn. And that's no small statement for a man who once sung, ""When dark touches your skull, you can dump that on me."" After a 2\xBD-minute palette-cleansing track which sounds like the first three songs sped up and reversed, Songs: Ohia evens out the EP with a 10-minute version of ""Be Your Own Guide,"" a song that appeared as an untitled track in a vastly different form on last year's live album, Me Sei Apparso Come Un Fantasma. A sparse, acoustic jam session captured to tape by Paul Oldham at his studio in Shelbyville, Kentucky, it's notable for featuring his brother, the Bonnie Prince himself, and Appendix Out's Ali Roberts. But, before you wet yourself, it should be noted that Will Oldham's backup vocals are mixed low in the background (we're talking the next room here) and his words are few and far between. Even so, his voice is unmistakable, even at a distance, and his harmonizing with Ohia frontman Jason Molina on the Emersonian title/refrain is stark and moving. It may not be the dream match-up fans have envisioned since Songs: Ohia released its first single on Palace records so long ago, but it is far more affecting than you might expect. And so, what we end up with is a split EP of another breed-- one on which actual talent meets top-shelf songwriting, rather than the usual we-found-this-one-in-the-closet contributions. Showcasing both bands at what is, thus far, their artistic apexes, the record is well worth its $7.49 sticker price. And that's a hell of a lot more than you could say for Rancid and NOFX's BYO Split Series, Vol. III.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5530-split-ep/,Jade Tree,2002.0,"When two legendary rock bands join forces, it's hard not to get excited. That's exactly what happened when My Morning Jacket and Songs: Ohia teamed up to deliver their epic Split EP. This musical gem is a beautiful blend of two worlds, stunning vocals, and powerful instrumentals that will take you on a journey.

Let's start with a brief history of the two bands. My Morning Jacket, hailing from Kentucky, has been around since 1998, and their sound can only be described as one-of-a-kind. With a mix of rock and country vibes, they've developed a loyal fanbase for their unique style. Songs: Ohia, on the other hand, was a project headed by the talented Jason Molina, who sadly passed away in 2013. Their sound was more focused on folk and indie rock, but their impact on the genre is evident in Split EP.

As for the creation story of Split EP, it's a tale of two bands coming together and sharing their passion for music. The original idea came from My Morning Jacket members Jim James and Patrick Hallahan, who invited Molina to record with them in their studio. The collaboration wasn't without its challenges, as the bands had different approaches to music. However, in the end, they came together to create a record that's both authentic and captivating.

The first track, ""Just Because I Do"", is a beautiful slow burn that starts with Molina's whispery vocals and builds up to a powerful chorus. It's a perfect introduction to the EP, and it showcases the strengths of both bands. ""I Will Be There When You Die"" is a standout track that starts with a haunting acoustic guitar and leads to an explosive chorus, while ""Evelyn Is Not Real"" is a dreamy track that's both melancholic and uplifting.

My personal favorite track on the album is ""Our World Is Grey"", which features James and Molina's vocals intertwining perfectly. The track starts slow and builds up to an explosive chorus that will send chills down your spine. The final track, ""Translation"", is a fitting end to the EP, with James and Molina's vocals singing in unison, and the instrumentation perfectly complementing the emotional vocals.

Overall, Split EP is a must-listen for any rock fan. It's a record that showcases the strengths of both bands, and it's a testament to the power of collaboration. The vocals are powerful, the instrumentation is excellent, and the lyrics are thought-provoking. It's a perfect example of what happens when two talented bands come together to create something special.

Various Artists,Endless Highway: The Music of the Band,,5.0,February 2 2007,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"Canadian rompers the Band have managed to eschew broad rock'n'roll canonization: They're rarely mentioned in the same breath as the holy triumvirate (Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, the Who), even though they've directly influenced scads of contemporary artists, and starred in one of the finest concert films of all time, 1978's Martin Scorsese-helmed The Last Waltz. Somehow, the Band continue to be most gossiped-about for their pivotal role in Bob Dylan's famed acoustic-electric trajectory: In 1967, Dylan invited his touring band (then nameless, but occasionally going by the Hawks or the Crackers or the Honkies) to record a series of demos in the basement of a house in Woodstock, New York. The resulting double LP, which wasn't officially released until 1975, was dubbed ""the greatest album in the history of popular American music"" by The New York Times, inspired a full-length book by Greil Marcus, and fed perfectly into Dylan's ever-aggrandizing mythology. Despite loads of critical acclaim for their solo debut, 1968's excellent Music From Big Pink, The Band never quite wiggled out from Dylan's considerable shadow, or transcended the legendary intrigue of The Basement Tapes. Endless Highway: The Music of the Band attempts to rectify the Band's little-brother standing, recruiting artists like the Allman Brothers, My Morning Jacket, Death Cab for Cutie, Roseanne Cash, and Lee Ann Womack to celebrate the Band's discography, on the 30th anniversary of the filming of The Last Waltz. It's hard to think of a single tribute album that's endured as more than a novelty, or functioned as anything more than a chance for a handful of contemporary artists to pay drooling homage to a musical hero, and, unfortunately, Endless Highway is no different. The record opens with Guster (including, weirdly, Ray LaMontagne on harmonica) performing ""This Wheel's on Fire"", a track co-written by Dylan with bassist/guitarist Rick Danko. Despite some appropriately-jangly banjo strums, Guster's rendition is dopey and forgettable; Bruce Hornsby's slick, smarmy take on ""King Harvest"" is no more forgivable (to make things worse, Hornsby sounds like he's doing some kind of perverse Dave Matthews vocal impression). Gomez's skronky swipe at ""Up on Cripple Creek"" banks on preserving the hustle of the original; Jack Johnson's spare ""I Shall Be Released"" is stoic, if otherwise uninspired. There are a handful of compelling contributions: My Morning Jacket's ""It Makes No Difference"" (which was recorded, appropriately, at Levon Helm's studio in Woodstock) feels organic and raw, riddled with perfect guitar wankery and Jim James' otherworldly yowls. The Allman Brothers' live cover of ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" feels custom-made for their set; the Band has precious few actual ties to the American south (although Helm was born in Arkansas), and, unsurprisingly, the Allmans' Georgia wails suit the song-- which details the fall of Richmond to the Union Army-- preposterously well. Ben Gibbard's habit of cooing about arcane American spaces makes ""Rockin' Chair"" an oddly successful fit for Death Cab for Cutie, and their closing rendition is sweet and loose. But ultimately, even though Endless Highway is a noble effort, nothing here truly showcases the Band's songwriting any better than the Band itself, and the artists involved could do better work by just imploring their fans to pick up The Band or Music From Big Pink.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9852-endless-highway-the-music-of-the-band/,429,2007.0,"If you're a fan of The Band, then you're in for a treat with ""Endless Highway: The Music of the Band"", a tribute album featuring various artists covering some of the band's greatest hits.

First things first, let's talk about The Band. For those who aren't familiar, The Band was a Canadian-American group formed in 1967. They made their mark in the late 60s and early 70s with their unique blend of folk, rock, blues, and country, earning them a dedicated fan base and critical acclaim. Their music was characterized by thoughtful lyrics, impeccable musicianship, and a blend of harmonies that created an organic and indescribable sound.

""Endless Highway: The Music of the Band"" brings together a group of talented musicians to pay homage to The Band's legacy. The album features 12 tracks, each with its own unique take on a classic Band song. From the opening track, a heartfelt rendition of ""Tears of Rage"" by Shawn Colvin, you know you're in for a nostalgic ride.

But this is not just a tribute album, it's a celebration of The Band's legacy. According to the album's liner notes, the producers wanted to create something that would pay tribute to The Band's music, but also offer a fresh interpretation for a new generation of listeners.

And that's exactly what they've accomplished. Songs like ""The Weight"" and ""Up on Cripple Creek"" are reimagined with a modern twist, but still manage to retain the essence of the originals. Perhaps the strongest track on the album is ""Acadian Driftwood"" performed by The Roches. The harmonies are spot on, and the instrumentation captures the essence of The Band's unique sound.

As a fan of The Band, I went into this album with some trepidation. I mean, how could anyone do justice to songs that have become classics in their own right? But I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. While some tracks may not be as strong as others, overall, ""Endless Highway: The Music of the Band"" does justice to The Band's music and legacy.

In terms of the genre, this album is definitely more on the folk side of things, which may not appeal to everyone. As a result, I would give this album a rating of 5.0 out of 10. However, for fans of The Band or for those looking for a fresh take on some classic songs, ""Endless Highway"" is definitely worth a listen.","1.

Edith Frost,Love is Real EP,"Folk/Country,Pop/R&B",7.7,July 13 1999,Ryan Schreiber,Founder,"""Love is real/ Real is love/ Love is asking/ To be loved."" No, this is not a cover of John Lennon's 1971 (Johnson & Johnson lotion ad) classic. And it's a good thing, because while Frost would do an excellent cover of that Plastic Ono Band gem, her song is much more refreshing. Last year's Telescopic only further proved Frost as one of the greatest female songwriters of the decade. Songs like the album's intense opener, ""Walk On the Fire,"" the beautiful ""Tender Kiss"" and the haunting ""You Belong to No One"" displayed her talent for writing stunningly succinct lyrics and undeniable musical prowess. Frost also has a knack for enlisting the help of Chicago's musical elite for her records. Her full- length debut, Calling Over Time, featured the talents of Gastr Del Sol's Jim O'Rourke and David Grubbs, and Sean O'Hagan of Stereolab and the High Llamas. Telescopic boasted production by Royal Trux's Neil Haggerty and Jennifer Herrema (mysteriously credited as ""Adam and Eve""). Now, on Love is Real, her three- song snack between albums, she's brought along the Sea and Cake's Archer Prewitt, Eleventh Dream Day's Rick Rizzo, and Sam Prekop on cover art. (Let's talk for a second about Prekop's art, by the way. The guy's fuckin' awesome. 'Nuff said.) The title cut off the new EP is Edith Frost at her finest. Her straight- forward and earnest lyrics have only improved since Calling Over Time. She now throws out stunningly succinct lines like ""Wonder what you're doing now/ Listen for your telephone call/ Nothing to talk about/ Make up any reason to stall"" so casually that it seems like her second nature. Frost's vocals have also become increasingly controlled-- she's become capable of delivering lines like ""Is there anything at all to talk about/ My love is real,"" implying incredible yearning while retaining her dignity. Perhaps the most impressive gift Frost has to offer is that she's able to say so much with so few words. ""Between Us"" is a sparse love song about drinking with a fellow musician that serves as a fine example of Frost being melancholy sans- cheese. ""The Last One"" is an unexpected slice of traditional country from Frost who rarely strays far from her folk-pop roots. Accompanied solely by an acoustic guitar, she executes like it's the only genre she's ever known. Musically, the track is on par with more upbeat Gillian Welch numbers, but doesn't seem to connect lyrically. Love is Real should tide us over until her forthcoming album is released, if only because the title track is one of Edith Frost's best works to date. And judging from the sound of this EP, it just gets better from here. The next album's her Plastic Ono Band.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3224-love-is-real-ep/,"Drag City,Drag City",,"If you're a fan of Folk/Country, Pop/R&B music, then Edith Frost's ""Love is Real EP"" might just be the album for you. This collection of songs is a unique blend of genres, with each track showcasing the artist's exceptional talent and range.

The EP kicks off with the title track ""Love is Real,"" a beautifully written song that captures the essence of what love truly means. Edith Frost's vocals are soulful and moving, and the lyrics are relatable and heartfelt. This is a perfect song to listen to when you're feeling down or just need a little bit of a pick-me-up.

While the EP only has six tracks, each song is a standout in its own right. ""Easy to Love"" is a standout, with its smooth poppy vibe and catchy chorus that will have you singing along in no time. ""You've Been Cryin'"" is another standout track with its emotional delivery and powerful chorus that really showcases the artist's vocal range.

What sets this EP apart is the level of detail and care that was put into each song's production. The arrangements are intricate and dynamic, with each instrument blending together to create a harmonious and cohesive sound. This is a testament to the band's experience and musicianship.

While there isn't a lot of information available about the band's history, it's clear that Edith Frost is a seasoned musician who knows her craft inside and out. The EP's creation story is also a bit of a mystery, but it seems that the artist wanted to explore new sounds and genres, and the result is an exceptional collection of songs that will resonate with fans of all kinds.

In my personal experience, ""Love is Real EP"" is an album that I'll definitely be coming back to time and time again. As someone who's always on the lookout for new music, it's refreshing to come across an artist that's doing something a little bit different. The EP delivers on all fronts, with its catchy melodies, powerful vocals, and polished production.

Overall, I'd have to give ""Love is Real EP"" by Edith Frost a solid 7.7 out of 10. While there are a few areas where the album could have been improved, it's clear that this is a band with a lot of talent and potential.

Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats,Mind Control,,6.8,May 14 2013,Andy O'Connor,Contributor,"Do we really have the space for another retro-metal act from the opposite side of the Atlantic? Witchcraft kicked things off with their worship of 70s Pentagram and Black Sabbath's self-titled. Graveyard became the Swedish representatives when Witchcraft wasn't all that hip anymore. Kadavar are leading the German front. The Devil's Blood made “occult rock” the new thing for overly discerning metal listeners to hate. British unit Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats think there's room for one more. Mind Control, their latest, almost makes the case. Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats have clear influences from the heavier side of 1970s rock, but they don't feel like a band from that time. Take 70s Pentagram's core guitar sound, meld it with the foreboding gloom of their 80s work, and you've got an idea of what the Deadbeats are going for. The guitars have a smokey, hypnotic murk to them, slathered over Uncle Acid's snaky vocals. Not that it stops “Evil Love” from being a bouncy romp, or opener “Mt. Abraxis” from dooming out gloriously. They also play up their psych edge more than their contemporaries-- not by being a garage rock band that cranks up the reverb, but through their disorienting production and arrangements. Mind Control take a turn for the mellow on its second half, bringing their psych influences into prominence. “Follow the Leader” is the most subdued number here, with marimbas accentuating soft feedback, while “Devil's Work”'s heavy, plodding intro builds up into a dark dirge. If modern sludge bands have ruined that idea for you, take comfort in that Uncle Acid vocals really add to the slow banging. Most of the songs on Mind Control are worth a few spins, but nothing on here quite matches “I'll Cut You Down” from Uncle Acid's 2011 album Bloodlust. Ghost mostly succeeds at sex appeal through menace, but with “Cut”, Uncle Acid beat the ghouls at their own game. The venomous declaration, “I was born a wicked man, no hopes or dreams/ I get my kicks from torturing and screams/ I lust for women's blood, and their evil ways/ I twist my words to what the good book says” becomes even more sinister with the song's foot-stomping, head-bobbing power. “Poison Apple”, released as a single in March, comes the closest to besting “Cut”. Bloodlust was about murder, frenzy, and ids running wild, while Control is about seductive coercion. Not exactly subtle, but most heavy music isn't and probably shouldn't be. It makes sense not from just a lyrical standpoint but also musically, as Bloodlust had a harder sound to compliment those lyrics. “Valley of the Dolls” is where Control loses its ability to truly stand above, dragging on with no real purpose. It's the only bad song on the whole record, but even just one lapse can throw off the vibe. Control almost shows real signs of vitality in a necrophillic genre. Still, Black Sabbath tickets start at 70 bucks and Bobby Liebling, though doing better, is still pushing it in years. If Control gets Uncle Acid on tour and into the psyches of more listeners, we can put those “Dolls” in the closet.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18059-uncle-acid-and-the-deadbeats-mind-control/,Rise Above,2013.0,"If you're looking for a band that embodies the spirit of classic rock, then Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats are the band for you. Their latest album, ""Mind Control"", is a thrilling and captivating experience that will take you on a journey through the depths of psychedelic rock.

For those who are not familiar with Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats, they are an English rock band that was formed in 2009. The band is known for its heavy guitar riffs, trippy lyrics, and horror-themed imagery. ""Mind Control"" is their second studio album and was released in 2013.

What sets ""Mind Control"" apart from other albums is its creation story. The band's leader and chief songwriter, Kevin Starrs (who performs under the moniker Uncle Acid) has said that the album was inspired by the darker side of 1960s culture, particularly the Manson Family and their infamous murders.

The album begins with the haunting track ""Mt. Abraxas"", which sets the tone for the rest of the album. The song is driven by a thunderous drumbeat and distorted guitar riffs. The vocals are eerie and foreboding, drawing the listener in and preparing them for what lies ahead.

From there, the album takes the listener on a journey through a variety of musical styles. ""Mind Crawler"" is a pounding rock track that pulsates with energy, while ""Poison Apple"" is a slower, brooding number that showcases Uncle Acid's skill in creating a mood with his music.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Evil Love"". The song starts off with a slow, jangly guitar riff that builds into a wall of sound. The vocals are distorted and echoey, with the lyrics telling the story of a doomed love affair that will lead to destruction.

Another standout track is ""Death Valley Blues"". The song is built around a bluesy guitar riff that is both melancholic and uplifting at the same time. The lyrics are sparse, but paint a vivid picture of a desolate landscape where anything could happen.

Overall, I found ""Mind Control"" to be an intriguing and captivating album. Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats are masters of creating a mood with their music, and this album is a perfect example of that. While the subject matter may be dark and disturbing, the music itself is undeniably catchy and enjoyable.

If you're a fan of classic rock, then ""Mind Control"" is an album that you need to hear. It may not be for everyone, but if you're willing to take a trip through the dark side of rock, then this album is definitely for you. Give it a listen and let your mind be controlled by the sounds of Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats.","1. Review A includes comparisons to other similar bands, while Review B does not.

Marcos Cabral,False Memories,,6.5,August 30 2013,Andy Beta,Contributor,"In 2008, the UK label REKIDS released a single from an underground Brooklyn production duo Runaway, comprised of Jacques Renault and Marcos Cabral, which was subsequently snatched up and released stateside by the DFA. “Brooklyn Club Jam” was precisely that, a track buoyed by an echoey piano line that built into a track and felt right at home amid house, disco, and electro without being beholden to any one genre. It also felt like one of the first well-beneath-the-radar “Made in Brooklyn” tracks to travel far outside of the borough to other cities. For those listening close, it suggested that something was brewing beyond the island of Manhattan. And while his Runaway counterpart Jacques Renault has gone on to throw the popular “Let’s Play House” party and release records on an imprint of the same name, Cabral has kept a relatively low profile. Yet it was his 24 Hour Flight EP on the nascent Long Island Electrical Systems (L.I.E.S.) that began to turn heads, both to Cabral and to the label that released it. And for good reason: the extremely limited release showed Cabral to be a master craftsman at making hypnotic and deep three o’clock in the morning style tracks. So it makes a certain amount of sense that L.I.E.S.’s inaugural full-length artist release would also come from Cabral, marking his first album with False Memories. But as its title suggests, things are not quite as they appear, as instead of offering up a selection of tracks that might complement the sounds to be found on 24 Hour Flight and subsequent releases, False Memories instead digs into Cabral’s personal cassette tape archive. As the press sheet for the album notes, the album’s 14 tracks stem from Cabral’s initial forays into recording, done while living in upstate New York. “I knew nothing about ‘making’ music at this time and was using this fairly primitive wav-looping program called Acid,” Cabral wrote, using a 303 and his computer to make loops. The result offers a very rough, primitive portrait of the producer, which hews close to the L.I.E.S. aesthetic but not always to Cabral’s strengths. Opener “Downhill” is murky and throbbing but while its metallic stabs shine through, not much else happens on the track. The kinetic three-minute “Homemade Muffler” suggests the junkyard playfulness of Eric Copeland's recent Joke in the Hole. There’s an almost cartoonish scampering sound running head on into a 303’s kick, which sends noisy curlicues shooting off in every direction. The tiny squelches and cricket-sized noises of “North Carolina” remind me at times of the obtuse releases of Lithops, the solo guise of Mouse on Mars’ Jan St. Werner. But where those tracks fidget, Cabral is cautious, feeling his way through the track. “Unusually Early” mixes pulses, snare hits, and another drum sound flanged to the extreme, with no other melodic element, to where its three minutes seem to last a lifetime. “Repaired Clocks” has a stronger beat but still feels incomplete, missing the sound of Cabral’s chords that would emerge on later productions. Loping and lo-fi as “Virginia” is, it has a lightness not to be found elsewhere courtesy of a metallic snare sound stretched like taffy. “Broken Clocks” is the grittiest and most distorted track on here, as if transmitted through heavy static. False Memories is true its intent of documenting the sound of experimentation at its most unlearned by a producer who has an excellent touch for his productions in the present moment. Unfortunately, here ""experimenting"" mostly means letting the tape run as one plays with pitch and gain, or else cloaking everything in delay, or else turning the filter knob every which direction. For the first long look at Cabral for most outside of L.I.E.S. devotees, it’s unlikely to make a lasting impression.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18310-marcos-cabral-false-memories/,L.I.E.S.,2013.0,"Have you ever stumbled upon an album that manages to take you on a delicate journey of sound and emotion?

David Yow,Tonight You Look Like a Spider,"Experimental,Rock",6.5,July 19 2013,Nick Neyland,Contributor,"Releasing an album that comes with a concrete monolith is one way to grab peoples' attention. But for David Yow, on solo duties for the first time after years spent baiting audiences as the frontman of Scratch Acid and the Jesus Lizard, it's a minor footnote to a wildly unpredictable record. To say it's uncompromising would be correct, although somewhat redundant, as he hasn't ever dealt in half measures. But this is not the sound of a sweat-soaked Yow plunging into a crowd and rubbing his blubbery belly all over the faces in the front row; Instead, it's a studio creation, cut somewhere between the art-fun antics of the Residents, old horror movie soundtracks, classical leanings, a streak of digital noise, a burst of Spanish guitar, text messages translated by computer software, and a recording of Yow squeezing a cat. Tonight You Look Like a Spider is an album that has been 15 years in the making, once destined to be released by Mike Patton's Ipecac, but ultimately coming out on the Joyful Noise label. Naturally, Yow's new home have heralded its release with a photo of him with jeans around his ankles, posed in front of a toilet. The picture hovers over a blurb that offers insights such as: ""I named it Tonight You Look Like a Spider after a spider I saw one night."" Don't look to Yow for any easy explanations for this stuff, but it's better that way, just left hanging out there for people to determine their own interpretation. It's mostly instrumental, alternately brilliant and terrible, sometimes focused, at other times hopelessly rambling. Yow would probably admit as much himself. ""The record is kind of retarded in a lot of ways,"" he said in a recent podcast by Vish Khanna. On cursory listens there might not appear to be much that ties this work to Yow's former persona as a drooling, babbling rock beast, but it's pulled from a similar sensibility. He admits to having no formal musical training or even knowing how chords work-- essentially, this is an album that's as psychotic as his live shows with the Jesus Lizard, both of which hinge on the premise that the less you know, the more demented you can get. Part of Yow's success as a vocalist and performer was because there was really no one like him; similarly, this album works best when he's fully committed to making a creation without peer. Its failings come when he edges toward the familiar, at times resembling a dollar store Scott Walker, stuck with MIDI presets in a rotting basement instead of large orchestras in an expansive studio. For someone who worked so well with concision in his other bands, it's a surprise to find out that Yow works best over great lengths of time in his solo guise. The two 10-minute-plus tracks are the best pieces here, one heading off on a million tangents (""Opening Suite""), the other closeted in a gradually unfurling drone that resembles a slowed-down air raid siren (""Visualize This""). The rest feels like a mixture of Yow amusing himself, sometimes hitting on a strain of inspiration, but just as often tailing off into inconsequential meanderings when the ideas run dry. At its most playful it feels like an army of ringing alarm clocks pounding on your head (""Uncle""), or mirrors the kind of pithy spoken word rants Ann Magnuson would undertake in Bongwater (""Senator Robinson's Speech""). Of course, the track that comes closest to beauty, full of dark piano stabs spun through a spooky ambient fog, is called ""Lawrence of a Labia"". Albums recorded over ample stretches of time often don't hold together well, and Tonight is no exception. Sometimes the sounds are horribly dated-- synth-induced slap bass sounds that border on the ""Seinfeld""-ian, even a hint of Al Jourgensen's industrial emptiness in ""Bleth My Thoul"" (presumably some unspecified private joke Yow is inflicting on his audience). Although one of the strengths of this album is that it's clearly coming straight out of a void, oblivious to anything else around it, there's also a childlike wonder coupled with a decent understanding of the gruesome side of life. Yow's vocal work had that, too. In the times when he wasn't jumping into the audience at Jesus Lizard shows there was something decidedly creepy about him, a feeling of the paunchy uncle with whisky on his breath, cornering you and asking uncomfortable questions. Still, he doesn't quite see it that way. When asked about it on Khanna's podcast, Yow simply responded: ""Am I scary? I’m just ugly.""",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18209-david-yow-tonight-you-look-like-a-spider/,Joyful Noise,2013.0,"David Yow's ""Tonight You Look Like a Spider"" is an experimental rock album that pushes boundaries and challenges the listener's expectations. As a fan of alternative rock and experimental genres, I was excited to dive into this album and explore its complexities.

First, it's worthwhile to understand the band's history. David Yow is best known for his work in The Jesus Lizard, an American underground rock band active in the 90s. With his distinctive singing style and powerful stage presence, Yow left an indelible mark on the rock world. ""Tonight You Look Like a Spider"" is Yow's second solo release since the disbanding of the Jesus Lizard in 1999. This album was created in collaboration with producer Troy Gregory, known for his work with Iggy Pop and Killing Joke.

The album's name and title track, ""Tonight You Look Like a Spider,"" are intriguing and intriguingly cryptic. The lyrics are sparse and repetitive, with Yow's voice rising in intensity over a pounding, driving beat. The track is a mesmerizing opener that sets the tone for the album as a whole.

From there, the album takes the listener on a journey through a wide range of sounds and styles. ""Thee Itch"" offers a more subdued, acoustic sound while ""Uncertain"" culminates in a frenzy of frenetic guitar riffs. ""Mr. Goldblatt"" stands out as a personal favorite with its catchy, upbeat rhythm and memorable lyrics.

As the album progresses, it becomes clear that ""Tonight You Look Like a Spider"" is a deeply personal project for Yow. The songs feel raw and intimate - even the tracks with more traditional rock elements feel stripped down and vulnerable. It's as if Yow is letting his listeners in on a secret, sharing pieces of his inner world through his music.

One of my favorite tracks, ""Dave, Don't Be a Dick,"" feels like a warning from a concerned friend - it's playful, but also pointedly honest. I appreciated the moments where the album took a more humorous turn, breaking up some of the more intense and brooding material.

Overall, ""Tonight You Look Like a Spider"" is a challenging and fascinating album that rewards close listening. While not for the faint of heart, it offers a unique glimpse into the mind of a true rock icon. If you're a fan of experimental rock and are looking for an album that pushes boundaries, this is definitely worth a listen. With a rating of 6.5 out of 10, I'd say it's not for everyone, but worth it for those who appreciate a little edge and creativity.","1.

DOOM,Gazzillion Ear EP,Rap,7.2,January 7 2010,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"After the better part of a year's worth of listening, it's not out of the question to call ""Gazzillion Ear"" the standout track from DOOM's Born Like This. At the very least, it's one of the album's most attention-grabbing cuts. J Dilla's hauntological tour of the 2000s' second half manifested itself here as a fused-together unearthing of two of his archived beats: the organ-driven psych-soul ""Dig It"" and the ""Return of the 'G'""-gone-lo-fi Moroderisms of ""Phantom of the Synths"". DOOM united those two movements with a tour de force rendition of his characteristic hookless, free-associative pop-culture cliché-disemboweling that stands up to any of the top three verses on Madvillainy. And even through the rawness, he rode on that beat so securely that even without the Dilla shoutouts it'd be a fool's errand to separate his voice from it. Not that Thom Yorke or Dave Sitek or Jneiro Jarel are fools, of course-- it's just that they have their work cut out for them when it comes to remixing this song. The Gazzillion Ear EP includes the Yorke remix that accompanied the iTunes release of Born Like This, a collaboration between Sitek and Jarel, and another Jarel mix created under his ""Dr. Who Dat?"" guise. The EP also includes the original track, largely for completion's sake, and a brief, shrugworthy bonus beat entitled ""The.Green.Whore.Net""; it's probably for the best that most people who already own Born Like This (by which I mean pretty much anyone who would already be interested in ""Gazzillion Ear"" in any context) can pick this one up piecemeal. While Yorke's remix doesn't supplant the original, it doesn't bother to try-- in fact, it doesn't even use the same vocal track. DOOM's flow on the Yorke remix is both faster-spitting and more intense, a reserved yet intimidating raspiness on some Clint Eastwood business. It's also split up, giving his lyrics some breathing room, but part of the appeal of ""Gazzillion Ear"" is that DOOM just goes nonstop, so hearing his voice drop out every so often to let Yorke's distantly twitching, wordless-murmur ambience burble for a moment sabotages the momentum. And as much promise as that skittering, icy beat holds, it sounds way too ghostly and mournful to back up a verse featuring namedrops of ""The Gong Show"" and Ernest Goes to Camp. Jarel's two contributions make a lot more sense, since they capture the lyrics' menacing/absurd split personality in their own unique language. Given the advanced age of the Yorke remix, the Jarel/Sitek teamup is the blockbuster draw on this EP, and it doesn't disappoint. They pull a neat trick of turning Dilla's lifted keyboard melodies inside out and echoing it loosely with a burbling sound somewhere between highlife guitars and late-60s analog electronics, throwing in some truncated blasts of halfway-Afrobeat brass that eventually spill out into an invigorating horn outro. But it's Jarel's other contribution that steals the show: the Dr. Who Dat? mix is boom-bap that breathes through deep, thrumming digital bass, riding on zone-out synths and hi-hats that melt and freeze into crystalline sonics. He's done something better than distracting listeners from how great the original version is-- he's provided a good reason to speculate what DOOM might sound like over more beats like this.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13800-gazzillion-ear-ep/,Lex,2010.0,"It’s hard to deny the impact that DOOM has had on the rap game. With a career spanning over two decades, the MC formerly known as MF DOOM has left an indelible mark on the genre, inspiring a multitude of artists who have followed in his footsteps. And now, with his 2010 release ""Gazzillion Ear EP,"" the underground legend proves that he still has plenty of gas left in the tank.

For those unfamiliar with DOOM’s work, ""Gazzillion Ear EP"" is a great place to start. The album is a concise showcase of DOOM’s unique style, which combines off-kilter rhyme patterns with obscure pop culture references and surrealistic imagery. Even if you don’t understand every line, it’s impossible not to be drawn in by DOOM’s hypnotic flow and the mesmerizing beats that back him up.

The album opens with the title track, a mesmerizing cut that sees DOOM spitting over a pulsating beat that sounds like it was lifted straight out of a horror film. It’s a perfect introduction to the world of DOOM, setting the stage for the rest of the album’s weird and wild offerings.

Another standout track is ""Absolutely,"" which finds DOOM teaming up with the late, great J Dilla on production duties. The beat is a dazzling display of Dilla’s trademark chops, with stuttering drums and hypnotic samples interweaving in a way that only he could pull off. DOOM rises to the occasion with some of his most acrobatic rhymes to date, proving that even after all these years, he’s still one of the most versatile MCs in the game.

Elsewhere on the album, DOOM shows off his edgier side on tracks like ""Ballskin,"" a grimy, bass-heavy banger that sees the MC getting in touch with his inner villain. There’s also ""Rap Ambush,"" a posse cut that features DOOM trading verses with up-and-comers like Kurious and A.G., proving that even as he’s aged, DOOM is still able to keep up with the young bucks.

One thing that’s worth noting is that ""Gazzillion Ear EP"" is a relatively short release, clocking in at just under 20 minutes. While some listeners might be left wanting more, others might appreciate the album’s brevity. For me, it’s the perfect length – long enough to showcase DOOM’s range, but short enough to leave me wanting more.

All in all, ""Gazzillion Ear EP"" is a great addition to DOOM’s already-illustrious discography. Whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer to his work, there’s plenty to appreciate here. With its surrealistic imagery, esoteric references, and hypnotic beats, this album is a must-listen for anyone who appreciates rap as a form of high art.","1.

Trippie Redd,Life’s a Trip,Rap,6.2,August 15 2018,Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,"A year ago, Trippie Redd stood in the iconic Coney Island theme park  staring at the screaming roller coaster riders and berating the crowd for faintly booing his performance. Besides a few Supreme shoulder-bag wearing SoundCloud heads, the audience had no clue who he was despite his track “Love Scars” tearing up the internet. He said that they will know him in a month—and he was right. Even in the hyperspeed world of SoundCloud, Trippie’s rise was accelerated. It’s why his debut album Life’s a Trip shouldn’t be disappointing but is because despite the numbers, high-profile beefs, a permanent spot on DJ Akademiks’ Instagram, and a voice like no other, Trippie wasn’t ready for his big moment. Trippie’s debut mixtape, 2017’s A Love Letter to You, was a beautiful mess. The tape created a world where Trippie sang, introduced everyone to his signature moans and screeches, and even dove into some boom-bap. He was versatile, he could hold a melody well enough to perform a pop-punk ballad and rap like someone who listened to too much Little Brother. And that was cool, but what made Trippie a breakout star were the times when he took full control of his voice and embraced the incessant shrieking on production that was both dark and airy. On Life’s a Trip, Trippie—who begins his album 10 feet from the mic yelling, “I’m a rockstar,”—fights his own strengths. One thing the artists born on Soundcloud who seamlessly transitioned into rap stars have done is emphasize their sound, even if it was initially polarizing. Lil Pump doubled down on the minute-and-a-half speaker-blaring ad-lib marathons and Playboi Carti transformed his ethereal sound into a lush vibe. Trippie doesn’t seem as sure of himself and the weight of a debut album leads to some head-scratching decisions. At his best, Trippie’s music is slightly maniacal and haunting, but still catchy and relaxed enough to have pop appeal. Life’s a Trip hardly ever reciprocates that feeling; instead, Trippie falls into the misconception that melancholy guitars are the best way to convey something serious. The intro track, “Together,” is a slow-moving ballad that restricts his voice while he halfheartedly sings about confronting his inner demons. “How You Feel” incorporates Chris Daughtry-esque strumming that ruins the moment when his voice reaches its pop-punk peak. Trippie then wallows in despair on “Underwater Flyzone” a six-minute downbeat moan-fest absent of drums, and by this point, you’d rather read a timeline of his beef with 6ix9ine than hear another guitar. But where Trippie really goes wrong is the blatant hit-chasing, which feels unnecessary given the strength of his music until now. He ignores the blueprint laid out by songs like “Gucci Gang” and “XO Tour Lif3,”—which took significant elements of each of those artists and turned it up a notch—and on “Taking a Walk,” he desperately reaches to meme hell for a bright sounding Scott Storch revival that hardly maintains any of Trippie’s previous identity. He saves the song with some cleverness (“Ooh, so they think I wanna die, yeah/Cause my doors are suicide, yeah”) but it still sounds so forced. He then gives the Diplo-produced “Wish” its second album placement—after blaming Diplo for ruining it on his own album—and gets in touch with his rockstar dreams, stepping into his voice: “Might just blow my brain, I’d be Kurt Cobain.” But all of Diplo’s additions to the track are so irritatingly unaware of Trippie’s appeal mashing his voice with an unsubtle harmonica and using these flat drums that sound like they were programmed before Trippie was even born. When Trippie strays away from the guitars and hit-chasing, we get to see glimpses of his potential. Atlanta hit-maker Honorable C. N.O.T.E. blesses Trippie with a beat that mixes a dark melody with 2010 Lex Luger on the Travis Scott-assisted “Dark Knight Dummo.” It’s also one of the few instances where Trippie lets his voice run wild, even belting on the ad-libs. Producer OZ sets Trippie up with hard-hitters on both “Bang” and “Uka Uka,” two songs that pace his vocal explosions perfectly. And Young Thug rolls through on “Forever Ever” to briefly steal the show and pass the polarizing songbird baton to Trippie. Life’s a Trip is stuffed with forced production choices that impair Trippie’s over-the-top voice from hitting all of its quirks. It’s clear Trippie needs more time to develop his sound and iron out a direction that doesn’t feel like a detour. A great Trippie Redd album is possible, but first he needs to destroy all of the guitars in his vicinity, block Diplo’s cell, and use his voice and Soundcloud rooted style that got him here in the first place.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/trippie-redd-lifes-a-trip/,10K Projects,2018.0,"If there's one thing that can be said for Trippie Redd's latest album, ""Life's a Trip,"" it's that the rapper definitely knows how to craft a catchy hook. From the opening track ""Together"" to the album's centerpiece ""Taking a Walk,"" Trippie Redd effortlessly delivers memorable verses and choruses that get lodged in your head like a catchy tune you just can't shake.

Now, I have to admit that I wasn't originally a big fan of Trippie Redd's music. But the more I listened to ""Life's a Trip,"" the more I found myself getting hooked on his unique blend of rap, rock, and emo. It's a sound that doesn't always work, but Trippie Redd has found a way to make it his own. And surprisingly, it works pretty damn well.

One of the things that stood out to me on this album was the thematic cohesion. Like the album's title suggests, ""Life's a Trip"" is a journey that takes the listener through highs and lows, love and heartbreak, and all the ups and downs that come with being alive. It's not exactly groundbreaking subject matter, but Trippie Redd makes it feel fresh in the way only he can.

As for the album's backstory, you can tell that Trippie Redd put a lot of time and effort into crafting these songs. He's a young rapper who's already got a solid catalog under his belt, but ""Life's a Trip"" feels like a culmination of all his past work. The album is the result of a long, arduous journey, and that sense of determination and grit comes through in every track.

But for me, the standout moment on ""Life's a Trip"" comes towards the end with the song ""Dark Knight Dummo."" It's an epic, anthemic track that features fellow rapper Travis Scott, and it's the kind of song that makes you want to pump your fist and shout along to the lyrics.

Overall, I'd say ""Life's a Trip"" is a strong album that showcases Trippie Redd's undeniable talent as a rapper and songwriter. It's not without its flaws, of course - some tracks feel a bit same-y, and the use of autotune can be overdone at times - but for the most part, this is a solid effort from a rising star in the rap game. I'm excited to see where Trippie Redd goes from here.","1. Review A includes more detailed descriptions and critiques of specific songs on the album, while Review B only mentions one standout track.

Magnetic Morning,A.M.,Rock,5.7,January 30 2009,David Raposa,Contributor,"After giving Magnetic Morning's inauspicious debut EP a thorough savaging, this site's Nitsuh Abebe allows for a little bit of optimism near the end of his review, positing that ""maybe they have the makings of a decent album tucked away somewhere."" Given the pedigree of the two more notable names involved-- in case you missed it, former/current Swervedriver Adam Franklin and Interpol backseat steady-at-the-wheel driver Sam Fogarino (now joined by the Album Leaf's Jimmy Lavalle, among others)-- one would hope something good would come from their Wonder Twins powers activating. What's offered on A.M. (just released on CD and LP after being available digitally since last fall), however, is a more elaborate reiteration of what the group, as a duo, presented on its debut. The extra wiggle room gives Magnetic Morning more space to state their case, but it's doubtful anyone's mind will be changed by what's available here. For those who hoped freeing Fogarino from his day job's mid-tempo morass and hooking him up with the guitar hero of 90s Britrock (non-Shields division), will result in volatile, invigorating rock, there's slim pickings. In that vein there's the ""Roadrunner""-checking ""Motorway"" (which features a fair amount of MBVish whammy bar abuse), and the epic fuzzy thud of ""And I Wonder"". The rest of the album takes a more stately and baroque turn. In case you haven't gotten the memo, Franklin uses a measured cover of the Shangri-Las' ""Out in the Streets"" to make it clear-- ""he don't do the wild things that he did before."" At least, he doesn't when he's not out on a reunion tour. This means, instead of more tunes like ""Motorway"", listeners get subdued tracks with extra helpings of clavinet and mellotron (like ""Indian Summer""), songs on which Franklin makes like a slowhanded shoegazer (""At a Crossroads, Passive""), or a trip-hopping track that sounds like an outtake from a second-generation shoegazing conglomerate like Doves (""Come Back""). And it also means Franklin continues to smother his smoky charisma within the mix. More often than fans of his voice might like, he's content to let his guitar do the talking, leaving his voice to murmur sweet nothings in the background as the music glitters and shimmers around him. Thanfully, the album's not a completely dour and listless affair. With Fogarino, the group has a drummer who's at once both laid-back and assertive, someone that can ground and propel these songs without overwhelming or being overwhelmed by what's happening around him. Filling out the group with more players is a definite boon, and there are enough bells and whistles on these tunes to help them stand out from each other and give A.M. some distinguishing textures (something lacking from the group's initial five-song bow). Still, there's that unmistakable ""side project"" air surrounding this record, the sense that this is just an enjoyable way to wile away time during hiatuses in other endeavors. It's enjoyable enough in that regard, but there's enough here (especially when they cut loose) to make me wonder what would happen if this turned from a pleasant distraction into Franklin and Fogarino's main gig.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12617-am/,Friend or Faux,2009.0,"If you're looking for a rock album to add to your collection, Magnetic Morning's A.M. might just be the perfect choice. With a solid score of 5.7 out of 10, this album promises a mix of inspired melodies, powerful guitar riffs, and soulful vocals that are bound to have you nodding along in appreciation.

Magnetic Morning was formed in 2006 by Sam Fogarino (from Interpol) and Adam Franklin (from Swervedriver), so the band has already secured quite a bit of street cred with this much of a provenance. Although the band only released one album before going on hiatus in 2009, they have managed to create quite a buzz with their debut album, A.M.

Recorded in a cabin in upstate New York, A.M. was born out of a desire to escape the hustle and bustle of city life and to focus solely on the music. The result is an album that is raw, gritty, and full of emotion. From the opening track ""Spring Unseen"" to the closing ""Before I Go,"" A.M. is a journey that will leave you feeling uplifted and inspired.

As a rock enthusiast, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed A.M. The album is very cohesive, there is a clear direction to the sound, and the energy builds over time. The guitar riffs are intricate, performed masterfully, and complemented nicely by Fogarino's powerful drumming. Franklin's vocals are also a standout feature, with a unique and expressive range that adds an extra layer of depth to the music.

Tracks like ""At a Crossroads"" and ""The Right Direction"" are two of my favorites, with their upbeat tempos, catchy choruses, and explosive guitar lines. However, the album also includes softer, more introspective tracks such as ""No Direction"" and ""Indian Summer"" that showcase the band's ability to create music that is dynamic and diverse.

In summary, Magnetic Morning's A.M. is a fantastic album for anyone who loves rock music. The band's history and dedication to their craft are evident in every note, making this album a must-listen for anyone who appreciates great music.

Summer Hymns,"Value Series, Vol. 1: Fool's Gold",Rock,5.9,May 21 2004,Sam Ubl,,"There are bands who make music with distinctly seasonal undercurrents, and then there's Summer Hymns. The Athens, GA-based sextet make no effort to mask their climatic intentions: The warm months are their loyal muse, and until now, the band have seemed content to meander the verdant ruralities of the South, producing immersive, atmospheric pop that's humid and hazy like Athens in thickest summer. While never groundbreaking, musical sojourns like those upon which Summer Hymns embark aren't easy to execute, and bear copious rewards when done well. 2000's Voice Brother and Sister and its successor, A Celebratory Arm Gesture, painted glorious, imagistic portraits of a Pan-South in eternal bloom, a fantastical vision that was in some ways better than the real thing for their kindly manipulation of the mind's eye. 2003's Clemency marked a change of direction, ruefully striking towards homogeneous country-rock territory yet managing to avoid clichÃ© with a barrelful of strong melodies. Value Series, Vol. 1: Fool's Gold is a cursory collection of cast-offs from the Clemency sessions, and while still uniquely Summer Hymns, it's obvious why these tracks didn't make the final cut. In fact, if not for the serene beauty and unspoilt homeyness of Zachary Gresham's vocals, many of these tracks would fall completely flat, lacking the instrumental variety that fleshed out the band's erstwhile work. The downtrodden Rhodes piano on opener ""Fear the Law"" feels uncharacteristically cagey for a band traditionally so inviting. ""Capsized"" is more familiar, but not as captivating and well-formed as simplistically impressionistic numbers like ""New Underdressment"". All told, the album displays a band caught in flux between a reliable, formulaic approach to songwriting, and an obvious desire to branch out-- a perilous stage for any group. Fool's Gold's saving grace is Summer Hymns' knack for serving up comfort tunes-- easily palatable, if prosaic, songs with familiar melodies and unobtrusive orchestration. ""It's Just Not Right"", a rudimentary waltz with a cascading piano melody, and ""Pharmon"", a sly, downhome pop track, seem to prove Summer Hymns, even at their worst, incapable of writing a bad song. ""Crazy Baby"" comes close, but even that track is more of an aside than a song in its 1:17 runtime. Interestingly, the album's two strongest numbers are covers, an exercise for which Summer Hymns hadn't previously shown a penchant. George Harrison's ""Behind That Locked Door"" is an ideal song for the group to interpret, and their version is warmly rife with gilt pedal steel and Gresham's understated yet moving vocals. Meanwhile, a rendition of Johnny Watson's ""It Takes Two"" is slightly more upbeat, shirking the kind of cheekiness that less tactful bands might employ. Of course, summer is still the best season, and by evoking the unmolested pulchritude of nature at its finest, Summer Hymns win instant sustainability by dint of their production aesthetic alone. Fool's Gold is appreciable if only for offering a reminder of how thoroughly enjoyable Summer Hymns' previous work is, and how essential songs like ""Mr. Brewer (Cackle, Cackle)"" and ""Something's Going On"" are to the inauguration of any successful Memorial Day Weekend in my seaside neighborhood. Unfortunately, spinning Voice Brother and Sister and relishing the greening cusp of summer is about all Fool's Gold compels me to do. Perhaps the forthcoming second volume will fare better in producing the vibrant portraits of summer to which the bandname alludes. If not, I may just have to settle for the real thing. ",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7566-value-series-vol-1-fools-gold/,Misra,2004.0,"Summer Hymns' latest album 'Value Series, Vol. 1: Fool's Gold' is an interesting addition to their discography. The band has been around for over two decades and has always been experimenting with their sound. With this album, they continue to do so and push their musical boundaries even further.

The album opens with the track 'Tornado Watch,' which starts off slow and then builds up, creating a sense of anticipation. The guitars are distorted and the vocals are raw, which adds depth to the song. As the album continues, we're taken on a journey through various sounds, ranging from the psychedelic 'Pity and Envy' to the hard-hitting 'Bloody Hell' and the mellow 'I Don't Want to Live in the City.'

The album was recorded in a house in Athens, Georgia, which adds a certain element of intimacy to the sound. It's evident that the band spent a lot of time together during the recording process, and that camaraderie is reflected in the music. The album's producer, David Barbe, has done a good job of capturing that raw energy and translating it to the final product.

As someone who loves rock music, I can appreciate the experimentation that Summer Hymns has injected into this album. However, I must say that some tracks miss the mark for me, and the album as a whole doesn't quite come together in the way that I expected it to. While it's clear that the band is talented, I feel that they could benefit from refining their sound a bit more.

Overall, 'Value Series, Vol. 1: Fool's Gold' is an interesting addition to Summer Hymns' discography.

Charmparticles,Sit Down for Staying EP,Rock,7.0,September 9 2004,Nick Sylvester,Contributor,"Guitar-based shoegaze records are tough sells these days. With increasing ease, laptoppers such as M83 and Ulrich Schnauss churn out the lush vibes of permanently influential tri-force My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Slowdive, but always fall short of their vitality. Artists obsess over Kevin Shields' gonzo production ethics but forget his equally impressive ear for melody, and without the cherry-colored hooks, shoegaze is a land of gimmicks: cute but stupid, talking loud and saying nothing. On last year's Dreams Top Rock, Pluramon (aka Marcus Schnitzler, and a favorite of PFM's dean of writers, Mark Richardson) managed a pretty fine balance between traditionally uncompromising shoegaze melodies and potentially distractive recourse to iBook'd trickbags. Mush IDM artist Clue to Kalo debuted quietly but promisingly with Come Here When You Sleepwalk, which boasted similar (though less successful) attempts at offering shoegaze a legitimate second wind. Both acts nailed the hooks and ambience, but Portland-based quartet Charmparticles is one of the few bands looking to recreate the rock energy of early 90s shoegaze. As on their late 2002 debut, The Scenic EP, the band essentially adds nothing new to the genre with their latest Sit Down for Staying EP, but to its credit, quenches its nostalgia with some remarkable melody-driven songs. A mammoth guitar solo that comes at the end of ""A/O"" forms a curious midpoint for the Sit Down for Staying EP. Before the solo, songs like ""Sixty-Four"" and ""Stand Up for Leaving"" stick to midtempo instrumental pleasantries with little bite, as if to keep listeners focused on Pamela Rooney and Adam Wayne's gorgeous vocal melodies. At times, the chord changes are a tad too predictable to handle such bright hooks-- Charmparticles can sound like Coldplay covering The Cocteau Twins covering Coldplay-- but for the most part, there's always a passage like the washed introductory drones of ""A/O"" that keeps these first few songs from eating themselves. After the solo, Charmparticles rush headlong into riff central. The crisp, punchy ""Gas Gauge"" benefits from Sarah FitzGerald's string of bright ninth strums and drummer Nathanael Merrill's last-second two-beat recoil. ""Solvent"" at first seems a little too alt-rock for its own good, but then Charmparticles strike a crunchy, tom-heavy break and a ghostly, single-plucked guitar line whose timbre will surely bear its share of Interpol comparisons. ""Phone and Finder"" and its kind tambourine jangle bring the Sit Down for Staying EP full circle, incorporating the lessons of the album's two ""sides."" It's Charmparticles' hardest and softest song to date, on their most ambitious and least ambitious effort to date.

Their dedication to their craft is evident throughout this EP, which was recorded during a difficult time for the band members. Despite the struggles they faced during the recording process, Charmparticles managed to create an album that is pure magic.

The title 'Sit Down for Staying' suggests that this EP is about confronting difficult emotions and professing your undying commitment to something.

Daniel Martin Moore,In the Cool of the Day,Folk/Country,7.7,January 20 2011,David Bevan,Contributor,"There's a great story and an even better idea behind In the Cool of the Day. Not too long ago, Kentucky-born singer-songwriter Daniel Martin Moore rolled through WXVU Radio in Cincinnati to play a studio session and give an interview. Totally routine. But when Moore sat down at the old Steinway piano they kept in-house, his head and heart went wild. Apparently Moore had been thinking of making a gospel record for sometime, an album comprised of new original material as well as standards he remembered hearing and singing while growing up in Cold Spring. That piano, for whatever reason, brought it all home. Moore did something smart here: Rather than record straight covers of these songs, he tried to arrange and play them impressionistically, as he remembered them and as shaped by his feelings on spirituality now. In addition, he contributed four similarly inspired gospels songs of his own. The result is a very warm, very welcoming entry point for anyone interested in the gospel tradition. Though this album doesn't remain entirely faithful to the original source material's every layer, it does stay true to the feeling behind that music. That's a very special thing. It also sounds fantastic. Moore enlisted the help of several of his friends to bring the project into being, two of which are My Morning Jacket's Jim James on banjo (credited here as Yim Yames) and drummer Daniel Joseph Dorff, who took over at the aforementioned, mystical, nine-foot Steinway that set the project in motion. Everything here sounds as though it was recorded live with minimal overdubs, and though the feel is loose, all these players also sound like they've been playing together for years. Moore has an impossibly soothing voice (former lablemate and tourmate Sam Beam is of a similar feather) and the lighter fare, most of which can be found on the record's first half, can take on a coffee shop/Jack Johnson in Appalachia feel at times. Shuffles like ""In the Garden"" or Moore's take on Jean Ritchie's ""In the Cool of the Day"" are fully reclined and although they've got a great energy, those songs with a bit more shadow stand out the most. And with the exception of the mandolin-and banjo-laced ""Up Above My Head"", the majority of those songs were authored by Moore. One minute opener ""All Ye Tenderhearted"" is a brief acoustic inhale whose beauty is matched again, but only by the piano and hush of Moore's ""O My Soul"". Lyrically he stitches everything up quietly by referencing the titles and themes of other songs found here, the latter's chorus a nod to the same Jean Ritchie track noted above. In that vein, the arrangements here are also uniformly gorgeous. But the conceptual framework is a much harder sell considering the Christian backdrop. Personally, I didn't grow up in a house where faith or religion played much of a role, save for a reason for Mom and Dad to argue at dinner (she's Catholic, he's Methodist). But religious music was never a hot button issue, and at no point does this, Moore's latest, feel like anything other than an honest expression of love. And, to close like a nerd as much as anything else: this isn't a headphones listen. It's music with which to fill a room or, even better, a home.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15021-in-the-cool-of-the-day/,Sub Pop,2011.0,"Have you ever stumbled upon an album and felt like you’ve just hit the jackpot? That’s exactly what happened when I discovered Daniel Martin Moore’s album, ‘In the Cool of the Day’. With its laid-back folk/country vibes, this album is a hidden gem for those who enjoy rootsy music. 

Moore, an indie-folk musician from Kentucky, showcases his raw talent and poignant songwriting skills in this album. He has been compared to the likes of Iron & Wine and Bon Iver, and rightfully so. With ‘In the Cool of the Day’, Moore takes his sound to even greater heights, making it clear that he deserves a spot among the greats in the folk and country genres. 

The album boasts 10 tracks, which are all true to the bluegrass sound. Each song tells a story that is both personal and universal, and is filled with introspective lyrics that will leave you pondering life’s big questions. Moore’s voice is soothing and emotional, and his guitar playing is spot on. 

One of the standout tracks on the album is ‘Lay Down Your Lonesome Burden’. It’s easy to get lost in the melancholic sound of Moore’s voice as he sings lines like “Lay down your lonesome burden, lay it down and rest with me”. It’s hard not to feel a sense of comfort and warmth in those words.

‘In the Cool of the Day’ was recorded in Louisville, KY, and was produced by Joe Chiccarelli, who has worked with artists such as The Shins, My Morning Jacket, and Beck. The album was recorded on analog tape, which adds a sense of nostalgia to the sound. 

Personal experience-wise, this album has been a staple in my music collection for quite some time now. It’s often the first thing I play on lazy Sunday mornings or on long drives. The album has a way of transporting you to a simpler time and place. I’ve often found myself closing my eyes while listening to it, getting lost in the rich soundscapes and poetic lyrics.

Overall, ‘In the Cool of the Day’ by Daniel Martin Moore is an album that’s definitely worth your time. With its heartfelt lyrics, simplistic melodies, and stunning guitar work, it’s no surprise that it’s garnered a rating of 7.7 out of 10. So if you’re a fan of folk/country music, do yourself a favor and give this album a listen. You won’t regret it.","1.

A.A. Bondy,When the Devil's Loose,Rock,6.6,November 5 2009,David Raposa,Contributor,"While A.A. Bondy realizes that acknowledging his tenure as Verbena frontman Scott Bondy could help shift a few units, that doesn't mean his former life is a point of pride. This is how a writer describes Bondy's indie-rock days in the singer/songwriter's Fat Possum bio: ""He told me that he used to go by the name Scott and had played in a Rock'n'Roll group went by the name Verbena. I asked him what that was like and he muttered something about being an infant in a crib full of bats."" Still, for A.A. Bondy to now exist, Scott Bondy had to go through that ill-fated bat-crib phase. And despite the sonic differences and the name change-- the A.A. stands forÂ Auguste Arthur-- there's an obvious through-line to be drawn between then and now. Where the old Bondy took his cues from all sorts of rock'n'roll progenitors (classic and otherwise), the new Bondy cribs notes from the blues and country folks that influenced those rock'n'rollers. And where the old Bondy would sometimes show his hand too blatantly, the new Bondy is playing his cards with greater aplomb and much greater skill. When the Devil's Loose, A.A. Bondy's second album, is evident of this ever-growing skill. But that's not to say there isn't room to grow. In many ways, When's the Devil's Loose is nearly the same as 2007's American Hearts. Bondy's warm and weathered moan is used to good effect, abetted by some down-home instrumentation and a fair helping of flattering reverb, all in the service of songs that do their damnedest to recall a more agrarian time-- coal burning in a train furnace, rivers running free, pines dancing in the moonlight. Loose puts its best foot forward right from the start, with ""Mightiest of Guns"". If any tune on this album deserves to be called ""Dylanesque"" (possibly the most unbearably portentous modifier/ honorarium thrown in Bondy's direction), it's this one, with its plainspoken torrent of elusive yet evocative images-- ""And the shadows go like ghosts across your rope/ Or take the world and burn it in a spoon."" Each verse offers its own portrait of quotidian drama enlivened by Bondy's wracked croon and tasteful strokes of arcing guitar. The rest of the album offers downtrodden pleasures in a similar vein-- see the elegiac ""To the Morning"", or the player-piano balladry of ""On the Moon"". Even when Bondy's band kicks up its heels, as on the relatively ebullient ""I Can See the Pines Are Dancing"", it's doing so through a weary hard-livin' haze. Still, the music never suffers for the song's overall sorrow. Where Loose does suffer, if only slightly, is in its words. Think back on the image of an infant trapped in a crib full of bats-- it's definitely colorful, and reads off-the-cuff, but there's something a little off about it, like it's trying too hard to be colorful and off-the-cuff. The bio's first line, an introduction that could be framed as a not-so-sly jab at folks like yours truly, suggests it's the singer/songwriter himself is sitting at the typewriter: ""I don't know much about music, so I guess that makes me an expert."" Regardless, it's the sense of desperately trying to sell one's self as authentic, rather than simply acting the part, that undercuts what Loose does so well. More often than not, the music and the mood can make any potential lyrical faux pas a non-issue-- ""A Slow Parade"" and the title track falls into pat fire/desire rhyme patterns, but Bondy's voice smooths over those rough edges and sells the tunes' worry and desperation like a carny selling tickets to the egress. And while Bondy's awkward deployment of colloquialisms like ""a-callin'"" and ""a-cryin'"" in ""Oh the Vampyre"" almost steers the tune into True Blood fanfic territory, the succinctness of a line like, ""You know I could drink the world/ And never get my fill,"" rings as true as anything. But talk of ""a Mississippi night"" (on ""The Mercy Wheel"") or ""the cars of silver and gold"" (on ""The Coal Hits the Fire"") comes off like all-hat no-cattle flourishes from someone trying to pull a fast one. They're placeholder phrases that a more experienced and exacting writer would backtrack and replace, yet Bondy uses them to embellish, if not illuminate, his songs. That Bondy shows a fair amount of evidence on Loose of being the sort of exacting writer that could effortlessly avoid these pitfalls makes such missteps all the more disappointing. And that Bondy can still conjure up a collection of evocative and intriguing songs that succeeds despite this only augurs well for his future.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13509-when-the-devils-loose/,Fat Possum,2009.0,"When the Devil's Loose by A.A. Bondy is a stunning work of art that beautifully captures the sound of rock music in a way that is both soulful and haunting. As a listener, I was immediately drawn into the music, and it quickly became clear that Bondy is a master of his craft. 

Before diving into the album, let's first explore the band's history. A.A. Bondy is the stage name of American singer-songwriter Auguste Arthur Bondy. Bondy began his music career as a member of the band Verbena, with whom he released a number of albums in the late 90s and early 2000s. However, it wasn't until Bondy started pursuing a solo career that he truly made a name for himself.

Now, onto the album itself. When the Devil's Loose was released in 2009 and is a beautifully produced album that showcases Bondy's range and versatility as an artist. From the bluesy opener ""Mightiest of Guns"" to the somber ballad ""To the Morning,"" the album is an emotional rollercoaster that takes listeners on a wild ride through Bondy's innermost thoughts and feelings.

The album was produced by Rob Schnapf, who has worked with a number of notable artists over the years, including Beck, Elliott Smith, and The Vines. Schnapf's production is subtle yet effective, with each instrument perfectly balanced to give the songs room to breathe.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""When the Devil's Loose,"" which features hauntingly beautiful guitar work and Bondy's signature vocals that are as soulful as they are raw. The song is a perfect example of Bondy's ability to combine traditional rock elements with more atmospheric elements to create a sound that is uniquely his own.

Another standout track is ""Oh the Vampyre,"" a slow-burning ballad that gradually builds to a powerful climax. The song showcases Bondy's storytelling abilities, with vivid imagery that paints a picture of a world filled with darkness and despair.

Overall, When the Devil's Loose is a fantastic album that showcases A.A. Bondy's range and versatility as an artist. While it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate soulful, heartfelt music that is steeped in the traditions of rock and roll will find a lot to love here. Personally, I found the album to be a deeply moving and emotional experience that stayed with me long after the final notes had faded away. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something that is both beautiful and haunting.","Step 1: Review A includes an anecdote about the artist's past while Review B does not.

Various Artists,Nashville,,5.9,June 25 2002,Alison Fields,,"Tribute albums are a funny business. In a best-of-all-possible-worlds scenario, the tribute album can be mutually beneficial for both artists and the industry. They theoretically allow artists the ability to both honor their influences and appear more musically sophisticated. If you're unable to appear on a tribute album for a highly obscure, yet supposedly seminal Danish psychedelic band, you have to go out of your way to find the most obscure song ever recorded by the recognizable band you're covering. Labels, in the meantime, reap the benefits of audience identification with both the coverer and the coveree. Strictly hypothetical example being: ""People love Tom Petty. People love Incubus. If Incubus also happens to love Tom Petty, we may be able to move some serious units."" Mint Records' recent Nashville tribute targets diehard fans of both Robert Altman and Neko Case. And, just so you know, all twelve of them have already purchased this record and cancelled their Short Cuts screening party to write poison pen letters to me at first sight of that 5.9 (never fear-- I'm a fan of both Robert Altman and Neko Case. I'll be nice, I promise). It's not a particularly intimidating demographic. Nashville is a brilliant film, featuring a superior script and a fairly astonishing ensemble cast. It's one of the best films of the 1970s-- a decade synonymous with great filmmaking-- and I don't think I'd be overstating if I called it a classic of American cinema. In spite of (or perhaps because of) its reputation, I didn't get around to seeing it until just last year; it didn't change my life or anything, but I liked it. So, I can't exactly hold it against you if you haven't rushed out to the local Pic-A-Flic to rent this musical/comedy/satire tour de force about politics and country music. Mint Records' tribute is an almost perfect replica of the movie's soundtrack, with the artists on the album playing the part of the actors singing as their characters from the film. In the filming of Nashville, Altman gave each of the actors the opportunity to write their own songs for the characters they portrayed. On the tribute, Canadian alt.country performer Carolyn Mark doled out the songs to her circle of friends and/or Mint labelmates. On Mint Records' Nashville, the part of sleazy, self-righteous town greeter Henry Haven (originally played and subsequently sung by Henry Gibson) is sung by both Dave Lang (the preachy, hilariously maudlin ""For the Sake of the Children"") and Dave Gowans (the jingoistic bicentennial tune ""200 Years""). Both do a competent job emulating the smarm factor in Gibson's original delivery. Like most of this album, there's not a considerable amount of originality in the Mint artists' versions versus the original. It's not a completely re-envisioned album, it's just Nashville replayed by a bunch of Canadians and a couple New Pornographers (note, however, that New Pornographer Carl Newman's ""Memphis"" is not among the album's high points). Neko Case does a fine job with ""Rolling Stone,"" eclipsing Karen Black's original by sheer vocal power alone. Likewise, Carolyn Mark's renditions of the Ronee Blakley numbers (""My Idaho Home"" and ""One, I Love You"") romp all over the original material. But outside of stirring up interest for an admittedly good movie, and occasional moments of stellar vocal work, I can't really figure out why one would want to buy this album on its own merits. Even the original soundtrack (found on vinyl with some ease at many friendly neighborhood Goodwills for about a dollar, give or take some scratches), removed from the film, is little more than a novelty piece. Nashville is a non-linear sort of musical, so you can't exactly follow the story by ear alone the way you could, say, Oklahoma. Maybe all those Altman/Neko Case fans will eat it up, but I'm holding out for the Drag City tribute to Gosford Park.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1938-nashville/,Mint,2002.0,"The Nashville Soundtrack is a musical project that has been in the making for years. The album was released in 2012, and it is a showcase for some of the best talents in the country music genre. The album features 20 tracks, performed by various artists including Connie Britton, Hayden Panettiere, and Charles Esten.

Personally, I am not a huge fan of country music, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this album. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed listening to it. The Nashville Soundtrack not only captures the essence of modern country music, but also provides a glimpse into the lives and struggles of aspiring artists in Nashville.

The album's creation story is a tale of ups and downs that perfectly reflects the long and winding road most musicians take on the journey to success. The album was created as part of the hit TV series, Nashville, which chronicles the lives of aspiring musicians and their journeys to fame. The show's creators commissioned a variety of artists to write and produce tracks for the series, and many of them were released on this album.

What I love about this album is the raw emotion that comes through in the songs. Tracks like ""Buried Under"" by Connie Britton and ""No One Will Ever Love You"" by Hayden Panettiere are perfect examples of how country music can capture human emotion in its purest form. The lyrics are vulnerable and honest, and the melodies perfectly complement the emotional depth of the songs.

Additionally, the musicality of this album is superb. The instrumentation is fantastic, with live instruments and great arrangements making it all come together. The album is crisp, polished, and sounds fantastic.

Overall, The Nashville Soundtrack is a great album for country music fans and anyone looking for an authentic musical experience. It tells the story of Nashville and the aspiring artists that call it home. The tracks are timeless and will transport you to another world, where life's struggles are laid bare in melodic, captivating ways.

Solex,Low Kick and Hard Bop,Electronic,6.8,June 3 2002,Paul Cooper,Contributor,"The Pitchfork precogs reached consensus. There wasn't even an inking of a minority report on Low Kick and Hard Bop. All three mutant visionaries reported that only Elisabeth Esselink (operational guise: Solex) could have created the splendidly chaotic beat-a-rama. But I consulted the Pitchfork precogs only out of curiosity. From the opening moments of the title track through to the closer, ""Look-- No Fingerprints!"" I couldn't mistake any of this album for someone else's work. The debut Solex album, Solex vs. the Hitmeister, sampled unwanted record store vinyl, telling personal tales of ripped stockings and Solex's Rolex. Solex album number two, Pick Up, sampled live performances and roughened up the gentler edges of the debut, but retained the minuscule vignettes of trivial activity. ""Oh Blimey"" tells of a woman pulling ""bits and bobs"" out of her pocket with all the glee of Björk, but none of the pixie princess' staged naiveté. Despite the commonplaceness of her lyrics, Esselink made sure that the musical accompaniment was far harsher thar before. Perhaps someone had offloaded a bunch of soundboard tapes by Minor Threat's Dutch equivalents. Though Low Kick and Hard Bop doesn't retreat from Pick Up's abrasiveness, it does draw its samples from a wider array of sources, with Esselink making far savvier choices of skitter-funk drum breaks to loop. Thus, Low Kick and Hard Bop takes far fewer listens to capture the listener. This third time around has given Esselink the opportunity to show off her near-perfect ability to mimic Fall song titles. ""Mere Imposters,"" ""Ease Up You Fundamentalists,"" and ""Look-- No Fingerprints!"" are just three examples of Esselink's appropriatior of Mark E. Smith's askance appellation engine. ""Mere Imposters"" deals with a formal apple-bobbing competition at a dinner party supervised by the waitstaff; ""Have You No Shame, Girl?"" depicts a catfight between dancing girls. I'm at a loss to figure out what ""Not a Hoot!"" is about, even though I find it ar irresistible bayou-bounce complete with gris-gris guitars and menacing backbeats. But what I find so engrossing about Low Kick and Hard Bop isn't the samples, it's how Esselink combines them and submits them to her idiosyncratic style. It's quite a feat to take quirky elements from so many diverse sources and make them coherent, to the extent that I don't even register that they're samples. They become part of the Solex entity. Even Esselink's vocal mannerism wavers, but remains unmistakably Solex. From swamp-thing growl to Tanya Donelly-does-a-Kathleen-Hanna-Valley-Girl-rant, Esselink stamps these styles with the Solex identity. Her ability to integrate discordant and heterogeneous elements leads me to believe that if Esselink was a shift manager at Subway, rather than a record shop owner, she'd as effortlessly construct something unique from three-day-old veggies and moldy bologna. Yet the consistency of Solex material is potentially the agent of its own downfall. Play Solex vs. the Hitmeister after Low Kick and Hard Bop and you might think that they were recorded at the same time, rather than four years apart. Low Kick Hard Bop offers nothing essentially different than past Solex releases. While I'm not asking for a duet with Peaches or a remix by the Streets, I would appreciate a new facet to the customary lo-fi diamond boogaloo. I quizzed the Pitchfork precogs with a 'wither Solex?' question. While two out of three precogs foresaw a sequin-and-Appletini future for Esselink in Vegas, I prefer the less radical modification to Solex as described in the dissenting report. Time will tell if the minority precog and I will be thoroughly satisfied.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7324-low-kick-and-hard-bop/,Matador,2001.0,"If you're a fan of innovative electronic music, you're going to want to take a listen to Solex's ""Low Kick and Hard Bop"". This album is full of surprises and truly pushes the boundaries of the electronic genre.

Solex has been making music since the mid 1990s, and their sound is a mix of electronic, pop, and experimental elements that come together in a way that's both accessible and unique. This album was released in 2001 and was largely created using vintage sound equipment, which gives the tracks a warm, analog feel.

Personally, I found the way the tracks on ""Low Kick and Hard Bop"" are put together to be particularly impressive. The songs are complex and layered, with each track building on the next. There's a sense of narrative to the album that makes it feel like a cohesive whole. In particular, I was blown away by the way the use of vocal samples is integrated into the music - taking on almost instrumental quality at times.

Another standout feature of the album is the attention to detail in the production. There's a lot going on in these tracks, but each sound is given space to breathe and is expertly placed in the mix. The album feels spacious and expansive, despite the complex soundscape.

For fans of more traditional electronic music, there might be moments on this album that feel a little too experimental. The blend of different genres and sounds might not be to everyone's taste. However, if you're looking for something that truly pushes the boundaries of electronic music, ""Low Kick and Hard Bop"" is definitely worth a listen.

Overall, I'd give this album a solid 7/10. It's not perfect - there are moments where the experimentation feels a little forced - but the creativity, attention to detail, and impressive sound design make it a standout in the electronic genre.

High on Fire,Blessed Black Wings,Metal,7.3,February 7 2005,Sam Ubl,,"On paper, Steve Albini's production style is the exact antithesis of what you'd want for your metal opus: big dank drumz and shrill, almost choked guitars, all gussied up in superfluous reverb and an air-tight low end. I've never listened to an Albini-produced band and not thought my ears were clogged. Sure, the man's 'nuff-said production credits go on and on, but I often wonder if a band like Mclusky would sound even more punishing if they were left out in the open, free of the silo 'verb and guitar strangulation. Still, Albini remains the preferred penis pump of underground rock acts of all stripes. He's on the speed dials of bands looking to get huge in that other sense. High on Fire already own one of the burliest sounds in metal, so what they were hoping to gain by phoning Albini isn't clear. The two seem an unlikely marriage anyway: High of Fire unleash a competent fury that thrives on warm-ish, tube amp'd guitars, and mainlined adrenal essence-- a far cry from Albini's balled-fist, hyper-compressed sludge treatments. 2002's Surrounded By Thieves was a tight-wound stoned-dead masterpiece; if the band were aching for change, they sure didn't play like it. High on Fire fans rejoice: Blessed Black Wings is the band you know and fear. Albini's influence is discreet, serving only to calcify the band's laser-cut attack. My only complaint with the sound is that Matt Pike's vocals-- more tuneful and comprehensible than the genre protocol-- are mixed down, so only the most glottal elements seep through. But perched atop Albini's distended low end, High on Fire are as toothy as they are flesh-searing. Previously, the band's raw energy was trapped in a self-imposed oubliette of standard gloom-n-doom; on Blessed Black Wings, they've busted out, terrorizing the masses with a sharper, more agile sound that will appeal to fans of Mastodon's Leviathan. But unlike Mastodon or prog-metal clairvoyants Converge, High on Fire don't seem the slightest bit preoccupied with the future; they're content to do what they do best as long as there are subtle unexplored pockets of terrain to be squatted on. Blessed Black Wings catapults full-throttle from the gate and scorches at 11 for nearly an hour, halting only for the occasional full-band kick. Avoiding polyrhythmic arabesques, High on Fire are almost antigravity: Their energy seems like it could last forever. Opener ""Devilution"" (now there's a subtle pun) splits the earth and stitches it back together, sending tom-bashing tremors through a landscape of bilious chugging and Voice of God vocals. ""The Face of Oblivion"" is less incendiary but no smaller, steering through a slow sooty opening before turning around in a smooth, economical breakdown that's grandiose sans bravado. Other highlights include ""To Cross the Bridge""-- a seven-minute epic that does the acoustic/electric guitar duel better than Converge or erstwhile Metallica by combining traits of both-- and ""Anointing of Seer"", whose gelatinous plunder gives way to a resplendent, fleeting riff around the 2:30 mark. Up in the elevated mercury of these six- and seven-minute sculptures, things can get muggy, but in terms of shear bombast, Albini has seldom worked with a more independently powerful group of musicians.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3864-blessed-black-wings/,Relapse,2005.0,"If you're looking for your daily dose of metal, then High on Fire's ""Blessed Black Wings"" is just what you need. With a rating of 7.3 out of 10, this album is a must-listen for fans of the metal genre.

High on Fire has been around for quite some time – over two decades to be exact. The band, consisting of Matt Pike, Jeff Matz, and Des Kensel, first formed in 1998 and has been delivering hard-hitting metal ever since. ""Blessed Black Wings"" was released in 2005, and it quickly became a fan favorite.

The album's creation story is one that is filled with passion and inspiration. Prior to recording ""Blessed Black Wings,"" High on Fire had gone through a number of changes, but what remained constant was their commitment to creating music that was powerful and authentic. As a testament to this commitment, Pike, the band's guitarist and vocalist, had even overcome a near-death experience to record the album. All these elements came together to create an album that was not only complex and expertly crafted, but also one that was deeply personal to the members of the band.

As I listened to the album, I found myself drawn in by the raw energy that emanated from each track. From the intense guitar solos in ""Devilution"" to the heavy drums in ""Cometh Down Hessian,"" High on Fire delivers a sound that is both unrelenting and intoxicating. The vocals are gravelly and guttural, adding an extra layer of depth to each song.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Sons of Thunder."" The slow, deliberate pace of the song allows for the lyrics to be fully appreciated – they're about the band's love for music and their willingness to sacrifice everything for it. It's a sentiment that I think any musician can relate to.

Overall, ""Blessed Black Wings"" is an album that truly showcases High on Fire's talent and dedication to the metal genre. At times, the music can be overwhelming, but that's what makes it so great – it's unapologetically bold and unrelenting. If you're a fan of metal, then this album is definitely worth a listen.

Manitoba,Up in Flames,"Electronic,Rock",8.6,April 3 2003,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Something must have happened to Manitoba's Dan Snaith. His 2001 debut for the Leaf label, Start Breaking My Heart, was blissed-out pastoral IDM that warranted Boards of Canada comparisons. Then he went off and made some clubby tracks that dabbled in UK garage. And now, with his second full-length Up in Flames, he's chucked the laptop, dug the analog gear out of the dumpster, and recorded a 60s-worshiping indie pop record, complete with sun-kissed harmonies, layered acoustic guitars, Farfisa organ drones and glockenspiel. You have to admire the chutzpah. Seriously, I can't remember hearing this stark a contrast between consecutive albums in a long time, maybe ever. The sound of Up in Flames is key. In contrast to the world of modern computer-based music, where noise is precisely controlled and each layered instrument can be mentally plucked from the mix and examined, Up in Flames is a colossal field of unified sound. The sheets of acoustic guitar and organ wrap themselves around the booming drums (mostly acoustic kits tuned to the full timbre of the Hal Blaine era) and you can't pry them apart. The obvious production inspirations are Phil Spector and Brian Wilson, both of whom arranged songs during a time when men had more ideas than available tracks; producers were forced to cheat in those days-- to bounce and to compress-- and the best records to come out of that period were massive and unknowable as a result. Up in Flames, whether by choice or necessity, has the same warm feeling of ramshackle Wagner. When it came time to record, precision was clearly a goal far down the list. Despite their obvious 60s references, most of the tracks on Up in Flames aren't really songs in the traditional sense. Instead of prominent verse/chorus/bridge structures, we hear a series of swells and contractions. Snaith has a good understanding of the tricks and techniques of pop's biggest and best moments, the moments that stop your breath during the pause just before the big chorus, and he set out to make an album filled with them. ""Hendrix with Ko"" (which is one of a couple songs featuring the voice of Koushik Ghosh) has some lyrics, but most of what you hear are just day-glo bah-bah-bah's that serve as suspension cabling to carry the track from one section to the next, through the Mamas & Papas homage to an electronic coda that's a rare memory of Manitoba's prior incarnation. ""Jacknuggeted"" has a similar arc, but reminds me more of Neil Diamond in his Bang Records days-- all ""Cherry Cherry"" handclaps and stiff-but-funky D/A/G acoustic strumming-- before another digital breakdown brings in sputtering breaks that would have had Greenwich & Barry lunging for the ""stop"" button. As tied to the 60s as it is, Up in Flames can also be described as ""psychedelic."" The way the absolutely huge ""Bijoux"" swirls with Wilsonian harmonies, layers of chords, music boxes, percussion explosions and orchestral samples, I swear it almost takes on a Boredoms cast-- not in terms of aggression, but as a primal celebration of the possibility of sound. ""Kid You'll Move Mountains"" is similarly dense, but this one sends a snaking soprano saxophone through the changes. A tenor sax erupts in the latter part of ""Skunks"", tearing off into a series of riffs that add the same sort of ""free"" element to the track that Stereolab incorporated into ""Fuses"". The fuzzy ""Crayon"", meanwhile, sounds like Múm covering The Jesus & Mary Chain's ""Taste of Cindy"". If Snaith were to follow the trend of most electronic producers, he'd have changed his alias for this project, the way Atom Heart does with Señor Coconut-- though I'll grant that there's some conceptual overlap: Up in Flames certainly has a wide-eyed and affirmative outlook, and features titles like ""Every Time She Turns Around It's Her Birthday"" to go with Start Breaking My Heart's ""Children Play Well Together"", and there are a few brief moments where Snaith's IDM head pops out of the fabric. But that's as far as it goes; the two albums aren't in the same universe. Is Snaith confused? Maybe he wants it all. Maybe he doesn't know what he wants. But because Up in Flames is such a great record, we win either way. ",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5077-up-in-flames/,Leaf,2003.0,"Buckle up folks, because Manitoba's ""Up in Flames"" is one heck of a ride. This early 2000s electronic-rock masterpiece deserves every bit of its 8.6 rating, and then some. It's an album that manages to be both meticulously crafted and effortlessly cool; a testament to the genius of its sole creator, Dan Snaith.

Snaith's journey to making ""Up in Flames"" is a fascinating one. Originally working under the moniker ""Manitoba,"" he was forced to change his name after a legal battle with musician ""Handsome Dick"" Manitoba. But that didn't stop him from setting out to make an album that would truly solidify his place in the music world.

From the opening track, ""I've Lived on a Dirt Road All My Life,"" it's clear that this isn't going to be your average electronic album. Instead, it's an intricate blend of electronic beats, rock guitar riffs, and psychedelic harmonies that somehow manages to feel both nostalgic and incredibly futuristic at the same time.

Highlights of the album include the wildly catchy ""Jacknuggeted,"" which features a funky bassline and lyrics that are simultaneously silly and deeply heartfelt. Then there's ""Twins,"" a hauntingly beautiful track that showcases Snaith's talent for layering different sounds and creating a sense of atmosphere.

But perhaps the real gem of ""Up in Flames"" is the way it manages to tell a story. Each track flows seamlessly into the next, creating a sense of momentum and purpose that's incredibly rare in electronic music. Snaith has an uncanny ability to weave different sounds and textures together to create a cohesive whole that's greater than the sum of its parts.

The album's title is apt; ""Up in Flames"" is a fiery explosion of sound that demands your attention from start to finish. It's the kind of album that you'll want to listen to on repeat, picking up on new details and nuances with each spin.

Personal experience-wise, ""Up in Flames"" has been a constant in my music collection for over a decade now. It's an album that's seen me through all kinds of ups and downs, and has always managed to lift my spirits and make me feel like anything is possible. It's an album that I recommend wholeheartedly to anyone who's looking for something truly special and unforgettable. So if you haven't given Manitoba a chance yet, what are you waiting for?

Skaters,Manhattan,,4.8,February 27 2014,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"Last week, the Village Voice published its list of the 50 Most NYC Albums Ever, a feature that illustrated the myriad ways—from West Side Story to Ramones to On the 6—in which the five boroughs have been mythologized in song over the past 60-odd years. Coincidentally enough, just days later, New York quartet Skaters issued their own listicle of Big Apple rock-history signifiers—they just happened to do it in the form of their debut record. It’s an album about living in Manhattan titled Manhattan. There’s a song about what it’s like to be young in NYC called “To Be Young in NYC”. There are between-song snippets of young women complaining about sublets in uncannily Shosh-like voices. And it's no exaggeration to say this album—and its major-label patronage—would not exist without the modernized grot-rock of the Strokes’ Is This It. But in contrast to that unimpeachable document of pre-9/11, Giuliani-era jollies, Manhattan is the rock‘n’roll analogue to a post-Bloomberg New York, where skyrocketing rents—and the big-box chains that can afford them—can make some city blocks look like Anytown USA. If the Strokes savvily refashioned NYC iconoclasts like the Velvet Underground and Television as dance-party pop music, Manhattan is what’s become of your head-shop CBGB t-shirt after another 12 years of laundromat visits. Each of the 11 songs here are positioned at some point in an endless cycle of going out, scoping girls, getting drunk, making out, passing out, and “waking up in [your] clothes.” But for Skaters, such scenes are apparently so routine that they often sound disinterested in their own debauchery: On the opening track, “One of Us”, frontman Michael Ian Cummings sums up another messy night on the town by blithely repeating the words “fun and games” with an audible shrug that suggests he’d rather be at home catching up on House of Cards. It’s a blasé attitude that’s reflected in the band’s intensely streamlined sound, which retains the fuzz and buzz of post-millennial mainstream garage-rock, but is synth-smoothed and rhythmically processed to the point of sterlity. And the dabbles with electro blips (“I Wanna Dance But I Don't Know How”) and half-baked hardcore (“Nice Hat”) ultimately dilute rather than diversify the band’s personality; you’ll hear more credible reggae than “Bandbreaker” in your local karaoke bar’s backing track for “Underneath It All.” But if Skaters' version of Manhattan feels overly insular and one-dimensional, they at least come by it honestly: Upon arriving from L.A. in 2012, Cummings reportedly spent his first year in New York working as a bartender, giving him a nightly front-row seat to a parade of self-indulgence. And in his more inspired moments, he evinces the smarm and charm (if not the knockout lyricism) of another guy who's seen his fair share of last calls, Paul Westerberg. Really, if the reunited Replacements decided to make a new record in 2014, they could do worse than crank out new-waved power-pop pick-me-ups like “Schemers” or the aforementioned “To Be Young in NYC”, whose shout-out to “a generation of jerks, directionless on our feet” scans as a post-millennial update of “Bastards of Young.” However, it's the song dedicated to an unattainable rival-state beauty that, ironically, best fulfills Manhattan’s soundtrack-to-the-city mission: “Miss Teen Massachusetts”, which boasts the album's most towering hook and convincingly restless performance. It just goes to show that it takes a lot more to capture the spirit of New York City in song than sampling conversations with cab drivers or rhyming “Harlem” with “problem”; with its churning groove and pleading, stressed-out vocal, “Miss Teen Massachusetts” counts as the rare moment where Skaters seem less concerned about describing what life in Manhattan looks and sounds like, and more into communicating how it really feels.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19023-skaters-manhattan/,Warner Bros.,2014.0,"If you’re looking for a nostalgic and moody album with an indie rock flair, Skaters' ""Manhattan"" is definitely worth your attention. The band, composed of Michael Ian Cummings (vocals and guitar), Noah Rubin (drums), and Dan Burke (bass), formed in New York City in 2011, and since then, they have been creating music that is both unique and true to their New York roots.

The ""Manhattan"" album represents a departure from the band's earlier work. It’s an introspective and dark album that reflects on the band's history and the city that they call home. In some ways, it can be seen as a love letter to the city, with its lyrics exploring the chaos and beauty of city life.

The story behind the album's creation is also worth mentioning. Skaters recorded the album in Los Angeles with producer Rob Schnapf, who has worked with artists like Beck and Elliott Smith. This change of scenery helped the band to approach their songwriting from a new perspective, and it resulted in an album that feels fresh and innovative while still being true to the band's signature sound.

Personally, I was impressed by how Skaters managed to create an album that is cohesive and yet diverse. Each song feels unique, yet they all fit together to create an atmospheric and immersive listening experience. The album's opening track, ""One of Us,"" sets the tone for the entire album with its driving rhythm, intense vocals, and intricate guitar work.

Another standout track is ""Mental Case,"" which showcases Cummings' unique vocal style and the band's ability to create a catchy chorus. The song is an anthem for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider, with lyrics that touch on themes of mental health and self-acceptance. 

The album's weaknesses, however, lie in the song's tendency to blend together with no distinguishable differences. The sound falls flat after the opening track with most of the songs sounding relatively similar in style with the exception of ""Mental Case.""

Overall, Skaters' ""Manhattan"" is a great addition to the indie rock genre. Despite a few shortcomings, the album is still a strong artistic achievement for the band. With its introspective lyrics, catchy melodies, and innovative sound, ""Manhattan"" is a must-listen for anyone who loves moody indie rock with a New York edge.","1.

High Rise,High Rise II,Rock,8.4,February 13 2018,Patrick St. Michel,Contributor,"Western listeners have long been drawn to underground Japanese music that falls between genres. Once the domain of pricey imports and fanzine pages, this decade has seen compilations such as Chee Shimizu’s More Better Days gather off-beat pop that draws from all over the global map, while labels like Palto Flats and WRWTFWW Records get rarities back into Western rotation. One of the most ambitious reissues projects comes from Black Editions, which is bringing out-of-print gems from Hideo Ikezumi’s psych-rock-leaning PSF label. Their latest is a fixture of Japanese underground rock, the second album from the Tokyo band High Rise. It’s a frantic set of blow-out garage rock that lives at their stylized intersection of psych, free jazz, and punk—a fiery testament to these Japanese artists’ ability to sever themselves from existing music communities to create something all their own, and capture a singular, high-energy moment in their careers. High Rise officially came together in 1982, centered around bassist and vocalist Asahito Nanjo and guitarist Munehiro Narita. Both grew up listening to imported Western music—Nanjo obsessed with any soundtrack he could find, Narita exposed to the Doors, Pink Floyd and Wilson Pickett among others via an uncle—before venturing into even more eclectic territory, developing a playing style heavily shaped by groups like Grand Funk Railroad and Blue Cheer. Punk, free jazz, and no wave caught both of their attention, as did domestic projects such as early Keiji Haino outfit Lost Aaraaff and the band Friction (featuring Reck, an early member of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks). The pair found themselves briefly playing in the same shadowy psych band, Kosokuya, but soon grew restless. “I decided to do something ‘hard’ with the people I got on best with,” Nanjo said in an interview. The pair started playing as Psychedelic Speed Freaks, a name obvious about that Tokyo record store owner Hideo Ikeezumi asked them to change it before he put out their debut album on his label because it was too direct. They renamed themselves High Rise—after J.G. Ballard's 1975 novel—and in 1984 put out Psychedelic Speed Freaks, their first album and the accidental namesake of Ikeezumi’s fledgling label. High Rise, though, set the template for future PSF groups, if not sonically than at least in attitude. Their feedback-stained improvised rock drew from the wild jazz and avant-garde communities dotting Japan, but with a rock backbone provided by Narita’s guitar playing. “We didn’t have a position,” Najo says of their place in the Japanese music world, and they’ve never sounded like they lamented it. High Rise II marked the crest of the band’s fried-out psych, partially because they found Yuro Ujiie, a drummer who could actually keep up with Najo and Narita. High Rise have cycled through drummers at a quick clip over the last few decades, but Ujiie was the only one to push the central pair into their most fertile territory. It’s not just about swiftness, although cuts like “Last Rites” and “Turn You Cry” are among their quickest salvos. Just as important was Ujiie’s ability to hang with two players ready to veer off in different directions at any second, lending II a more manic energy than their locked-in debut. Not that you would notice, at least right away. Critical to II’s atmosphere is how the drums get mixed lower, putting the emphasis on the fuzz-soaked bass and guitar. Ujiie provided propulsion, but it’s more subtle across High Rise’s second full-length, pushing songs forward but staying just out of the spotlight. Same goes for Nanjo’s vocals, coated in distortion and tough to make out. “They’re just various bits of English junky slang strung together. They just say that if you want to take drugs, you’re going to have to be prepared to die,” Nanjo has said of his lyrics, pointing to the group’s foundational theme of being anti-drugs (“The concept was to save the junkies”). Still, every word gets obscured by sound, rendering Nanjo’s singing as an unnerving (and, frequently, catchy) detail rather than something to really dwell on. High Rise created a cult because of the way the guitar and bass tore off across their songs. As relayed in interviews, the group didn’t create songs as much as they made concepts, improvisations that sounded focused. Narita’s guitar playing goes a long way here, tearing apart the heavy groove of “Cotton Top” and darting across “Wipe Out’s” rush of bass and drum fills. If Nanjo and Ujiie were more in sync and creating a constricting squall, Narita added the rush of on-the-edge oblivion that gives II such a dizzying vibe. Comparing faster cuts like “Turn You Cry” and “Last Rites” to hellacious motorcycle chases works well—the guitarist described High Rise’s music as “like seeing a traffic accident happen right in front of you.” The same reckless plunge forward even comes through on II’s one extended jam, the 13-minute whirlwind “Pop Sicle,” a number bringing to mind the slow-burn dirges of Les Rallizes Denudes sped up and frayed. Black Editions reissue presents what they call the “definitive version” of II, mixed and mastered by Nanjo. He makes sure the guitars come to the fore of this 2018 version, maintaining the wild energy of the original. Two bonus songs originally found on a PSF CD version released in 1993 also appear here—the chug-a-lug of “Monster a Go Go” is as close as High Rise came to sounding like a conventional rock band, and earns its status as an extra. Far better is “Induced Depression,” a psych blast more in line with the shorter numbers on II featuring some particularly busy solos courtesy of Narita. II caught High Rise at their most confident and adventurous—future releases would find Nanjo, Narita and whoever could handle the kit slowing down, or with the singing and drums coming through more clearly, while all involved would venture off into multiple other groups, like the more structured Mainliner or Musica Transonic. It’s on this 1986 release, though, where they are most eager to blaze their own path, not just far removed from the glitzy sounds of mainstream Japanese music during the bubble years but from other underground artists. II holds nothing back, but it also features catchier elements separating it from the pure bludgeoning of Merzbow and other “Japanoise” acts, while also being more muscular than the dramatic sounds of labelmate Haino. No shortage of niche acts popping up in Tokyo’s live-houses sound like High Rise, but the real legacy to glean from II is that of a band embracing their independence and going their own way.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/high-rise-high-rise-ii/,Black Editions,1986.0,"If there's one band that can make hard rock sound as if it's just a walk in the park, it has to be High Rise. With the release of their newest album 'High Rise II,' the Japanese legends of the rock scene once again showed the world how it's done. 

High Rise has been around since the late '80s, and over the years, they've become one of the most influential Japanese bands in the experimental rock scene. The band's frontman, Munehiro Narita, is a legendary guitarist who has honed his craft for over five decades now. Bassist Asahito Nanjo and drummer Ichiraku Yoshimitsu complete the band's lineup, and together, they've crafted some of the most genre-defying rock music out there.

'High Rise II' is the band's second album, released 27 years after their first album of the same name. According to the band, they had no plans of releasing another album with the same name, but the idea came up one day during a recording session, and they just went along with it.

Listening to the album, it's clear that High Rise had no shortage of inspiration when crafting these tracks. From the opening riffs of ""Last Rites,"" it's apparent that this is going to be a loud and visceral ride. The song builds up to an explosive climax that sets the tone for the rest of the album.

Tracks like ""Pop Sicle"" and ""Meguroo"" showcase the band's ability to meld catchy melodies with fiery guitar solos and thunderous drums. It's a combination that could easily sound overbearing in the hands of any other band, but High Rise manages to strike a perfect balance.

To be completely honest, there are a few moments on the album where the band seems to be in full-on jam mode, where they're just letting loose and seeing where the music takes them. But even in these moments, the band's chemistry is so palpable that it's hard not to get swept up in the music.

As a long-time fan of High Rise, I was excited to hear about the release of 'High Rise II', and I wasn't disappointed with the results. It's clear that this band has no shortage of creative energy, even after all these years in the industry. With a rating of 8.4 out of 10, this album is a must-listen for any fan of classic rock and experimental music alike.

"Tim Hecker, Daniel Lopatin",Instrumental Tourist,Experimental,7.5,November 30 2012,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"In the world of instrumental electronic music, you're nothing without your own sound. Without vocals and without an instrument that you can manipulate with your body, it's harder to insert ""you"" into the music. And harder still to have that ""you"" be so thoroughly ""you"" that listeners pick up on it and can identify you from your sonics alone. Both Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin (better known as Oneohtrix Point Never) have gotten there. Each has his own aesthetic and you can hear them inside of it. Hecker's is more immediately identifiable. Since 2001's Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again, he's created a run of good-to-amazing albums that are typically built on static and shifting drones, number-crunching music that is also intensely physical and tactile. Lopatin's approach is comparatively playful and also more steeped in appropriation, as he finds ways to incorporate the cast-off music of the past and make something that is both affecting and very much of this moment. When listening to a record by either Hecker or Lopatin, you get a strong sense of the minds and sensibilities behind the music. Hecker and Lopatin admire each other's work and move in some of the same circles. Earlier this year, at Lopatin's urging, they got together to experiment. Crucially, they were actually in the same room together for the project, sharing sketches and creating new music in real time. When so much music is being made by sharing files online, the fact that they actually played together and improvised is unusual and gives the album a unique quality. Here and there you can hear artifacts from the sessions, like the ""Are you ready? We're recording..."" voices very quietly at the opening of ""Vaccination (for Thomas Mann)"", which reinforce the air of spontaneity. One precedent for this sort of project comes from artists both producers admire, the collaborations between Christian Fennesz, Jim O'Rourke, and Peter Rehberg under the name Fenn O'Berg. But while those collaborations could be dense and heavily abstract, Instrumental Tourist is an easy listen, loaded with billowy atmosphere and discernible melody. It's almost eerie in how you can hear the melding of two sounds. On tracks like ""Intrusions"", ""Grey Geisha"", and ""Vaccination No. 2"", Hecker's blown-out digital shoegaze forms the basis of the tracks while Lopatin adds quasi global accents on top. On tracks like ""Vaccination (for Thomas Mann)"" and ""Racist Drone"", Lopatin's thinner new age tones dominate and the accents are Hecker's. The overall mood drifts from lightly narcotic bliss to mild tension and then back again, but the album hangs together. The way these things usually work, it's unlikely that every ""Hecker-like"" sound comes from him and vice-versa. But it's uncanny how much these tracks sound like two guys jamming and bringing their individual voices into a shared context. For someone deeply attuned to these guys' careers, listening for their individual contributions is both fun and slightly distracting. They sound good together and the meshing of their sounds is seamless, but both are known more for meticulously crafted tracks honed over long periods of time, and albums that string tracks together in a coherent way. Instrumental Tourist, while listenable, doesn't hide its more sketch-driven beginnings. It's an album more about process; you feel like you are hearing something at the moment of creation and, relative to the recent full-lengths these two have made on their own, there's less of a pull to return to the music and see how it all works. It's also, at 55 minutes, on the long side, and there aren't quite enough ideas being batted back and forth to justify the length. But it's an enjoyable detour, one that affirms how well these producers have honed their approaches to sound.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17327-instrumental-tourist/,Software,2012.0,"As a lover of experimental music, I was thrilled to come across Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin's collaborative album ""Instrumental Tourist"". This album falls under the experimental genre, which can be incredibly hit or miss in terms of its appeal to a wider audience. However, I would like to say that the album surpasses all expectations and showcases the masterful talent of these two exceptional musicians.

Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin have had glittering solo careers with their unique styles, but together they manage to create a distinctive sound that is both complex and mesmerizing. The album was created after a chance meeting in a studio session, which spurred their decision to collaborate. Inspired by their exchange of ideas, the duo embarked on an instrumental journey across Canada to record the album.

The album consists of 10 tracks and ranges from short, atmospheric pieces to longer, more dramatic tracks. One thing that sets Instrumental Tourist apart from other experimental albums is its use of a range of instruments. The duo uses an array of instruments such as guitar, synths, horns and strings, which gives the album a diverse and captivating sound.

The opening track, ""Uptown Psychedelia,"" sets the tone for the rest of the album with its percussive beats and cinematic synths. ""Scene from a French Zoo"" immediately follows and presents a sonic journey through an imaginary French zoo. As we progress through the album, one can see the depth of the experimentation with the various instruments.

Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin's incredible synergy is evident through the perfectly timed transitions between tracks. It's also impressive how each track manages to sound distinct, while still fitting harmoniously within an album that isn't constrained to any particular genre.  The track ""Grey Geisha"" is a perfect example of this, with its haunting melody and profound serenity, transporting the listener to a mystical wonderland.

In my personal opinion, the album does require multiple listens to fully appreciate the nuances that Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin bring to it. The album is not something you can breeze through and fully grasp the depth of its intricacies. One needs to let the music settle in and reveal the hidden layers that are not immediately apparent on the first listen.

In conclusion, Instrumental Tourist is a remarkable experimental album that truly pushes the boundaries of music. While at first listen, it may seem confusing and chaotic, but after multiple listens, it becomes a beautiful tapestry of sound, exploring the multitudes of emotions that music can evoke. I would recommend this album to any adventurous music lover looking to experience something unique, challenging and awe-inspiring. I give this album a solid rating of 7.5 out of 10 for its complexity, depth, and creativity.","1.

The Tough Alliance,The New School,Electronic,8.5,September 17 2008,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"A band is like a team is like a gang is like an army. Swedish electro-poppers the Tough Alliance are just a duo-- Eric Berglund and Henning Fürst-- but their name can suggest all of those meanings. So can their music, albeit through sweet melodies, shiny dance beats, and blindingly idealistic self-expression. Last year's A New Chance and 2006's New Waves EP explore a broader sonic palette, developing the dreamier qualities of 2006's mostly instrumental excursion Escaping Your Ambitions, but never have TTA sounded more muscular or dance party-ready than on 2005 debut The New School. The New School has a hidden track with a Liverpool crowd thundering out the terrace anthem ""You'll Never Walk Alone"". ""Tough II"" could be TTA's own theme song, an inspirational opening with choppy, pitched-up vocals and imposingly high synths. ""In the Kitchen"" finds the duo in ""pole position"", where they shout such future Nike slogans as ""life's a mission""; bird-backed ""My Hood"" puts on for Fürst and Berglund's city. But lest you think all the titles could double as R. Kelly songs, TTA are family-friendly enough to have their own product endorsement of sorts: ""Koka-Kola Veins"", with its ""blah blah blah"" chorus and ""just wanna have some fun"" credo, remains the duo's catchiest and most dancefloor-friendly track to date. When TTA declare, ""Against my baseball bat/ No one has a chance,"" on the joyfully delinquent ""Make It Happen"", though, it's safe to assume they aren't bragging about reading Charlie Lau, Jr.'s The Art of Hitting .400. ""Forget about labor/ It's time to wake the neighbors,"" they add. The setting could be a party, a fight, or a rowdy sexual encounter, and the song's original placement on an EP with a 50 Cent cover doesn't provide as much helpful context as you'd think. On ""Koka-Kola Veins"" they tell us, ""We've got our own jihad, if you know what I mean."" I don't. ""Break the rules,"" suggests ""Keep It Pure"". Now we're getting somewhere. ""Don't test us,"" TTA threaten on ""Forever Utd."", but there's more bliss than menace in their cameraderie. Both here and on the coral reef-lush ""Keep It Pure"", TTA hint at their blissed-out future, evoking the imagery of compatriots Studio, Air France, and the Embassy. Time spent with the right person can be paradise, the beatific ""Holiday"" suggests, but this kind of escape, made dazzlingly vivid in the three videos included with the new The New School, also has a childlike quality. ""We can't feel as good as when we make believe,"" they claim on ""Koka-Kola Veins"", staking out imagination as part of the sincerity-as-ethos embodied on A New Chance. For all their cheap pop thrills on one hand, and lofty interview pronouncements on the other, TTA are just a band. Berglund and Fürst acknowledge this like fans, hiding Easter eggs alluding to rock, hip-hop, and pop  in their songs for their most obsessive listeners to find. They nod twice to Spacemen 3, their careening, circus-ready electro-pop cover of Primal Scream's ""Velocity Girl"", renamed ""Velocity Boy"", appears on the reissue as another part of the hidden track, and elsewhere they slyly recall Pink Floyd, the Paragons, Blondie, and the Notorious B.I.G. This practice is made explicit on bonus track ""Take No Heroes"", modeled on Daft Punk's name-dropping ""Teachers"" (and later sampled by Jens Lekman). ""Take no heroes, only inspiration,"" TTA advise, and for this divisive, galvanizing, all-or-nothing band, it could be its rallying cry. The message also should ring true for your band, team, gang, or army. Kick over the statues. The shoulders of greatness are there for the standing.

And only losers lose.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12183-the-new-school/,"Service,Service",2005.0,"When The Tough Alliance released their album 'The New School', the electronic music scene was abuzz with anticipation of something truly original and groundbreaking. The Swedish duo, composed of Henning Fürst and Eric Berglund, had already made a name for themselves with their previous albums, but 'The New School' was expected to showcase a new level of creativity and experimentation. And boy, did they deliver.

While the duo had always been interested in exploring different styles and musical genres, 'The New School' truly pushed the boundaries of what was expected of electronic music. The album is a masterclass in blending disparate sounds and influences, from hip-hop beats to indie guitar riffs, to create something truly unique and alien.

As with most experimental music, there are moments where the songs can be challenging to listen to, but overall the album is an incredibly satisfying experience. The melodies are infectious and the lyrics are both funny and thought-provoking. Fürst and Berglund's voices blend together perfectly, creating a soundscape that is etherial and otherworldly.

One of the standout tracks, 'First Class Riot', features a scintillating beat that drives the song forward, while the lyrics lament the failure of contemporary society to live up to its promise. The chorus is unforgettable, and I find myself humming it for days afterward.

Overall, 'The New School' is an album that demands your attention and rewards your patience. While it may not be for everyone, those who are looking for something genuinely new and exciting in the world of electronic music should give it a listen. It's a testament to The Tough Alliance's artistry and willingness to take risks, and it's an album that I will be listening to for years to come.","1.

Nate Ruess,Grand Romantic,Pop/R&B,5.5,June 23 2015,Jeremy Gordon,Contributor,"Nathaniel Joseph Ruess, age 33, is what we call a rock star in 2015. He has a bleeding heart, a big voice right out of musical theatre, and a pair of #1 singles under his belt. His band, fun., is one of those subversion-free mainstream rock bands—think Imagine Dragons or Mumford and Sons—to become chart staples during Obama’s presidency, which must undoubtedly perturb Kid Rock types prone to caterwauling about how rock stars used to kick ass. (If it helps, Ruess wrote “We Are Young” after getting kicked out of a cab for being too drunk.) Now, after a decade of performing with bands like fun. and the Format, Ruess has recorded a solo album that presents him as both soulful troubadour and arena hero—equal parts Van Morrison and Bruce Springsteen—with mixed returns. Grand Romantic comes with less fanfare than the debut album from fun. guitarist Jack Antonoff, who benefited from generous pre-release hype perhaps owing to his status as one-half of a power couple with “Girls” creator Lena Dunham. Antonoff’s album, recorded as Bleachers, was musically capable, but his voice wouldn’t stick out at a cocktail party. Ruess’s voice is milk and honey, on the other hand, but his song selection is comparably generic. Grand Romantic’s default mode is pro forma stadium rock: booming drums, moments of piano-driven clarity before some string-driven hurrah, perfunctory “la la”s and “na na” harmonies, a key change on a chorus or bridge that lets us know he’s really going for it. The marriage of Ruess’ vocal theatrics to Antonoff’s ear for layered songwriting brings otherwise-mundane sentiments (being young is great; so is going out at night) within reach of transcendence. Apart, they lack definition. Ruess calls himself a grand romantic, but he’s weathered enough heartbreak to be reasonable about what the world holds. “I think that the album is very romantic, but not in some sort of overt buying-flowers-for-someone type of way,” he told MTV. That’s a funny thing to say about an album whose lead single is “Nothing Without Love”—opening line: “I am nothing without love”—but contrary to his stadium rock instincts, Ruess is more convincing with the lights dimmed. The balladry of “Take It Back” is wrapped around a tortured guitar solo played by Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, while Beck pops in for an adult contemporary duet on the country-tinged “What This World Is Coming To”. “Moment” offers a particularly tender vocal performance, with Ruess sounding so dejected about a failed entanglement you want to reach through the speakers and pat him on the head. Much of the album was co-written with Jeff Bhasker and Emile Haynie, veteran songwriters who’ve won awards working with stars like Kanye West, Lana Del Rey, Beyonce, and Taylor Swift. Ruess doesn’t have such an idiosyncratic personality, either as a pop star or a lyricist. (“Probably my biggest thing is that I just have a tough time sitting down and really committing to writing lyrics,” he tells Rolling Stone.) What he has is unflinching earnestness. He quotes E.E. Cummings like some beret-adorned fop on “AhHa”, and on “Brightside”, is completely unafraid to tell someone, ”I can see the Louvre shining in your eyes.” There’s no ponderous pose or hint of darkness like you’d get from Brandon Flowers or Julian Casablancas. His perspective is unapologetically, blissfully unspecific, a GIF wall of the 28 Reasons Life Is Going To Be Okay. That doesn’t make those lines about the Louvre go down any easier, but it helps you think of him as less a self-styled Great Man, and more a man who thinks the world can be great. “You Light My Fire” is a gloriously schmaltzy pop song replete with percussive xylophone plinks and hand claps—you can see Ruess mugging and snapping his fingers for “The Today Show” crowd. The title obviously recalls the Doors classic, but amusingly enough, Ruess wasn’t familiar with it. (To Rolling Stone: “People have lit a fire before. I'm sure it's not big deal."") Where Jim Morrison moaned about having extremely mysterious sex, Ruess goes complete cornball, bopping to and fro about this girl who revs him up. It’s a little goofy, and absolutely over-the-top, but he sounds natural—a welcoming moment where his antics coalesce around an identifiable personality. It shows how Ruess might succeed on his own as a good-hearted Midwestern boy—not quite a star, but someone capable of appreciating their light.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20717-grand-romantic/,Fueled by Ramen,2015.0,"The music industry is always in constant motion, producing hit after hit, but some of those songs are far more special than others. The same could be said of Nate Ruess' Pop/R&B album ""Grand Romantic."" The album, with a rating of 5.5 out of 10, may not be a masterpiece, but it's a worthy addition to any playlist that caters to those who are fond of emotive pop music.

Before jumping into the album itself, let's take a quick look at the artist. Nate Ruess, for those who may not know, is a well-established singer and songwriter whose experience in the music industry goes back years. In the mid-2000s, he co-founded the indie-pop band ""The Format,"" and in 2008, his career hit a new high when he teamed up with Jack Antonoff and Andrew Dost to form ""Fun."" With ""Fun,"" he gained a massive following thanks to chart-topping hits like ""We Are Young"" and ""Some Nights."" After touring relentlessly, Ruess took a hiatus to focus on his solo endeavors and released ""Grand Romantic"" in 2015.

Now, speaking of ""Grand Romantic,"" the album is an eclectic mix of pop and R&B with a hint of soul – a showcase of Nate Ruess' raw musical talent. The songs on the album are a stark departure from Ruess' previous band, ""Fun."" Instead of the anthemic, enthusiastic tunes that his previous band was known for, ""Grand Romantic"" delivers a more subdued and mature sound. While the album has its upbeat moments, such as the track ""AhHa"" and the album opener ""Grand Romantic,"" the majority of the album is made up of ballads and mid-tempo tracks that showcase Ruess' soulful vocals.

The album's strength lies in its authenticity, and the album acts as a perfect encapsulation of Nate Ruess' life experiences, struggles, and emotions. I found myself drawn to tracks such as ""Take It Back"" and ""Great Big Storm"" due to the stories they convey. ""Take It Back"" is a raw and emotional track about losing something important and trying to reclaim it. ""Great Big Storm,"" on the other hand, is a reflective and nostalgic tune that feels personal as it invites the listener to delve deep into Ruess' experiences.

The album's production is on-point, thanks to the involvement of multi-faceted producer Jeff Bhasker. He perfectly balances the album's diverse musical sound and Ruess' emotive lyrics, creating a cohesive project that represents the artist's vision. While the album falls short of a few things, such as it's pacing and the occasional lackluster track, these shortcomings shouldn't detract from the album's overall quality.

In conclusion, ""Grand Romantic"" is an album that is worth listening to. Its authenticity and Nathan Ruess' soulful vocals make the album stand out, even if it's not his best work. The album explores a different facet of Ruess' artistry, and the result is an impressive musical project. For those looking for an emotional and soulful pop/R&B experience, ""Grand Romantic"" should undoubtedly be on your playlist.","Step 1: Review A has a more informal style and uses colloquial language, while Review B has a more formal tone and a more structured approach.

Calexico,Edge of the Sun,Rock,7.6,April 22 2015,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"A vintage synth belches out an insistent theme to open the noisy ""Cumbia de Donde"", a standout on Calexico’s new album. It’s one of the most striking moments on Edge of the Sun, a rusty tangle of staccato notes and syncopation atop a sinewy percussion groove. Not only does it chafe against the band’s default folk rock, but that central riff acts as a sort of code, as though the Tucson collective is offering coordinates for a northerly route connecting South and North, Sonora with San Francisco. It’s a song about origins (""¿De dónde eres?"") and destinations (""¿Adónde vas?""), punctuated by the dots and dashes of a conspiratorial horn section. ""I’m not from here, I’m not from there,"" Joey Burns sings, imbuing this itinerancy with power and possibility. Taking over vocals at the bridge, the Spanish vocalist Amparo Sánchez reveals the song’s true destination. ¿Adónde vas? ""A bailer cumbia."" In this as in so many of Calexico’s songs, the characters can go anywhere and do anything. Perhaps it’s a quaint notion, but there is a certain freedom in rootlessness and restlessness. This idea has been Calexico’s guiding principle since Burns and drummer Jon Convertino split from Giant Sand in the early 1990s and lit out for parts unknown. They have never stood still for long, working as a backing band for Neko Case and Amos Lee while expanding their drums-and-guitar soundtrack rock into something larger, more song-driven, and more cinematic. If the band have skirted accusations of cultural appropriation, that’s mainly due to the important fact that they do not deploy world music as a means to exoticize American folk rock. Rather, these various strains form the framework of their band’s songs, all the way down to the lyrics themselves. It wasn’t until 2012’s Algiers that they began to sound creatively staid, as though they had reached the ends of their inspiration in Latin American music, but Edge of the Sun sounds newly invigorated and inspired as Calexico reconsider their own past and find new music to explore. Burns and Convertino have always surrounded themselves with an eclectic set of collaborators, and Edge of the Sun is filled with cameos, most of them lending their songs a distinctive sound. Case sounds like a mirage on ""Tapping on the Line"", and Ben Bridwell, on loan from Band of Horses, adds some 2000s indie-rock drama to opener ""Falling from the Sky"", making that central question resonate powerfully throughout the rest of the album: ""Where do you go when you have nowhere to go?"" With Sam Beam singing and playing guitar, ""Bullets & Rocks"" inevitably recalls their joint EP from 2005, In the Reins, only bolder and more resourceful as they set a Tinariwen guitar lick rolling through the Mojave. As usual, however, the most compelling contributions come from artists less familiar to American ears. For this reason, Calexico place them prominently in the music, often building whole songs around their voices or instruments. Sánchez is as much a presence on ""Cumbia de Donde"" as frontman Burns is, and members of the Greek band Tikam lend ""World Undone"" its suspense, creating the impression of an unraveling groove. Mexican singer Carla Morrison dominates the dark reggae bump of ""Moon Never Rises"", ghosting Burns’ vocals before distorting her own delivery to make that central theme sound unsettling, uprooted, unplaceable. (Curious listeners should check out her excellent 2012 album, Déjenme Llorar.) It’s tempting to praise Calexico simply for its globetrotting spirit, but corralling so many styles and sounds onto one album should not be an end in itself. Fortunately, the album’s musical diversity is a reflection of its lyrical themes. Named for a city that straddles Mexico and America, Calexico make music that is almost inevitably about borders both musical and national: finding them, crossing them, blurring them. Burns’ songwriting keeps that idea anchored in very personal and specific perspectives, which lends human proportions to the ambitiously cinematic arrangements. His characters are transient by circumstance, always striving for something better: a sense of security, a feeling of freedom, a place to dance without danger, sometimes just a dip in the ocean. That’s the one wish of the main character in ""Miles from the Sea"", a landlocked laborer beaten down by ""years of searing heat."" He ""dreams about swimming, miles away from the sea,"" Burns sings, his voice reaching deep to hit the low notes. The horns billow gently, the violin eddies wistfully, and Guatemalan singer Gaby Moreno draws those syllables out on the chorus to reinforce the sense of longing. The song fades in a roll of thunder, hinting that this dream of escape will go unrealized, but the music takes him and us right out among the waves.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20353-edge-of-the-sun/,"Anti-,City Slang",2015.0,"If you're a fan of alt-rock and haven't heard Calexico's ""Edge of the Sun"" yet, you're missing out on something special. This album delivers a unique blend of rock, country, and Latin styles that come together to create a truly immersive listening experience. 

Calexico has been around since the mid-90s, hailing from Tucson, Arizona. They've been building their reputation over the years for their unique musical style and strong songwriting abilities. ""Edge of the Sun"" is their ninth studio album, released in 2015, and it's a testament to their maturity as artists.

The album was recorded in Mexico City, and you can feel the influence of the setting on the music. The Latin-inspired rhythms weave in and out of the tracks effortlessly, creating a truly immersive experience that transports you to a different time and place. 

The album starts off strong with the upbeat and poppy ""Falling from the Sky,"" setting the tone for what's to come. The journey continues through tracks like ""Bullets and Rocks,"" a slow-burning ballad that builds into something larger than life, and ""Miles from the Sea,"" an uplifting melody that's nothing short of inspiring.

One of the highlights of the album is ""Cumbia de Donde,"" a track that embraces the band's Mexican influences with open arms. It features Mariachi-style brass, acoustic guitars, and a heavy percussion section that evokes images of a party in a small town in Mexico. Each instrument is given room to shine, and as a whole, it creates a rich and diverse musical landscape that's impossible to resist.

As someone who's listened to a lot of alt-rock, ""Edge of the Sun"" stands out as one of the most refreshing albums I've come across in recent years. The Latin-inspired rhythms and unique instrumentation provide a welcome break from the heavy guitar riffs and distorted vocals that dominate the genre. It's an album that's easy to get lost in, and by the time the final track, ""Follow the River,"" fades out, you feel like you've been on a journey.

In conclusion, ""Edge of the Sun"" is a fantastic album that's perfect for anyone who's looking for something a little bit different. It's clear that the band poured their hearts and souls into this record, and that shines through in every track. I'd highly recommend giving it a listen if you haven't already.","1.

MGMT,Congratulations,Rock,6.8,April 12 2010,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"If you're coming to the second MGMT album because you loved ""Time to Pretend"", ""Kids"", and ""Electric Feel"", there's the door. No such moments exist on Congratulations. Hell, there aren't even failed attempts at replicating those songs here. This time out, MGMT aren't crafting pop; they're Creating Art. The problem is that many of the half-million or so people who bought their debut, Oracular Spectacular, just want a couple catchy-as-fuck, ear-candy singles to blast in their cars or put on with their friends. One possible response to Congratulations is that MGMT are having a real ""time to pretend"" moment-- that they're willfully being weird, and either shrinking from the challenge of repeating their crossover success or clumsily aiming to prove their underground cred. But the simplest answer seems most realistic: MGMT are being themselves. Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden wrote and released ""Time to Pretend"" and ""Kids"" way back in 2005. With a major-label contract in hand, they've never again written anything so radio-friendly. Instead, they penned the headier and exploratory (and weaker) parts of their debut album with help from go-to bells-and-whistles guy Dave Fridmann. This led to songs called ""4th Dimensional Transition"" and ""Of Moons, Birds & Monsters"". Pastoral English pop, flighty mysticism, and studio-rat arrangements aren't the exception with this band, they're the rule. Now they've returned with an album full of that stuff, and the result is audacious, ambitious, and a little fried. Working with Spacemen 3's Sonic Boom, MGMT have crafted a grandiose but not always clear-eyed record. Instead of the commercial climbers they're lumped alongside (the Killers, Kings of Leon, Muse), MGMT follow the lead of the Flaming Lips and Beck and prove to be kindred spirits with Of Montreal, Yeasayer, and Klaxons. They're in love with 1970s art-rock, and they've immersed themselves in uncool subgenres like pop-psych and prog. And despite the lack of marquee songs, they've made, top to bottom, a more interesting and even better record this time out. If their success granted them the opportunity to do whatever they wanted, MGMT took advantage of it, layering songs with a surplus of ideas when a few good ones would have done. Every track here has successful passages, but frustratingly, they too often turn out to be detours or trap doors. In general, the less cluttered and more focused their tracks are, the better they turn out. The most satisfying songs are the ballads-- the title track in particular, but also ""I Found a Whistle""-- or the ones like ""It's Working"" and ""Someone's Missing"" that walk a fairly linear path. The most arduous is the 12-minute ""Siberian Breaks"", which has some intriguing elements but little discernible reason to be so densely constructed. Few bands this year will release a record under more difficult circumstances than MGMT, and following a shock commercial success with a zig when your fans want you to zag has always been dangerous. MGMT aren't hitting the self-destruct button here, but the best-case scenario is that a cult, happy to shed the carpetbagger fans of OS, are willing to follow these guys around from idea to idea. Some may even use them as an introduction to the bands they've namechecked-- Spacemen 3, Brian Eno, Television Personalities-- and the sounds from which they've drawn inspiration. The more likely, short-term result is that MGMT are reined in a bit, not given so much rope to hang themselves. But that they didn't hang themselves here, given the circumstances, suggests a certain amount of talent. Whether they write club-friendly songs like ""Kids"" or tracks like ""Congratulations"" or ""Flash Delirium"" or ""It's Working"", they can write songs. Hopefully, next time they won't try to jam two dozen of them onto a nine-track album.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/,Columbia,2010.0,"Congratulations by MGMT: An Empowering and Ambitious Experience

If there's one thing that can be said about MGMT's Congratulations, it's that it's a complex and ambitious album. While most of us know the band for their early hits, such as ""Kids"" and ""Electric Feel,"" Congratulations serves as a testament to the band's willingness to take risks.

First, let's talk about the band's history. Formed in 2002 by Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser while they were studying at Wesleyan University, MGMT quickly gained a reputation for their quirky electro-pop offerings. While they enjoyed a great deal of success with Oracular Spectacular, their debut album, they quickly found themselves grappling with the expectations of both fans and the music industry.

That brings us to Congratulations. Recorded largely in a cabin in upstate New York and inspired by the band's personal experiences and quest for artistic freedom, this album is unlike anything else that MGMT has created before. Simply put, Congratulations is an album that demands attention.

From the opening track ""It's Working"" to the final notes of ""Congratulations,"" you can hear the band's evolution. No longer content to stick to the formula that made them famous, MGMT has created a rock-focused album that incorporates a broad range of influences. The result is a set of songs that feel empowering and, at times, almost spiritual.

Personally, I have to admit that Congratulations took a few listens for me to fully appreciate it. However, once I dove into the album and let myself be fully immersed in the music, I found myself pleasantly surprised by what MGMT had created. Songs like ""Song for Dan Treacy"" and ""Brian Eno"" showcase the band's range and ability to create music that feels both personal and universal.

Still, Congratulations isn't a perfect album in my eyes. There are moments, such as on ""Lady Dada's Nightmare,"" where the band's desire to experiment with sound and structure feels a bit forced. However, I believe that the ambition and creativity of Congratulations more than make up for any missteps.

In conclusion, MGMT's Congratulations is an album that feels both daring and inspiring. While it may not be as immediately accessible as the band's earlier work, it's a sign that the group is unafraid to take creative chances and push themselves musically. I would highly recommend this album to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and engaging rock experience. With a rating of 6.8 out of 10, it may not be a perfect album for everyone, but it's certainly one that deserves attention and appreciation.","1.

Mark Lanegan & Duke Garwood,Black Pudding,,6.7,May 17 2013,Steven Hyden,Contributor,"In the 1980s and 90s, Mark Lanegan never seemed like he was going to be an old man. In the 21st century, however, it’s become nearly impossible to remember that Lanegan was ever young. In his review of Lanegan’s characteristically growly 2012 solo record Blues Funeral, Ian Cohen likened Lanegan to weathered classic-rockers like Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, and Leonard Cohen, and speculated that he “will be all but grandfathered into that Hall of Fame in 20 years.” But why wait another two decades when Lanegan already affects a spooky “chain-smoking walking corpse” persona as well as anybody? The first time Lanegan emerges on Black Pudding, his new collaboration with English multi-instrumentalist Duke Garwood (who most recently guested at the end of Savages' Silence Yourself), he’s addressing his frequent sparring partner Jesus C. in the bluesy prayer “Pentacostal”. On the next track, “War Memorial”, Lanegan points to “a pack of feral dogs” nipping at his heels, as he’s not one to choose sides between God and the Devil. “Don’t tell me the ending of the play/ Don’t make me look/ In the mirror,” he sings. We all know which undead creature generally avoids mirrors. Blues Funeral was Lanegan’s first solo record in eight years; for Black Pudding, he’s back to working with a musical co-pilot, which has been his preferred mode of working for the past decade. Like his partnerships with Isobel Campbell and Greg Dulli, Lanegan’s coupling with Garwood is somewhat vampiric in nature. While Garwood makes his presence felt throughout Black Pudding, most notably on the evocative bookending instrumentals “Black Pudding” and “Manchester Special” (which sound like a film score for an imaginary post-apocalyptic spaghetti western), he’s ultimately subsumed by Lanegan’s outsized personality. To his credit, Garwood seems to understand that this was probably inevitable and acts accordingly: His accompaniment on Black Pudding tends to be spare and unobtrusive, which keeps the spotlight on Lanegan, that monstrous croon, and his ongoing communion with the great beyond. While Black Pudding is more limited and monochromatic than Lanegan’s other pairings-- the beauty-and-the-beast lustiness of the Isobel Campbell records is obviously missing, as is the mile-deep veneer of filth and depravity from the Dulli-assisted Gutter Twins records-- it doesn’t necessarily suffer from it. Lanegan is a brand name that promises scarifying dirges and tough-guy sensitivity, and Black Pudding delivers on both accounts with workmanlike consistency. You can guess precisely what songs like “Death Rides a White Horse” or “Sphinx” sound like before playing them. If that makes Black Pudding a wheelhouse record, so be it; the Sly Stone-like downer funk of “Cold Molly” demonstrates that Lanegan falters whenever he ventures outside of his self-made pine box. Predictability isn’t the most exciting or virtuous artistic attribute, but at least Black Pudding is a luminous and finely crafted example of a well-established formula. Lanegan is a year-and-a-half away from his 50th birthday, but he already has the gravitas of 70s-era Clint Eastwood; Black Pudding might not be High Plains Drifter, but it’s a suitably entertaining bad-ass diversion a la The Gauntlet.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17869-mark-lanegan-duke-garwood-black-pudding/,Ipecac,2013.0,"Black Pudding - A Perfect Blend of Mark Lanegan & Duke Garwood

When two immensely talented musicians like Mark Lanegan and Duke Garwood put their heads together, you can expect nothing less than pure magic. That's exactly what their collaborative album 'Black Pudding' is - pure, unadulterated magic.

Before jumping into the details of this album, let's establish a little background about these two legends. Mark Lanegan, the former frontman of the Screaming Trees, has had a remarkable solo career since the early 90s. On the other hand, Duke Garwood is a multi-talented instrumentalist who has worked with a diverse range of artists including The Orb, Wooden Wand and Kurt Vile. They are both great talents in their own right, but together they are an unbeatable duo.

Talking about 'Black Pudding', you can instantly feel the bond between the two artists. The album opened with ""Pentacostal"" which perfectly sets the mood for the rest of the album. Mark's haunting and gritty vocals blend flawlessly with Duke's bluesy and psychedelic guitar sounds. ""Mescalito"" and ""Thank You"" are standout tracks, with Mark's voice soaring over Duke's otherworldly guitar riffs. ""Sphinx"" and ""Last Rung"" are two of the more introspective songs, showcasing the emotional range of their music.

The album's creatio story in itself is fascinating. The two artists met at a mutual friend's gig, and Duke suggested that the two of them should work together. They had a few writing sessions, and before long they had enough material to record an entire album. They went into the studio with the intention of creating something raw and organic, and that is exactly what they achieved. The stripped-back, bare-bones production makes it seem like you are sitting in the same room with them as they play.

I find this album personally captivating, and it's certainly one that will not leave my playlist anytime soon. The album's genre of nan is a new one for me, but it's clear that it's a perfect fit for this unique and haunting music. The only minor complaint I have is that the album does suffer from occasional drifts towards monotony, but this is outweighed by its overall excellence.

Overall, 'Black Pudding' is a fantastic collaboration between two distinct talents who have combined to create an unforgettable and emotive album. I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates great music.","1. Review A is longer than Review B.

On Wooden Ball, the latest in a rapid-fire series of releases from the pair, only five of the 16 tracks make it over the two-minute mark. Their insistence on recording to four-track tape adds to the small feeling, lending a compressed intimacy to their bursts of all-thumbs pop. A cliche (and a truth) often uttered about four-track recordings is that you ""feel like you're in the room there with them,"" which is something often ascribed to, say, Lou Barlow's work under his Sentridoh alias. It's not something shared by Blanche Blanche Blanche, who use the muffled textures to make themselves sound anesthetized from the world, lost somewhere in a land of their own creation. Wooden Ball ups that feeling tenfold from last year's Wink With Both Eyes, largely due to the greater complexity of Smith and Phillips' creations. If Wink was a little too enchanted with the cheap-speed world Ariel Pink created on his earliest releases, Wooden Ball has taken that template and tied a few more knots in it. The outcome has deposited Blanche Blanche Blanche somewhere close to the Ohio punk and New Wave scene that bloomed in the late 1970s, with specific cues taken from Devo's first couple of albums. There's a strong sense of the robo-rock approach of Mark Mothersbaugh's band, a great rush of synthesized movement that's impeccably ordered, yet splinters off at angles you rarely see coming around the bend. Like Devo, it's manic at first, even difficult to process. Smith and Phillips clearly get a kick out of setting up songs that come close to wilting under their own good ideas. ""TED Talks"" is their best example of this to date, drawing vital energy from the deranged motion of the track, which is perfectly balanced by Smith's dispassionate vocal. There's a confidence here that was only hinted at on Wink. Smith's singing often slows to a spoken-word pace, sometimes strains at the seams, and is regularly furnished with a brash kind of cool. It's like a cross between Ann Magnuson's work in Bongwater and Anna Waronker's supremely disengaged delivery in That Dog. Blanche Blanche Blanche's greatest material resembles an all-out cage match between the instrumentation and the vocals, full of roaming, mechanised basslines (""Time to Remember"", ""Cow""); wild machine noise lost in an upsurge of distortion (""Join the Creative Class""); and berserk 21st century vaudeville (""Looks Don't Run""). There's nothing that resembles relatively straight songs like ""That's Siberia"" and ""Appetite"" from Wink, and this record is better for it. Madness clearly suits them far better than sanity. One weakness is Smith and Phillips' tendency to flick through styles and present gone-wrong versions of them; ""The One I'll Call"" attempts warped reggae, ""The Kind Dry Stream"" is a demented piano ballad. Those tracks splice up the mood of the record, but they don't need to go there, especially now they've found a footing that's close to being their own. They haven't quite shed all the Ariel Pinkisms either, but they're almost gone, with that drowsy kind of melancholy increasingly at odds with everything else going on when it emerges. Whimsy can often be so hard to get right in music, but Wooden Ball becomes effortlessly palatable over time in the same way as odd releases like Renaldo & the Loaf's Songs for Swinging Larvae. Despite the constant barrage of music, there's a feeling that the people behind Blanche Blanche Blanche have put a lot of care into this work, striving hard to dislodge their brains from the well-travelled path.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17700-blanche-blanche-blanche-wooden-ball/,NNA Tapes,2013.0,"When I first heard that Blanche Blanche Blanche is releasing a new album named “Wooden Ball”, I was curious about how they would manage to surprise us with their latest creation. The band, known for its experimental approach and genre-defying soundscape, has always been a favorite of mine. So, my expectations were high. And I must say, the album did not disappoint.

Blanche Blanche Blanche consists of Sarah Smith and Zach Phillips, who are known for their eccentric and eclectic musical style. The duo has been creating music together since 2008, and their latest release “Wooden Ball” is a testament to their creativity and unique approach to music. The album revolves around the concept of childhood memories, and it is an exploration of the duo's personal experiences and emotions.

The opening track, “Horror Movie”, sets the tone for the album with its eerie and mysterious vibe. The song is haunting and atmospheric, with the sound of wind chimes and distorted vocals that give it an otherworldly feel. The next few tracks, “Anger Rises” and “Untitled”, capture the raw emotions of childhood with their chaotic and frantic sound.

As I continued listening, I found myself drawn to the track “Trying to Fly”. The song feels like a nostalgic journey, with its dreamy vocals and melodic guitar riffs. It's a peaceful interlude in the midst of the chaos, and for a few moments, I was lost in its simple beauty.

One of the standout tracks on the album is “It's Fine”, which features a catchy melody and a foot-tapping rhythm. The song is a departure from the band's usual sound, and it's a welcome change. It's a testament to the band's ability to experiment and try new things without losing their identity.

The album ends with the track “Wooden Ball”, which feels like a fitting conclusion to the album's theme. The song is eerie and unsettling, with its repetitive melody and distorted vocals that fade away into silence. It's a haunting melody that lingers long after the song is over.

In conclusion, “Wooden Ball” by Blanche Blanche Blanche is a testament to the duo's creative prowess and experimental approach to music. It's a nostalgic journey that captures the raw emotions of childhood memories, and it's an album that will stay with you long after you've listened to it. With a solid rating of 7.0 out of 10, this album is definitely worth a listen for anyone looking for something new and exciting.","1.

White Rabbits,Milk Famous,"Electronic,Rock",5.6,March 8 2012,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"A lot of things frustrate me about White Rabbits' third album, Milk Famous. First and foremost, the band's mistaking melodic and emotional obtuseness with alluring restraint. So I apologize for erring on the side of artless candor to express the single most obvious thing about them: They sound like Spoon. A lot like Spoon*.* Now, here's the major difference between White Rabbits and the hundreds of other bands of whom that's also true: They actually have Spoon's permission. Serving as producer on 2009's It's Frightening, Britt Daniel helped the Brooklyn-via-Columbia, Mo., sextet advance past the peppy dancehall-rock of Fort Nightly to become a streamlined and moody band that might find their prior enthusiasm somewhat embarrassing. And now on Milk Famous, they enlist Mike McCarthy (Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, Gimme Fiction) to produce, but rather than hearing a band use enviable mentoring to discover their own identity, there's something unnerving about how supplicant they are to this weird symbiotic relationship: White Rabbits get a crucial cosign, and Spoon ostensibly get a place to test drive studio tricks without worrying that their protégées will beat them at their own game. Sounding like Spoon is hardly a non-starter, and in fact, a lot of bands could still stand to learn a lot from them. But Milk Famous falters by creating an Uncanny Valley effect by adopting the most easily replicable aspects without maintaining any sort of human element or offering anything that's identifiable as their own. Lead single ""Heavy Metal"" is perhaps their most blatant attempt yet to lionize their benefactors' sound sculpture over their songwriting, as it exchanges the verve and insistent rhythms of previous openers ""Kid on My Shoulders"" and ""Percussion Gun"" (their two finest songs) for a sonic game of Concentration!: To where can you match those backmasked synths, starchy basslines, eerily dead drums and edge-of-falsetto vocals? Are they from ""Eddie's Ragga""? ""Paper Tiger""? ""Was It You""? All three?  Either way, without a single melodic idea of substance, it's all trimmings, a Thanksgiving dinner of stuffing and cranberry sauce. Which isn't to say White Rabbits have nothing at their disposal to distinguish themselves-- it's just they all get downplayed despite not being adverse to their new sonic goals in any way. It always bums me out to see a dual-percussionist setup underutilized, and while they give the drummers some shine with the showy polyrhythms of ""Everyone Can't Be Confused"" and ""Back For More"", they're mostly relegated to fill-free timekeeping and muffled funk. Likewise, Stephen Patterson has proven capable of leading ear-bending harmonies, which have been almost abandoned completely in favor of terse, disjointed phrases. Maybe it's all meant to reflect the communicative failures of brooding masculine figures, but it mostly ends up contributing to them as Milk Famous' lyrics sheet piles up clarifications, addendums, and corrections borne by self-reflexive cleverness (""It's nothing personal/ It's just that I'm not me”) and Yorke-ian magnetic poetry (""Don't tell me that it's all been sold/ The kitchen's on fire/ But you are self alone"") to sidestep what Patterson might actually mean. I can't help but acknowledge that Milk Famous sounds great because it really is all carefully protracted sound, confirming that ""highly produced"" isn't necessarily synonymous with ""overproduced."" If you set out listening to Milk Famous simply for its use of stereo spacing and post-production treatment, it's as satisfying a record as you'll hear in 2012, every normally acoustic instrument triggering so many extraneous textures, you'd think they secretly longed to be Disco Inferno. There's an intriguing tension at the outset of ""Danny Come Inside"", a stretched-thin vocal harmony sitting low against a hotly-mixed drum track, blunt riffs, and a sneaky hook, but all these interesting ideas just hang on, as the song itself is a four-minute jog to nowhere in particular. Likewise, all those neural bursts of guitar and patched-in drum flutters are perhaps intended as counterbalances to the austere lyricism and almost ambient use of melody, but it's a completely lopsided see-saw. In White Rabbits' defense, otherwise potentially solid MOR bands treating choruses and song structure as vestigial organs of less-evolved times is seemingly as reflective of indie rock in general as it is their own personal path. But ultimately, this is a band overestimating its ability to be interesting instead of likeable, misjudging the chasm between its ambitions and its talents. Or, yeah, they pretty much want to be Spoon too, but you'd think they'd remember who warned listeners to ""get free from the middleman.""",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16311-milk-famous/,"TBD,White Iris",2012.0,"If you are looking for a unique blend of electronic and rock music, then White Rabbits’ ‘Milk Famous’ album might just be the answer to your needs. Although not everyone's cup of tea, this album is a worthwhile listen that offers a refreshing take on the intersection of two musical genres. The album gets a 5.6 out of 10 rating, which may seem mediocre, but there is much more to it than a mere number can articulate.

Before diving into the music itself, it is important to understand the band's background and the story of how this album was created. White Rabbits were formed in 2004 in Columbia, Missouri, and are characterized by their experimental approach to music that features a dynamic range of styles and influences. ‘Milk Famous’ was released in 2012 and marked a departure from their preceding albums that were rooted in indie rock. Instead, this album incorporated more electronic sounds and dance beats, which added a new dimension to the band’s sound.

Upon listening to ‘Milk Famous', one can immediately get a sense of the eclectic range of sounds White Rabbits are capable of producing. The lead single ‘Heavy Metal’ is a perfect example of this. The song opens with a catchy and infectious drumbeat that gradually builds up to a chorus filled with frenzied guitar riffs and electronic glitches. And yet, despite the incorporation of all these different elements, the track feels cohesive and well-constructed.

One of the best tracks on the album is ‘Temporary’, which shines with its clever use of vocal harmonies. The song opens with a deceptively simple guitar riff that is soon joined by lilting falsetto vocals as the band builds towards an electrifying chorus. It’s a song that showcases the band's ability to craft a sound that is both complex and catchy.

While ‘Milk Famous’ is an enjoyable album overall, it does fall short in some areas. At times, the electronic elements can overpower the rock instrumentation, leading to an unbalanced sound. And some tracks tend to drag on for too long, leading to a sense of repetition that can become tedious. But these criticisms should not discourage you from giving this album a chance, as it is ultimately an intriguing and rewarding listening experience.

To conclude, White Rabbits’ ‘Milk Famous’ is a bold and daring album that puts an interesting spin on the traditional rock sound. It may not be perfect, but it is a fascinating journey into the depths of experimental rock and electronic music, and one that is well worth taking. So, if you are looking to broaden your musical horizons, give this album a listen and let your ears be amazed.","1.

The '89 Cubs,There Are Giants in the Earth,,7.3,January 13 2005,Brian Howe,Contributor,"This is something of a backhanded compliment (which is still better than a forehanded insult), but the '89 Cubs are better than you'd expect. A power trio comprised of members of Bright Eyes' backing band, Desaparecidos, and the Good Life, the latest export from ""Omaha's burgeoning music scene"" (to cop a perplexingly behind-the-curve quote from the band's press bio) hews closest to the fizzy, furious pop-punk of Desaparecidos. Many sophisticated listeners have already clicked the ""Back"" arrow on their browser at the first mention of pop-punk, the Disneyland of musical genres, but those who remain might be in for a pleasant surprise. While the '89 Cubs start with the predictable adrenaline boosts and anthemic dynamics of Desaparecidos, early Superchunk, Alkaline Trio, and the Get Up Kids, they leaven these shopworn chord changes with unusual yet intuitively sensible variations, lacing their songs with kinks, hiccups, spaz-outs, and atmospheric passages that constantly refresh their capacity to surprise and engage. I'd call it ""post-pop-punk,"" but I couldn't sleep nights if I were responsible for a new micro-genre in an already overly-specialized musical taxonomy; let's just call it aesthetically ambitious pop-punk with a strong predilection for shoegaze and sweeping, lyrical guitar passages. The opening track, the mini-epic ""Candid Flames"" begins with a longish instrumental segment before Ryan Fox's husky, even-keeled vocals commence, deftly shifting between the gliding expressivities of My Bloody Valentine and slashing, chugging riffs which seem to say: You'll get amped and like it. The wavering, cyclic intro of ""Sorry Tornado"" rolls into a classic 4/4 lead, then into a dense and explosive verse that eventually loops back to the simple melodic figure at its core. ""We Won the Party"" counterpoises syncopated, scorching rock swathed in dissonant feedback against the sort of succinct melodic packets to be found on a Thermals record. For fans of pop-punk, or emo-punk, or however you choose to perceive it, There Are Giants in the Earth could be the sleeper hit of the year (well, of last year-- thanks for bearing with us as we sweep the last dying embers from 2004's cooling hearth). Those of you who usually turn up your noses at such stuff (myself admittedly included) might find it to be a humbling, somewhat furtive pleasure-- with enough intellectual grist to justify playing it in public, but not enough to obscure the sheer exuberance at its core, the '89 Cubs temporarily rejuvenate those dormant mental channels that course with blissful, uncomplicated anima, the ones you felt certain you'd outgrown.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2918-there-are-giants-in-the-earth/,Slowdance,2004.0,"Welcome to my review of ""There Are Giants in the Earth,"" the latest offering from the esteemed band, The '89 Cubs. As a fan of their music for several years, I have eagerly awaited their latest release with bated breath. After a few listens, I can honestly say that this album is another exceptional addition to the band's already impressive discography.

For those who may not know, The '89 Cubs are a band with a rich history that dates back over two decades. They are known for their unique sound that blends elements of nan with rock and jazz. With consistently strong releases over the years, many consider The '89 Cubs to be one of the most influential nan bands of all time.

On this album, the band has created something truly special. From the opening track, ""No More Mountains to Climb,"" it's clear that The '89 Cubs are in top form. The intricate guitar work and driving drum beats keep the listener engaged throughout the entirety of the track. The highlight of the album for me, however, is the penultimate track, ""Echoes of the Past."" It's a beautiful, melancholic ode to nostalgia that stands out as one of the band's finest compositions to date.

The album's creation story is fascinating as well. The band spent months writing and rehearsing the songs before heading into the studio to record. With renowned producer, Rick Rubin at the helm, the band was able to bring their vision to life in a way that is both cohesive and innovative. The production quality on this album is second to none, with each instrument and vocal track finely tuned to perfection.

But perhaps what's most impressive about ""There Are Giants in the Earth"" is how it showcases the evolution of The '89 Cubs' sound. While still undoubtedly nan, this album pushes the boundaries of the genre in exciting new ways. Tracks like ""Infinite Possibilities"" and ""The Ripple Effect"" experiment with different tempos and time signatures, creating an almost hypnotic effect that draws the listener deeper into the music.

In conclusion, ""There Are Giants in the Earth"" is another triumph for The '89 Cubs. It's a remarkable album that showcases the band's exceptional musicianship and innovative approach to music-making. If you're a fan of nan, rock, or jazz, or just appreciate good music in general, then don't hesitate to give this album a listen. I rate it a solid 9.0 out of 10.","Step 1: Look for any unnatural or repetitive language. Review A uses phrases like ""perplexingly behind-the-curve quote"" and ""the ones you felt certain you'd outgrown"", which sound more like language generated by a model. Review B, on the other hand, does not contain any such language and reads smoothly throughout.

Step 2: Look for references to personal experiences or opinions. Review A mentions ""sophisticated listeners"" and ""those of you who usually turn up your noses at such stuff"", whereas Review B focuses only on the music and the band. This suggests that Review A may be written by someone attempting to insert their own opinions and knowledge into the review, while Review B is written more objectively.

Step 3: Analyze the level of detail in the review. Review A provides a track-by-track breakdown of the album and describes the elements of each song that stand out, whereas Review B takes a more general approach and describes the album as a whole. This suggests that Review A may be written by someone who is attempting to be more thorough or comprehensive, while Review B is written more for someone who wants an overview of the album.

Nickel Eye,The Time of the Assassins,Rock,5.2,February 4 2009,Joshua Klein,,"When the Strokes debuted, the group was often treated like a gang, a throwback to the all-for-one glory days of punk. Yet as the band stuck around that bond of brotherhood seemed to weaken, eventually turning into an ongoing hiatus. Inevitably, band memebers peeled off and formed side projects: First came Albert Hammond Jr.'s solo career; next came Little Joy (featuring Fabrizio Moretti); now here's Nickel Eye, led by bassist Nikolai (get it?) Fraiture. Fraiture recently went on record hinting the Strokes were ready to head back into the studio, which, if you believe him, only further emphasizes Nickel Eye's side-project status, if not diminishes expectations outright for Nickel Eye's debut The Time of the Assassins. The disc hasn't exactly been pressing on Fraiture-- he only dove into the project when the Strokes hiatus stretched on longer than expected. Yet Fraiture has also claimed inspiration for the disc stems from a road trip he took when he was 19. Fraiture is now 30. That's one long incubation. Well, maybe it was the lack of pressure and the entirely casual nature of Nickel Eye, but Time of the Assassins actually turned out OK. Recorded with some help called up from Fraiture's Rolodex roster, including Regina Spektor, Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner, and members of the London outfit South, Time provides 35 minutes of disaffected, country-inflected post-punk, rock that comes close enough to the Strokes that people might recognize the family resemblance but not so close that anyone would confuse this for a carbon copy. The most immediate difference between Time of the Assassins and the output of Fraiture's main gig is the generally acoustic approach of the disc, not in the coffee house sense but in its shuffling, laid-back vibe. Even when the rhythms bounce off one another in tight, tricky lockstep, songs such as ""You and Everyone Else"", ""Back From Exile"", and the ska-tinged ""Brandy of the Damned"" are in fact willfully mellow. Fraiture dampens things down even further on tracks like ""Where the Cold Wind Blows"", ""Fountain Avenue"", and the whistle-led ""This is the End""-- cowboy songs for people walking concrete streets. On ""Another Sunny Afternoon"", Fraiture even dusts off the harmonica. Alas, the disc would have been better off had Fraiture stuck to the harp, since as a singer he's a heck of bassist. Each track bathes Fraiture's nasally vocals beneath a ton of echo at odds with the otherwise dry recording, but the self-conscious disguise still isn't enough to hide his modest abilities. As if to emphasize his inadequacies, the album's final track is a cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye""-- it's lovely, but in comparison even Cohen's famously limited voice makes more of an impression than Fraiture's own distracted mumble. Time of the Assassins could have used a few more trips to the Rolodex to bring in a ringer of a singer or two, since Fraiture doesn't seem up to the task, or necessarily even into it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12639-the-time-of-the-assassins/,Ryko,2009.0,"When it comes to rock music, Nickel Eye's ""The Time of the Assassins"" has an interesting position. It's rated at 5.2 out of 10, which can automatically make some people skeptical. However, upon listening to the album, I found that it deserved more accolades than it received.

Let's start with the band's history. Nickel Eye is a side project of The Strokes' bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and ""The Time of the Assassins"" is their first release. When I first heard this fact, I was excited to hear what Fraiture had to offer on his own. Thankfully, the album did not disappoint.

The creation story of the album is also an interesting one. According to Fraiture, the album was created while he was on tour with The Strokes. He had his laptop and a small recording device with him and used whatever time he had between shows and soundchecks to work on the songs for ""The Time of the Assassins."" This unconventional creation process results in a unique album that has its own personality.

Now, let's get into the music itself. The album has a distinctive rock sound that reflects the genre's classic roots. The opening track, ""Intro,"" is reminiscent of 70s-era rock songs with its guitar riff and drums. The following track, ""Brandy of the Damned,"" is what immediately caught my attention. The way Fraiture's voice meshes with the song's guitar and drums is seamless. The song has an infectious energy to it that perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the album.

As for personal experience and opinions, I must admit that I enjoyed the album as a whole. Yes, there are moments where the songs do blend together, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The consistency of the album's sound is a testament to Fraiture's creative vision. In particular, ""Back From Exile"" and ""Fountain Avenue"" are standout tracks for me. They deliver on the rock sound that the album promises while also providing a unique listening experience.

In conclusion, ""The Time of the Assassins"" by Nickel Eye deserves more attention than it initially received. Fraiture's side project offers a classic rock sound that's grounded in the roots of the genre, while also delivering a unique listening experience. Although it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate rock music should give it a chance. I know I'm glad I did.","1.

Grapetooth,Grapetooth,Rock,5.9,November 21 2018,Steven Arroyo,Contributor,"No other band on the planet may be having more fun right now than Grapetooth, the duo of Twin Peaks guitarist Clay Frankel and producer Chris Bailoni, or Home-Sick. During the last year, the Chicago synth-pop goofs have waved katanas out of convertibles, misused a moped, and played sold-out shows that often resemble stampedes and sometimes involve haircuts. But you know what’s not so fun? Scrapping a bad song idea, making a good song even better, or questioning what songs are strong enough for a livewire concert but may not work so well on an album. Grapetooth’s ostensible reluctance to do just that means that their self-titled debut for Polyvinyl is actually not so fun to hear. In Twin Peaks, Frankel helps push rowdy rock into overdrive, even one-upping his bandmates’ unhinged energy. In Grapetooth, his slightly sawtoothed voice scuffs and scrapes the warped but smooth synthesizer bop of Bailoni, who sings some here, too. Synth-and-mic duos have been using small setups to convey big feelings for years, of course, from their proclaimed inspirators Suicide to the epiphany sculptors of Majical Cloudz. But Grapetooth—the band’s term for someone who drinks a lot of wine—are the Two-Buck Chuck version of the more sophisticated stuff. They trade in cheap fun, not deep reflection. They try on ill-fitting vocal styles like wacky hats, as when they drawl together on the kazoo’d-up campfire closer “Together” or try to steal back Len’s sunshine on “Trouble.” Grapetooth’s low-effort operation is part and parcel of their overall charm, but effortlessness doesn’t have to mean insincerity. During these 10 tracks, those feelings often seem inseparable. When Grapetooth fully inhabit their happy-drunk energy to sell a gigantic proclamation like, “They will come for us one day/I will fight them off for you,” as they do during “Violent,” it works, because it seems to come with a Future Islands-sized sense of conviction. With its cascading synths and stacked harmonies, the music here is better built than the Cheez Whiz construction of “Trouble” or the lazy Depeche Mode imitation “Death.” They start promisingly with their sweetest groove on “Hangover Sq.,” shaping a Smiths-like foundation with a high bassline and breezy hi-hats. They even ditch their two-man method, adding a rhythm section. But they barely bother writing lyrics, instead singing the words to “Why So Pale and Wan Fond Lover?” by the 17th-century English poet John Suckling and adding a ridiculous kicker about going “down to hangover square.” They keep their words brief, as if trying to hide the fact that they’re short on compelling ideas and honest effort. Grapetooth are masters of their own wine-fueled zone—a place where all that matters is polishing off a cheap bottle or two, turning down the lights, firing up the keyboards, hitting ‘Record,’ and going for broke on the first melody and words that happen. Join them in person, and Grapetooth the band will take you to that space and time. But as an album, Grapetooth feels like pressing ‘Play’ on those same recordings the morning after and realizing that maybe it all wasn’t quite as fun as you thought last night.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/grapetooth-grapetooth/,Polyvinyl,2018.0,"The debut self-titled album from Grapetooth is a curious blend of rock, new wave and pop that promises to captivate anyone with an adventurous ear. If this sounds like your thing, read on, because this review is for you.

Grapetooth is a band born out of a partnership between Clay Frankel and Chris Bailoni, two Chicago-based musician friends. They started making music for fun, never intending to become a ""serious"" band. But soon they found themselves creating a sound that was too good not to share with the world.

The resulting album is a 10 track journey through the minds of two musicians who love to experiment. The opening track, ""Violent"" hits you with its jagged guitar riffs and pulsating drumbeat, establishing the album's restless energy from the get-go. ""Trouble"" and ""Milemarker"" follow, showcasing Grapetooth's love for sonic layering and synth-heavy melodies.

Perhaps what sets Grapetooth apart from other rock bands is their penchant for pop sensibilities. Tracks like ""Red Wine"" and ""Hallelujah"" are fun and catchy, each with their upbeat tempo and singalong choruses. Yet, they never feel cheap or gimmicky. Even when the band indulges in the occasional cheesy keyboard riff (as on ""Blood""), they manage to do so with a wink and a nod that somehow elevates it beyond its surface-level appeal.

With that said, Grapetooth's debut is not without its flaws. At times, the songs can feel a little underdeveloped, like there are bits missing that could have made them truly great. At other times, the vocals can be too low in the mix, making it hard to decipher what Frankel and Bailoni are singing about.

Despite these minor issues, Grapetooth is a solid debut from a band that has tons of potential. It's clear that this album was created with a lot of love and a desire to create something unique. The result is an album that is truly its own thing, blending different genres and styles into one cohesive whole.

Overall, Grapetooth is a fun, energetic album that's worth checking out. If you're a fan of rock, new wave or pop, there's something here for you. With a rating of 5.9 out of 10, Grapetooth has room to grow, but don't be surprised if they become one of your new favorite bands.","1.

Hush Arbors,Landscape of Bone,"Experimental,Rock",7.4,July 26 2006,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"Hush Arbors is the work of the enigmatic, Virginia-born Keith Wood, a man whose restless travels have led to loose associations with such premier underground outfits as Sunburned Hand of the Man, Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice, and Six Organs of Admittance. On recent recordings each of those form-shifting acts can be heard nudging away from more definable acid-folk territories, so it seems only reasonable that artists like Wood should be standing ready to move in and tend the mystic fires in their absence. Following a pair of releases on Digitalis as well as the usual crop of handmade CD-Rs, the five-song Landscape of Bone now appears as part of Three Lobed's intriguing new Modern Containment series, and it again provides instant transport to Hush Arbor's singular lost domain. The most prominent distinguishing feature of Hush Arbors' music is Wood's gentle, slightly dazed falsetto. His fragile vocal delivery-- which here seems generated somewhere northward from Neil Young or Pearls Before Swine's Tom Rapp-- can lend even his most straightforward material a strange, asymmetric wobble. This vague discombobulation is further heightened by Hush Arbors' gauzy, outstretched fields of phased guitars, hand percussion, and unmoored drones-- all recorded with a lo-fi naturalism that recalls the open-aired environments of Jewelled Antler Collective acts like Skygreen Leopards or Blithe Sons. True to the album's title, each song on Landscape of Bone works the word ""bone"" somewhere into its lyrics-- ""Broken Bones"", ""Oar of Bone""-- as Wood dreamily sifts through the tangled knots of memory and regret. Despite this mini-album's brevity, he makes use of his limited space to consider a full spectrum of emotional terrain. His blurred enunciation sometimes makes his words indecipherable, but the opening ""Bones of a Thousand Suns"" has a distinct elegiac quality, its mournful liturgy framed by deep-earth hums and soft coils of fuzz guitar. Adorned with subtle slide guitar work, ""Broken Bones"" could almost pass for a particularly fried Townes Van Zandt creation, filled as it is with empty whiskey bottles and lost-love despondence (""I've died and I've died and I've died some more."") Soon, however, the album's mood reverses on the spirited ""Bones By the Sea"" which matches Wood's ecstatic garble to a melodic, tradition-steeped Appalachian folk cadence. Wooden Wand himself (aka James Toth) makes a cameo appearance on the dazzling ""Nine Bones"", a grainy 10-minute recessional that closes this short collection with a heady blast of free-rock drumming and barely-harnessed electricity. Like his friend and sometime collaborator Ben Chasny-- who last year also contributed liner notes to Hush Arbors' self-titled album-- Keith Wood here shows the ability to take the barest ingredients of folk and psych-rock traditions and transmute them into his own unique form of sorcery. Three Lobed have already announced that future installments of their Modern Containment series will feature EPs from the likes of Bardo Pond, MV & EE, Mirror/Dash and Sun City Girls, so hopefully this engaging Landscape of Bone might also serve as a harbinger of further treats to come.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9218-landscape-of-bone/,Three Lobed,2006.0,"When it comes to experimental rock, Hush Arbors is a name that cannot be ignored. This Virginia-based band has been a part of the underground music scene for over a decade, and their latest album 'Landscape of Bone' is a testament to their creative prowess. Released in 2019, this album is a synthesis of the band's years of experience and evolution.

To truly appreciate 'Landscape of Bone', it's important to understand the band's history. Formed by Keith Wood in 2001, Hush Arbors started out as a solo project before evolving into a full-fledged band. Over the years, the band members have changed, but Wood has remained the constant force behind their music. With his unique blend of folk, psychedelic, and experimental sounds, Hush Arbors has created a niche for themselves in the world of indie rock.

The creation story of 'Landscape of Bone' is also an interesting one. According to Wood, the album was ""born out of a feeling of desolation"". He wanted to explore themes of isolation, existentialism, and loss - all of which are palpable in the album's sound. Recorded in Wood's home studio, the album features a raw, stripped-down sound that captures the essence of the band's live performances.

From the first notes of the opening track ""Bother"" to the final chords of ""Shaken"", 'Landscape of Bone' is a musical journey that takes the listener through a range of emotions. The songs are driven by Wood's haunting vocals, which are complemented by the band's masterful instrumentation. Tracks like ""Gone"", ""Yankee Reality"", and ""Bowen Island Blues"" showcase the band's experimental side, with distorted riffs and unconventional time signatures. Other tracks, like ""Out of Time"" and ""Charm"", have a more laidback, introspective vibe.

As someone who has followed Hush Arbors' music for years, I can say that 'Landscape of Bone' is one of their strongest releases. It's an album that requires multiple listens to fully appreciate - there are so many layers and nuances to the music that reveal themselves with repeated listens. While it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate experimental rock and emotive lyrics will find a lot to love in this album.

Overall, I would give 'Landscape of Bone' a rating of 8.5 out of 10. It's a testament to Hush Arbors' creative vision and their ability to push the boundaries of rock music.","1.

Sunn O))),Kannon,"Experimental,Metal",6.5,December 3 2015,Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,"In 2008, Sunn O))) played a short series of duo concerts meant to acknowledge the band's modest, mimetic origins. Sunn O))) began as a tribute of sorts to Earth, the influential duo whose low, slow riffs and steadfast amplifier worship established the doom-metal mold that Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley were trying to fill anew. And for the first few years, that was the limit of the pair's output—lumbering riffs, played at a near-tectonic pace and deliriously high volumes. During the next half-decade, however, Anderson and O'Malley evolved. They incorporated a constellation of metal, noise and experimental guests into a series of high-concept records—White1, White2, and Black One, each of which expanded the pair's personnel and possibilities.They staged high-profile, full-length collaborations with counterparts and heroes. They turned concerts in clubs and cathedrals alike into frame-shattering, wall-shaking temporary installations, where robes, fogs, and a shrine of their namesake amplifiers shaped a sort of heavy-metal happening. More than a 10-year anniversary, those 2008 shows represented chances to jettison the excess and prove that the anchoring idea—chords played so long and loud the listener heard every overtone and felt every subtle change—remained potent. The new art-metal masters wanted to show they could still get back to basics. A year after those concerts, Sunn O))) issued Monoliths & Dimensions, an aptly named colossus that folded a horn section, a choir, a string section, a blown conch shell and black metal legend Attila Csihar speaking slowly into four pieces that were just ridiculous and divergent enough to work. In the years since, collaborations with Ulver and Scott Walker have also pushed Anderson and O’Malley farther beyond the early, atavistic comforts of Earth. Kannon is the first complete Sunn O))) since Monoliths & Dimensions, and it likewise documents a return to the elements for Anderson and O'Malley. Cut with a cast of familiar collaborators playing mere support roles to Anderson, O'Malley, and their amplifiers, Kannon reneges on that progression with a triptych of elegant yet underwhelming arcs and drones. It is typically loud. It is often pretty. It is, cumulatively, the first minor full-length studio album of Sunn O)))'s career. There are, no doubt, many beautiful and bracing passages throughout Kannon. Few musicians can summon the same mix of patience, intensity, roar, and meticulousness as Anderson and O'Malley; it's wonderful to hear them interact in the pristine, refined acoustic setting offered by producer Randall Dunn. Near the midsection of ""Kannon 1"", the bass, guitar, Csihar's obscured voice, and a capillary of feedback lock into a perfect unison. Even delivered through headphones, the sound is somehow paralyzing and exhilarating, as though a team of masseurs has just found all the right pressure points. The playing is so careful and the recording so crisp that, during ""Kannon 3"", you can listen to chords and notes arrive one by one and track their slow disappearance into the din around them. It's like watching time-lapse footage of solitary raindrops forming a deep puddle. But where Kannon exceeds as a collection of moments, it fails as both an album and an experience, especially given the general Sunn O))) scale. Brevity may be the only truly new idea the band incorporates here, as these three tracks just break the 33-minute mark. But Anderson and O'Malley don't seem to have squeezed the normal complications and layers into a tighter space so much as omitted them altogether. ""Kannon 1"" slowly gathers its riffs, pulling back the stage curtains for the subterranean rattle of an oddly subdued Csihar. ""Kannon 2"" begins with a wrestling match with a guitar that resolves in feedback and, again, introduces a familiar choir of incantatory voices, all surrounded by a wispy veil of electronic oscillations. The album's most unexpected instant actually comes at that song's end, when one massive, static bass note hangs still in the air. Percussion jostles beneath it, as though the enormous tone were rattling a household cupboard. Rather than explore the strange sound, Sunn O))) simply shut down the amps and discard it. And that's the problem, really: Kannon feels underdeveloped and rushed, like the start of a project that's been delivered prematurely. Since the release of Monoliths & Dimensions, Anderson and O'Malley have taken very separate paths. Anderson has re-launched the blues'n'doom outfit Goatsnake and retooled his label, Southern Lord, for old-school hardcore, crusty metal, and crossover fare. O'Malley, on the other hand, started an improvisational band with Keiji Haino and Oren Ambarchi, scored a film, composed for an orchestra, performed a new Alvin Lucier work, and launched a label devoted to such interests. That tension has long been an animating, thrilling force for Sunn O))). On Kannon, though, Anderson and O'Malley have opted to avoid rather than embrace it, to find a middle ground of compromise that steers safely away from the frisson of conflict. At least they sound good doing it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21286-kannon/,Southern Lord,2015.0,"Sunn O)))'s Kannon: An Experimental Journey with Eerie Undertones

As I immersed myself in the experimental-metal sounds of Sunn O)))'s Kannon, I couldn't help but think about the band's history and their reputation for pushing boundaries in the music industry. Known for manipulating and distorting sound in unconventional ways, Sunn O))) has made a name for themselves as one of the most innovative and enigmatic metal bands of all time.

With Kannon, Sunn O))) continues their legacy of defying convention and taking their listeners on a journey into the unknown. The album is inspired by one of the most important figures in Buddhism, Kannon, the goddess of mercy. It explores the concept of existence through the lens of this ancient deity, with each track delving deeper into the nuances of the Buddhist tradition.

While some may find the album unsettling, I was thoroughly entranced by the eerie soundscape that Sunn O))) created. The deep, guttural vocals blend seamlessly with the experimental instrumentation, and the result is a haunting and mesmerizing listening experience.

What I found particularly fascinating about Kannon is how the album can shift between moments of intense chaos and absolute stillness. The opening track, ""Kannon 1,"" begins with a gentle hum that slowly builds in intensity until it erupts into an explosion of sound. Similarly, ""Kannon 3"" is a slow, plodding track that creates a feeling of dread and unease through its use of minimalistic instrumentation.

Despite my appreciation for the band's experimentation, I do believe that some of the tracks on Kannon can feel repetitive and tedious. ""Kannon 2,"" in particular, is a track that feels like it goes on for far too long. However, the band's willingness to take risks and push boundaries ultimately makes up for these moments of monotony.

In conclusion, Sunn O)))'s Kannon is a unique and daring album that is not for the faint of heart. It is an experiment in sound that invites the listener to explore unfamiliar terrain and to embrace the unknown. While it may be polarizing for some, I believe that it is an essential addition to any music lover's collection, especially those interested in the experimental-metal genre. I would give this album a rating of 6.5 out of 10.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed, providing a lot of background information about the band Sunn O))) and its members.

Morrissey,Kill Uncle,Rock,6.0,April 12 2013,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"Morrissey Is Not a Human Being, Part Two. The former Smiths frontman, whose health concerns and vociferous animal-rights adovocacy have recently made him to the indie blogosphere what Lil Wayne is to TMZ, could've preempted the ailing rapper's latest album title way back in 1991. Moz had already shown devotees he was, well, human after all, when a planned follow-up to masterful 1988 solo debut Viva Hate fell apart amid professional acrimony and critical rubbishing. Then, after bouncing back brilliantly with 1990's Bona Drag singles compilation, Steven Patrick Morrissey followed through on what he'd been saying all along: That he had no right to take his place with the human race. Kill Uncle, Morrissey's second solo LP, has a largely deserved reputation as his least distinctive. A minor album by a major artist, it still offers its own curious pleasures, particularly for the converted (who have always constituted much of Moz's audience anyway). And like another wrongly panned outing by a canonical rock figurehead, Bob Dylan's Self Portrait in 1970, Kill Uncle positively revels in its own insubstantiality: Though often critiqued according to an indie tradition grounded in authenticity and personal expression, the album is best appreciated as a campy celebration of the decorative and artificial. The original vinyl includes an etching that reads, punning on Oscar Wilde, ""Nothing to declare except my jeans""; a standalone single coinciding with the reissue is a 7"" vinyl Rickroll. Morrissey might've had little choice but to wrap himself in arch humor. Where Viva Hate reunited him with the Smiths' producer Stephen Street and found a top-notch replacement for guitarist Johnny Marr in the Durutti Column's Vini Reilly, Kill Uncle's style varies between generically Smiths-y jangle and cabaret-like theatricality. Moz's production team here of Alan Winstanley and Clive Langer had a fairly solid track record (Elvis Costello, Madness; later, Bush's Sixteen Stone), and they'd actually overseen a few of Bona Drag's lesser cuts. But together with guitarist and Kirsty MacColl collaborator Mark E. Nevin, they failed to give Morrissey a musical setting as singular as his own eccentric presence. With the heavy lifting left to Morrissey's idiosyncratic lyrics and motley croon, he disappeared into them, tartly disowning such supposed virtues as honesty and passion. The best tracks tend to be the most bitterly funny, such as buoyant alt-pop opener ""Our Frank"", where a wryly ""r""-rolling Moz bemoans earnestness as so much vulgarity (""I'm only human,"" he sneers!), only to wind up suggesting his narrator is probably just targeting himself. ""Sing Your Life"", jaunty as the angle of a stylish cap, is a brutal ethering of the troubador-like idea expressed in its title, and contains another surprise ending: Just when it looks like Moz is about to pull back the curtain and reveal ""the truth,"" it turns out to be only that ""you have a lovely singing voice."" If the Smiths lyric from the The Queen Is Dead's ""Cemetry Gates"" about how ""Keats and Yeats are on your side/ While Wilde is on mine"" was misunderstood in 1986, Moz was beating the world over the head with it in 1991. And the world still wouldn't listen. The more ostensibly serious songs also mock conventional values, both aesthetically and morally. Much as other tracks here spurn the goal of expressing some timeless artistic truth, ""(I'm) The End of the Family Line""-- an elegantly swaying strummer so ""elegantly swaying"" you can almost hear the air quotes-- finds Morrissey rejecting the biological imperative of passing along his DNA. The family line might be ending, but the song doesn't right away: Just when a muffled speaking voice sounds like it's about to overtake the fading music, Moz comes back for another chorus, spitting his dynastic betrayal in the face of decent-thinking humanity one last time. Similarly, shutter-clicking whirligig ""The Harsh Truth of the Camera Eye"" plays less like a straightforward tale of paparazzi and more like a bleak observation on public image. Both are funnier than their pomp and circumstance might hint. Just think: Moz is mocked for his self-aggrandizement, but it's the breeders who act like we're so special the planet needs our genetic material after we die. Of course, compared with ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"" or even ""The First of the Gang to Die"", these sardonic jibes are lesser accomplishments, and not everything on Kill Uncle bears revisiting. The racially trolling ""Asian Rut""-- part of a regrettable triptych with Viva Hate's ""Bengali in Platforms"" and ""The National Front Disco,"" from 1992's far-superior Your Arsenal-- is instrumentally lavish, with accordion and violin, but it carries the album's undercurrent of dehumanization to an unbearable extreme: Morrissey withholds empathy for the victim of a racist attack. Though glorification of thuggish ugliness is a legitimate artistic theme that runs across the work of the writer Jean Genet and director Pier Paolo Pasolini, among many others, the result is frustrating from an artist with an unusually diverse indie-rock fanbase. Like last year's Viva Hate reissue, the newly remastered Kill Uncle package is only slightly different from its original, and not exactly for the better. ""Asian Rut"" is blessedly lower on the track list, ""Family Line"" assumes its rightful place at the end, and two superfluous B-sides now interrupt the album's midsection: ""Pashernate Love"", a romp too trifling even to succeed as a trifle, and ""East West"", a confounding Herman's Hermits cover that makes sense only as a nod to the album's superficiality (Moz exults, ""Nothing is tacky!""). The redone album artwork likewise emphasizes self-awareness, with photography of Moz posing in a Bona Drag T-shirt, but isn't especially arresting. No extra liner notes. No bonus discs. Nothing that might boost the rating above. The most noteworthy switch is the replacement of ""There's a Place in Hell for Me and My Friends,"" originally a piano-based torch song, with a live-in-studio version from 1991's Morrissey at KROQ EP. This take's muscular, rockabilly-infused glam-rock portends the direction Morrissey would take next on Your Arsenal. But perversely removing the most over-the-top, showtunes-y number from Kill Uncle only further undercuts the coherence of its appeal. And what about ""Sing Your Life"", which also appears in a more immediately pleasing but less conceptually appropriate rockabilly version on the KROQ EP? Now, as ever, provoking and then withholding sensible answers to such obsessive questions remains essential to Morrissey's allure. Kill Uncle came at a time when U.S. audiences, on the eve of Nirvana's breakthrough, might've decided Moz was another alternative-rock icon worthy of widespread embrace, but his decidedly English quirks were almost as out of step in the states as they were in the UK, where his native Manchester had gone (to him, deplorably) Madchester and Britpop was still a couple of years away. Morrissey always knew how to toy with the press; when he came out onstage in London's Finsbury Park draped in the Union Jack, it was a scandal. Before too long, it might've been Cool Britannia, but the irony would've been lost either way: Contrary to Deerhunter's wildly entertaining dismissal of Morrissey in a recent interview, he's no ""Sir Morrissey"" and has harshly criticized other rock musicians who accept royal honors. For a sense of just how misunderstood Kill Uncle was, consider that Rolling Stone's review at the time compared Morrissey's role with the Smiths to Sylvia Plath and chided the new record for its ""detached feel."" Surely, Plath is over on Keats' and Yeats' side. Meanwhile, over with Moz on Wilde's, detachment isn't necessarily an insult; that doesn't make the record a masterpiece, but it does make it one worth revisiting for Moz's ample cult. In a strange way, the song that best explains Kill Uncle isn't on Kill Uncle at all. It's Bona Drag's ""Disappointed"", where Morrissey sings, and a crowd responds, ""This the last song I'll ever sing (yeah!)/ No: I've changed my mind again (awww...)/ Good night, and thank you."" Morrissey fandom is a lifelong exercise in self-aware disappointment, but if he really is the last of his kind, let's enjoy him while we have him. Though he's been teasing us about his looming mortality for years, he really is all too human. And he has a lovely singing voice.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17837-morrissey-kill-uncle/,"Parlophone,Parlophone",1991.0,"Kill Uncle - The Underappreciated Morrissey Album That You Need to Listen To

Let's dive into a musical voyage, shall we? As a true Morrissey fan, I've listened to every album of his and pleasantly found that there is no end when it comes to his lyrical and musical finesse. Even though it's been over 20 years since the release of ""Kill Uncle,"" the album is still relevant and refreshing to listen to, especially for those who are new to Morrissey's music.

Morrissey is an artist who has created a name for himself with his relatable lyrical content and unique vocal delivery skills, which is why listeners have a cultivated level of expectations when they listen to 'Morrissey.' He speaks to the desolation and angst that are characteristic of everyday life, and his music has a powerful way of capturing those feelings and thoughts that we can all relate to.

""Kill Uncle"" was Morrissey's second solo effort, which was released in 1991. The album lacked the popularity the artist's meteoric rise was expected to generate; both among fans and critics alike. This album never received the acknowledgment it deserved, as it was overlooked due to the release of iconic albums such as ""Viva Hate"" in 1988 and ""Your Arsenal"" in 1992.

The album boasts a unique musical style, which is a blend of rock, alternative, and even theatrical delivery. The album's diversity of music was paired with Morrissey's signature humor and biting commentary on different social issues – ranging from animal rights advocacy to romance – it never gets boring.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Ouija Board, Ouija Board,"" which features a dark and eerily melodic intro that elevates as Morrissey sings about trying to communicate with the dearly departed. ""Our Frank,"" ""Asian Rut,"" ""Mute Witness,"" and ""Driving your Girlfriend Home"" are other tracks that set the tone for the album. Morrissey creates his music with such precise words that can only be described as poetry. The level of craft involved in his songwriting is remarkable, and the instrumentation is a perfect accompaniment to the lyrics.

Morrissey's vocals always convey a complex mixture of emotions, but they're at their best in the ballads. ""There's a Place in Hell for Me and My Friends,"" is no exception, as Morrissey's words paint a vivid picture of a love affair heading for disaster. Morrissey's voice conveys an undercurrent of sorrow and despair throughout the song.

So, what makes ""Kill Uncle"" the album you need to listen to? The album showcases Morrissey's skilled songwriting and variety of emotions he is known for, and the music keeps the listener engaged with its unique blend of rock and alternative music. Even if you're not familiar with Morrissey's previous works, ""Kill Uncle"" is definitely an album to listen to. It's the perfect example of an artist who understands what they want to say and how they want to say it while giving it a unique twist. 

To conclude, ""Kill Uncle"" is an album that every Morrissey fan should have in their collection. The album superbly shows off the artist at the peak of his powers, and it is a testament to his skills in storytelling through his music. If you haven't listened to Morrissey's ""Kill Uncle,"" you are missing out on a true masterpiece.","1.

The Handsome Family,Honey Moon,Rock,7.2,April 27 2009,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Brett and Rennie Sparks have been recording together as the Handsome Family for 14 years now, but they've been married for 20. To mark their china anniversary, the couple are foregoing a retrospective of their seven studio albums (although they're certainly due) in favor of a brand-new Family album, fittingly titled Honey Moon. Rather than dwell on country gothic doom and despair, they've recorded all manner of love songs-- odes to sex, devotion, redemption, sacrifice, New Mexico, and more sex-- that are only slightly sunnier than their usual fare. But don't expect corny sentiments even from a song called ""Love Is Like"": Even commemorating two decades together, they indulge the dark edges of these eccentric and personal songs, as if love is all that keeps the abyss at bay. Love is like, Brett sings, ""a black fly buzzing in the sun"" or ""the hole torn right through the roof."" Nevertheless, even at its most ruminative, Honey Moon sounds like a celebratory record, a document of the ups and downs that define any marriage. As if responding to the airports and strip malls of 2006's Last Days of Wonder, these new songs are so full of woodsy imagery that they make Neko Case seem urbane. The only modern edifices here are the pawnshops and neon signs on ""A Thousand Diamond Rings"", and they are transformed into a romantic setting by the ""watermelon light"" of the sun setting over the desert. Nothing stands out as boldly as ""Weightless Again"" on Through the Trees or ""Tesla's Hotel Room"" on Last Days, but the lighter mood suits them sweetly. ""Darling my darling, look at my waving antennae,"" sings Brett on ""Darling, My Darling"". There may be a dick joke hidden in that opening line, but there's more Henry Miller than Franz Kafka as the songs follows the man-as-bug metaphor to its logical conclusion: ""I'll leap on your spine and love you till you gnaw me down to my wings/ I'll give you everything."" That the songs comes across as sweetly romantic and devoted until death-- as opposed to either showy or creepy-- is a testament both to Rennie's skillful threading of words into images and Brett's sensitive translation of words on a page into vocals. In the Handsome Family, Brett and Rennie divide musical duties the way some couples assign household chores. Blessed with a humble, hollowed-out-like-a-tree-trunk baritone, he does most of the singing. An accomplished novelist and poet, she does most of the songwriting. On Honey Moon, Rennie displays a typically observant eye for the small details that become portentous with meaning: A flock of birds beckons thoughts of escape, a sunset changes their world for just a few minutes each day, and a cement mixer inspires existential ponderings. Brett and the extended Family set her deep thoughts to sparse arrangements with subtle animating flourishes like the dreamy 1950s rock piano of ""Linger, Let Me Linger"", Dave Gutierrez's spidery dobro on ""When You Whispered"", or Brett's hoarse whistle on ""The Loneliness of Magnets"". Interestingly for a group most commonly associated with story-based songs, Honey Moon sheds all narrative concerns for more descriptive language. Even ""When You Whispered"", whose title implies a mystery about what exactly was whispered, is less worried over the quiet verbal exchange than the scenery around them: the wind on the bridge, the ripples of water beneath, the frogs on the shore. The album is full of similar tableaux: These songs are dioramas depicting the New Mexico wilderness as a reverberation of the couple's desires.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12878-honey-moon/,Carrot Top,2009.0,"If you're looking for an album that will take you on a journey through the wilds of country rock, then Honey Moon by The Handsome Family is an excellent starting point. With a rating of 7.2 out of 10, the band's latest offering brings together an array of eclectic sounds and storytelling to create a record that's both accessible and challenging.

The Handsome Family, consisting of husband and wife duo Brett and Rennie Sparks, has been around since the early 1990s. They have become known for their off-kilter approach to Americana music and their unconventional songwriting style. Honey Moon is no exception to this, as it sees the band embracing their idiosyncratic sound, with Brett's languid guitar licks and Rennie's trademark baritone delivering lyrics that are both poignant and humorous.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Tiny Tina,"" which is an ode to the dolls of the same name. The song may seem lighthearted at first, but it soon reveals a deeper history of pain and loss in the lives of the characters that inhabit it. Another standout is ""The Red Door,"" which explores the feeling of being cut off from the rest of the world. The song is full of subtle details, and the way that Rennie's voice is layered over the instrumentation gives it an otherworldly feel.

If you're looking for an album that's easy to pick up and listen to, then Honey Moon might not be for you. But if you're willing to take the time to delve into its complexities, then you'll discover a record that rewards repeated listens. With esoteric lyrics and a sound that's simultaneously familiar and fresh, The Handsome Family has created an album that continues their tradition of exceptional storytelling.

Anasazi,Calculating Components and Compound Formulas for Mass Population Reconstruction,Metal,2.6,May 31 2001,John Dark,,"I went $10,000 into the red and defaulted twice on my student loans for my anthropology degree, so I sure as shit am going to begin this review by pointing out the obvious significance of this band's name. The Anasazi were the ancient forebears of the Native American Pueblo people, who dwelt in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest. The Anasazi, or ""Ancient Ones"" as they were known in the Navajo tongue, famously disappeared 700 years ago, leaving behind cryptic ruins, scattered evidence of sophistication in astronomy and pottery, and one of the most challenging archaeological puzzles in North America. No one knows where they came from or where they went. There. But what does that have to do with the band? Admittedly, not much. We know where the hardcore quartet came from: they sprung fully armed and armored from the foreheads of seminal Santa Cruz cult hardcore bands Mohinder and Jenny Piccolo. Likewise, we can guess where they're going: one LP, a couple split seven-inches, and then scattered to the winds like spores of fungi to form other like-minded bands. But let's stick to the present. The Anasazi are as unforgivable as they are unforgiving. Sonically, Measurement and Control is a terrible mythological beast. The sound is that of the deep, sonorous larynx of a Cthulhu-ish monster steeped in bile and vitriol. A guttural excretion. It almost dares to walk the line of the unlistenable. All the trappings of deep hardcore are present: tinny drums perched atop the mix, a treble wash, submerged vocals, and enough makeshift, vicious distortion to wipe out a civilization are blendered with lethal centrifugal force. The result is a murky mess. Where it aims for the bottled fury of Jenny Piccolo, it sails wide right. When it reaches for the smarter, more original work of Mohinder, it falls short, dying by the hand of its own ambition. The titles are wonderfully vivid: ""Getting One's Message from His Formaldehyde and Autistic Animal Pieces,"" ""Premeditated Amphetamine Killing Spree,"" and ""Holy Crusade Against the Godless Forces of Intercellular Communism."" However, the Anasazi clearly shot their creative wad coming up with these elephantine names, because the music itself remains uniformly and consistently bland, unfeeling, rote hardcore. The lyrics, meanwhile, are blunt and literal throughout: ""At war with bureaucrats/ This land is our land/ Crush their buildings/ Torch their homes/ Burn their money/ We die for them no longer/ Kill 'em all."" And then there's the more economical, ""Sleep/ Eat/ Work/ Drone/ Life bled dry."" Those are complete songs, by the way. Measurement and Control opens with an eerie pump-organ feedback effect on ""Xenophobic Dictators Commense [sic] the Hidden Agenda to Eradicate the Purveyors of the Holy Church."" The song crescendos before purposefully imploding under its own awkward, bulky weight. The music halts abruptly to showcase bumped pickups, half-strummed chords, and other studio found-noise that sort of forms a segue into the next track. The record almost finds its gimpy stride halfway through when the songs begin to congeal somewhat more effectively. ""Mosquitoing Vector Control"" displays the pest-like buzzing of its titular namesake. The band plays tighter on this song than anywhere else on the album, and to a certain degree, the musicianship carries through the frequent tempo and stylistic changes of the following two tracks. The disc ends with the tightly wound, more traditional-sounding hardcore burst, ""Fortress."" However, these apparent improvements are only relative to the earlier failures. Measured against their own forebears, as well as their contemporaries, the Anasazi leave a lot to be desired for the discerning hardcore fan. Some of the best moments on Measurements and Control lie in the brief garnishes that preface half the songs. Kitschy and playful, they range from a space-synth nod or two to a snatch of newscast lead-in music. But these are neither intended to be taken seriously nor developed beyond the short, diversionary preamble. Measurement and Control is an aural plague of biblical proportions, imagery that would no doubt suit the Anasazi just fine, with all the dermatological festering-- blisters, boils, lesions, running sores-- they personify through their music. It's about as enjoyable as a pus-oozing, gangrenous wound.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/177-calculating-components-and-compound-formulas-for-mass-population-reconstruction/,Troubleman Unlimited,2001.0,"Calculating Components and Compound Formulas for Mass Population Reconstruction by Anasazi is a bold attempt at creating a modern metal album with a rating of 2.6 out of 10, and while it may not be a unanimous hit, there is no denying that it is a courageous and unconventional approach to the genre.

Anasazi is a band that has been around for a while now, but they haven't quite made a mark in the industry yet. They have been creating music for over a decade, and this is their sixth album. The band’s history is contentious, with lineup changes, creative roadblocks and label pressures being cited as some factors for their struggles.

But their struggles don't reflect in the final product. The creation story behind this album is an interesting one, with the band members coming together to create a cohesive sound that was both heavy and experimental. The result is an album that features complex rhythms, intricate melodies, and technical guitar work that require a few listens to fully appreciate.

The album opens with the track ""Structural Organisation of the Gravitational Waves"" which sets the tone for the rest of the album with its aggressively heavy riffs and growling vocals, but then turns into surprising time signature changes that keep you on your toes. This track is followed by ""Cognitive Stimulation via Fiber Optical Networks,"" a track that shows the band's diversity, with an ethereal intro that precedes a burst of energy.

As the album progresses, it becomes clear that Anasazi is interested in pushing the boundaries of traditional metal music. ""The Molecular Genetics of Maternal Care is a track that features a lullaby-like intro before turning into a crushing crescendo of sound, showcasing the diversity of the band's talents.

The musicianship on Calculating Components and Compound Formulas for Mass Population Reconstruction is exceptional, the song arrangements are complex without being inaccessible, and the production is excellent. But having said this, this album isn’t for everyone. Those who are looking for traditional metal, full of ear piercing riffs, and fist-pumping choruses, are likely to be disappointed.

As a listener, I appreciated the level of creativity and sophistication that went into the album, but I found it challenging to connect with the songs on an emotional level. While the technicality of the music is awe-inspiring, I found myself missing the emotional aspect that is synonymous with the metal genre.

Overall, Calculating Components and Compound Formulas for Mass Population Reconstruction by Anasazi is a unique album that is worth giving a listen to, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. The album screams of the band's potential, and I'm excited to see where they go from here.","1.

Various Artists,Cartagena! Curro Fuentes & The Big Band Cumbia And Descarga Sound Of Colombia 1962-1972,,7.6,March 9 2011,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"Discos Fuentes is Colombia's pre-eminent homegrown record label. When Antonio Fuentes established the label in Cartagena in 1934, he also established the Colombian recording industry, and over the course of the rest of his life built Fuentes into a powerhouse-- it's still an independent company today, releasing records at a prodigious clip. Fuentes died in 1985, but his legacy rings through Colombian music of nearly every stripe today. It was Fuentes who produced the first cumbia, fandango, and porro records in Colombia, Fuentes that oversaw the collision of African, Caribbean, and Colombian styles that gave rise to champeta and some of the country's other distinctive musical exports, and Fuentes that provided a home to dozens of the nation's most important musicians. Today, the founder's grandchildren run the label, hosting a massive collection of ringtones, desktop wallpapers, mp3s and CDs on their website. So building an understanding of Colombian popular music necessarily requires building an understanding of Discos Fuentes, the same way building an understanding of the American pop charts in the 1960s would require learning about Motown. The UK-based Soundway label has been to Colombia for two prior compilations, Palenque Palenque, and Colombia!, the latter of which provided a sort of panorama of sounds released on Discos Fuentes in the 60s and early 70s. On Cartagena!, Soundway founder Miles Cleret collaborates with principle compiler Roberto Gyemant and Quantic's Will Holland (who lives in Colombia) to paint a vivid picture of the hot cumbia music stewarded into record by Curro Fuentes, the youngest brother of the original Fuentes family that founded the label. Curro Fuentes produced most of these tracks, and even plays on many of them. This music bears a heavy jazz influence, and in particular a strong affinity with the big Cuban bands of the immediate pre-Castro era. Cartagena is one of Colombia's gateways to the Caribbean, so the sounds of merengue, plena, and embryonic salsa all made their way there as the bands on this set developed their sounds. Group musicality is emphasized across the compilation, though there are plenty of great, compact solos, such as the supple, trad jazz-informed clarinet lead on Lucho Bermudez's ""Fiesta de Negritos""-- Bermudez was one of Colombia's first bandleaders to heavily absorb the influence of North American jazz in the 1940s, and though his style wouldn't be out of place alongside Artie Shaw, it works well with the chunky 60s cumbia sound. In fact, listening to the whole compilation all the way through reveals a general tension between the old and what was then new-- they vacillate between using electric and standup bass, accordion, and organ, and electric guitars make a few understated appearances, too. One concession to modernity that's universally avoided is the drum kit. The beats are driven by percussion sections that are a lot of fun to listen to-- checking all the different ways the washboard-like güiro can lock in with congas, timbales, and claves to push a song along provides several enjoyable listens alone. On some tracks, the güiro's role is filled instead by hi-hat on the upbeat, which gives the songs that feature the sound, such as Orlando Fortich's ""Yolanda"", a funkier feel, though none of these tracks strive for anything like what we'd think of as a true funk beat. That's actually one of the refreshing things about the compilation-- labels focused on 20th century tropical pop music seem to have become much more comfortable in recent years with straying from the Western funk-inspired sounds that originally sparked so much interest in the music of the middle latitudes. 1960s Colombian cumbia has its own effusive charm, and I like that we're getting to hear more of that. Discovering music from outside your own culture is a gradual process of letting go of what's comfortable and accepting different attitudes toward what music should aim for, and a set like this is a great next step for a listener who's ready to move past the old focus on funk and get into a different kind of groove.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15182-cartagena-curro-fuentes-the-big-band-cumbia-and-descarga-sound-of-colombia-1962-1972/,Soundway,2011.0,"Hola amigos! Today I want to share with you my thoughts on the incredible music album, ""Cartagena! Curro Fuentes & The Big Band Cumbia and Descarga Sound of Colombia 1962-1972"" by various artists. This album has a rating of 7.6 out of 10 and belongs to the nan genre, which is a unique and dynamic music style that blends traditional rhythms with modern elements.

But before we delve into what makes this album so outstanding, let's first explore the fascinating history of the band and the album itself. Curro Fuentes, a respected music producer from Colombia, was looking to infuse some new energy into the music scene of Cartagena using the classic rhythms of cumbia, porro, and descarga.

To do so, he assembled a group of talented musicians and singers who were eager to collaborate and create something special. Together, they produced a vibrant and dynamic sound that captured the spirit of Colombia's rich musical history.

This album is a testament to their talent and dedication, as it features some of the most memorable and exhilarating songs of the time. The music is a lively combination of brass instruments, guitars, and drums that will get your feet tapping in no time.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""La Cumbia Triste,"" a slow and mournful ballad that will leave a lasting impression on anyone who listens to it. It's a beautiful song that is both melancholic and uplifting, a true testament to the versatility of the musicians involved in its creation.

Another fantastic track is ""Improvisando,"" a lively instrumental that showcases the instrumentalists' skill and improvisational abilities. It's a perfect example of how nan music can combine the traditional with the avant-garde, creating a sound that is entirely unique and captivating.

Personally, I have been a fan of nan music for years, and this album exceeded all of my expectations. The energy and passion of the musicians involved in its creation are palpable, and it's hard not to feel uplifted and transported to another world when listening to it.

Overall, ""Cartagena! Curro Fuentes & The Big Band Cumbia and Descarga Sound of Colombia 1962-1972"" is a must-listen for anyone interested in nan music or world music in general. It's an album that should be celebrated for its artistry, its energy, and its message of unity and collaboration.","Step 1: Analyzing the style and language used in each review.

Bachelorette,My Electric Family,Pop/R&B,7.5,June 10 2009,Amy Granzin,Contributor,"However opaque some of her ideas, Annabel Alpers is transparent when it comes to album titles. The New Zealander's last release as Bachelorette, 2008's Isolation Loops, was indeed a solo affair that, with its crackerjack melodies and lush, layered self-harmonies, made as much gorgeous electro-pop noise as any one-person project, but also erred on the side of solipsism. On that record, Alpers probed evergreen themes of loneliness and alienation via technology, peeling off lyrical barbs about vacant modern relationships (memorably in ""Duet Minus One"", ""I went to his house/ He offered me food/ I only accepted tea/ Because it's gluten-free"") in her aloof, robotic lisp. Her new LP, My Electric Family, attempts to break the self-referential loop, opening up emotionally and expanding Bachelorette's circle to include some unexpected sounds and-- perhaps more important symbolically than in fact-- other musicians. Opener ""Instructions for Insomniacs"" signals this shift immediately with rhythmic, repetitive guitar strumming, Alpers' bare voice, and the unlikely strains of pedal steel. The song soon dusts itself off and climbs on the backs of a looped electronic flute figure and Alpers' multi-tracked ahs to a glorious crescendo. The new players' rootsy influences provide welcome texture to the project's typically synthetic mixes, but ""Insomniacs""' slow build and kaleidoscopic explosion is already something of a Bachelorette trademark. Alpers repeats the trick on the otherwise dour, sample-cobbled track two, ""The National Grid"", and later by layering keyboard lines, percussion, and finally boisterous horns, on ""Dream Sequence"". ""Her Rotating Head"" is one of several songs on the record that sweats with disco fever, nostalgic, disembodied handclaps and squiggly-line analog synths included. With her cool and kittenish alto, Alpers is a credible indie-dance diva and the song's melody is memorable enough, but what makes ""Head"" special is its final minute's critical mass of layered vocals glinting and somersaulting through space. She may fear becoming a machine, but when Alpers folds herself into the electronic process, the results are delicious, even ecstatic. Alpers is so adept at intricate bedroom pop that I sort of wish she'd leave it at that, because she tends to undermine Bachelorette's power with incoherent and insincerely applied themes. My Electric Family is less isolationist than its predecessor, seeming to concede the possibility of human relationships and providing a glimpse into Alpers' inner life. ""Where to Begin"", for example, adeptly captures the yearning pathos of people with mostly online lives (""On the computer/ Observing strangers/ Ignoring those around you""). But she starts to muddy the waters when she dabbles in dystopia. ""Technology Boy"" asserts to dorky bleeps n' bloops that the titular character ""attempts to live his life as a machine/ But then his humanness experiences utilitarian resentment."" Sound and fury, meet nothing. ""Mercurial Man"" and ""Her Rotating Head"" also spit up silly logic-defiers and broadcast sentiments that seem ripped from a retro-futurist style manual. Retro-futurism's a durable and persistent pop culture trope, currently burning up the design world on every front from mid-century modern-inspired furniture to steampunk fashion. But unmoored from original context and free-floating in the past's imaginary future, it's style, not substance. There's absolutely nothing wrong with pop music that just wants to sound sleek and sexy and goad you into singing in the shower or dancing deliriously (and some would argue that's all pop should aspire to). Bachelorette, however, seems to harbor loftier ambitions. But although Alpers has found a winning sound, she's still scrambling to gather her notes and draft a theme she can deliver with conviction.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13227-my-electric-family/,Drag City,2009.0,"Hey guys, today I'm here to review the latest album by Bachelorette - 'My Electric Family'. This album marks a comeback for the band after a brief hiatus, and it's definitely worth the wait.

Bachelorette is a New Zealand-based Pop/R&B band that has been active for over a decade. They've previously released four studio albums, with 'My Electric Family' being their latest offering. The album was released in early 2021, and it's garnered quite a bit of buzz within the music industry.

Listening to the album, it's easy to see why it's gaining so much attention. The first thing that stands out is the diversity of sounds that Bachelorette brings to the table. From the ballad-like ""The National Grid"" to the upbeat pop track ""Dream Sequence,"" the album has something for everyone.

The creation story behind this album is just as interesting. Apparently, Bachelorette recorded a bulk of the music in her bedroom studio during the pandemic. This level of intimacy and solitude in the creation process is evident in the music as well. The songs have a dreamy, almost ethereal quality to them that can transport the listener to another dimension.

Personally, I really enjoyed this album. Bachelorette's voice has a raw yet delicate quality that works perfectly with the instrumentals. It's almost as if her voice is an extension of the music itself. The harmonies are beautiful, and the production is spot-on.

Standout tracks for me include ""Dupleix Liquid"" and ""Vertigo"". ""Dupleix Liquid"" has this really great bassline that hits hard and gets your head bobbing almost instantly. ""Vertigo"" is more of a ballad but still manages to captivate the listener with its hauntingly beautiful melody.

If I had one criticism, it would be that some of the songs tend to blend into each other. But this is a minor quibble, and overall, I think Bachelorette has done an excellent job with this album.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of Pop/R&B music or just looking to expand your musical horizons, 'My Electric Family' by Bachelorette is definitely worth a listen. It's a solid 7.5 out of 10 for me.","Step 1: Review A contains more complex language and intricate descriptions, while Review B uses simpler language and more concise descriptions.

Step 2: Review A references specific lyrics and delves into the themes and motifs presented in the album, while Review B focuses more on the overall sound and feel of the album.

Step 3: Review A provides more critical analysis and evaluation of the album, noting strengths and weaknesses, while Review B is more straightforward in its praise of the album.

Conclusion: Based on these factors, it is likely that Review A is the human written review due to its more complex language, specific references to the music and lyrics, and deeper critical analysis. Review B, on the other hand, appears to be a simpler, more concise overview of the album that lacks the nuance and depth typically found in human written reviews.",0.8725726171281718,Review A
Caribou,Our Love,Rock,8.6,October 7 2014,Jamieson Cox,Contributor,"Dan Snaith spent the first decade of his career attacking a wide range of genres with the intensity of an autodidact and the cerebral coolness of an academic. Back when he was still recording as Manitoba without fear of legal challenges from disgruntled punk veterans, he dissembled the IDM of the late 1990s and early ‘00s on debut Start Breaking My Heart before moving on to kaleidoscopic, colorful psychedelia on Up in Flames. From there, it was on to chugging krautrock and rich, melancholy ‘60s pop on The Milk of Human Kindness and Andorra, respectively; the 2010 LP Swim, cobbled together from leftover DJ set material and inspired by the sounds of deep house and contemporary club music, grew his fan base further. Despite the huge breadth of sounds they explore, these albums all share an essential playfulness and engrossing curiosity. It’s always been enjoyable to hear Snaith dive deep into a new passion and emerge with a new record awash in the ecstasy of influence: finely detailed, in love with its inspiration, simply tuneful, and yet thematically complex. Our Love, his first album as Caribou in four years, is his first full-length that doesn’t come with a major shift from the sound of its predecessor. This is body music on the same general wavelength as Swim, albeit slightly warped and refined. The differences, then, are deeper: this is Snaith’s most overtly personal record to date, one that’s remarkable for its intimacy, openheartedness, and joy derived from basic human connection. Our Love is a quietly ambitious record, despite its modest title: in documenting Snaith’s personal vision of love, it seeks to render love in all of its universally complicated glory. It’s a warts-and-all depiction of a state of being that’s so often constrained to one or two facets in pop songs: obsession and disconnection, passion and jealousy, companionship and loneliness, all given equal weight. From the outside, Snaith looks the picture of domestic bliss, or at least stability—he’s been married for 13 years, and his first child was born in 2011—but many of Our Love’s lyrics hint at romantic trouble or marital discomfort. Nameless characters feel mistreated, are haunted by lurking suitors and bad memories, lament their broken love, look towards the future; when they’re in love, it’s with an intensity that verges on the maniacal. But it’s reasonable to conclude that the album’s songs aren’t near-direct transcriptions of events and feelings from Snaith’s life; instead, they’re extremes pulled from the necessarily complicated life two people build together over years and years, rich with joy but laden with baggage. In any long-term relationship, there are moments of deadening melancholy where you feel like your organs have been put through an industrial shredder. It’s in those moments where you sniff at imagining your life completely different, or even with someone else—fantasies enabled by intense emotional pain. And then, somehow, things get better, and your heart is overflowing with love; you’re almost in disbelief, thinking, “How could I imagine a different life, even for a second?” Our Love captures the zig-zag between these two poles with an authenticity and honesty few albums manage, and the album’s excellent two singles, “Can’t Do Without You” and “Our Love”, focus on the latter sensation. The kind of complex, slowly shifting relationship the album seeks to depict is mirrored by its own relationship to “dance music,” a term that’s broadly applicable to Our Love but awkward and inadequate upon closer examination. Snaith is an accomplished DJ, remixer, and producer, and he has a rock-solid grasp on the mechanics of the dancefloor: he understands how to get people moving, how to sustain intensity, and how small moves behind the boards can yield surprising results. A good example is the way he uses dynamic variation on highlights “Can’t Do Without You” and “Back Home”, using volume to make hooks hit that much harder. His 2012 record as Daphni, Jiaolong, was a dance nerd’s delight, a lean and brittle release forged by crate-digging and the need to churn out hours of material for marathon sets at European clubs, and its influence is felt in subtle ways on Our Love. This album is glassy, warped, and largely digital where Swim was bold, bright, and decisively analog in places; there’s a warmth to it, but much of it comes from Snaith rather than his largely digital soundscapes. That said, Our Love only really glances at straightforward dance composition before choosing to shrug it off and take a different path. Most of the album is too slow and strange for the club, and its songs mutate in ways that are unexpected and offer different kind of rewards. The title track spends four minutes building to a strobe-lit, wildly pulsing frenzy, only to turn left into a lovely string outro arranged by contemporary maestro Owen Pallett, a longtime Snaith pal. The back half twosome of “Julia Brightly” and “Mars” are the two tracks that offer any kind of predictable dance-oriented pleasure, and even they’re a little off-kilter, with the former’s searing synth washes and the latter’s perky flute melody. The key attribute is ultimately confidence. Our Love is a very assured record, from its unconventional, austere arrangements to its unrelenting focus and thematic consistency. This can be traced, in part, to Snaith’s solid collaborative circle: from respected advisors like Kieran Hebden and his wife to other artists like the aforementioned Pallett and Jessy Lanza, he’s surrounded himself with people he trusts and appreciates, freeing him to take risks and pursue a pure artistic vision. Pallett’s arrangements on the title track, “Silver”, and closer “Your Love Will Set You Free” lend a lightness to an album that sometimes verges on uncomfortable depth; Lanza’s winning feature on “Second Chance” is a welcome dose of female perspective on a record dominated by Snaith’s, her melody and fluttering voice taking the album from one person’s love to something larger. Speaking of voices, Snaith’s isn’t half bad either: a reluctant vocalist earlier in his career, he’s improved by leaps and bounds since then, lending an imperfect humanity to these songs even if he’s not quite carrying them. His imperfect delivery makes plenty of sense in this context, anyway: you can imagine him warbling these songs to his wife, or turning them into lullabies for his daughter. It’s a subtle cultivation of intimacy, but one that works in driving home the album's central conceit: that the love you feel for your partner, and the life and family you can choose to shape together, can be transformative. It’s hard work, and it’s not always easy, but it pays remarkable and lasting dividends. It can change your perspective and the effect you want to have on the world, and Our Love is a worthy tribute to that messy, unbelievably powerful force.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19762-caribou-our-love/,"Merge,City Slang",2014.0,"Hey there music lovers! Today, I'm excited to talk about the latest rock album from Canadian artist Caribou - 'Our Love.' For those of you who aren't familiar with Caribou, let's start with a brief history of the band. Caribou, originally known as Manitoba, was formed in 2001 by talented multi-instrumentalist Dan Snaith. Over the years, the band's sound has evolved from psychedelic folk to electronic and rock fusion.

Now, let's get back to the album 'Our Love.' The album's creation story is quite interesting - Snaith began working on it after his father passed away, and he used music as a way to cope with his grief. This personal aspect of the album is evident in its lyrics, which explore themes of love, loss, and moving on.

With 'Our Love,' Caribou has crafted a truly unique sound that blends elements of electronic and rock music. The album is filled with intricate beats, lush instrumentation, and Snaith's signature falsetto vocals. The opening track, ""Can't Do Without You,"" is a standout - it's both catchy and emotional, with pulsing beats and soaring synths. Other highlights include the dreamy ""Julia Brightly"" and the catchy ""Silver."" 

But what really sets 'Our Love' apart is Caribou's ability to create an immersive sonic experience. The album flows seamlessly from one track to the next, creating a cohesive and dynamic musical journey. Snaith's attention to detail in the production and arrangement of each song is evident throughout the album, and it makes for a truly captivating listen.

Overall, I'd give 'Our Love' by Caribou an 8.6 out of 10. While it might not be for everyone, it's a must-listen for fans of electronic and rock music looking for something fresh and innovative.

Lotic,Agitations,Electronic,8.2,November 19 2015,Jonathan Patrick,Contributor,"The 30-minute mixtape Agitations finds producer Lotic (aka J'Kerian Morgan) at his least accessible, most grating, and perhaps not coincidentally, his most ambitious and stirring. ""Agitations was born out of the frustrations that come with touring... and feeling increasingly out of touch with club culture and with the music industry in general,"" Morgan said in preface to his latest release. Accordingly, the music distances itself from the cyclical payoffs and rhythmic underpinnings of the dance floor. This is miles away from anything that could be considered ""club culture."" There’s something acutely alien about the tracks Morgan constructs, as if the producer is dealing in a musical language that's yet to fully emerge. Throughout Agitations, Lotic's signature spidery sound design is subjected to further mangling via a series of violent jump-cuts and jarring bursts of noise. The arrangements treat sounds and themes like raw materials in need of repurposing: Each unit is contorted, smashed, and remade, either splintering into abstraction or writhing in glitchy tumult. Yet, for all the mixtape’s disorienting ruptures and serrated edges, Agitations, much like 2014's Damsel in Distress and this year’s Heterocetera EP, again reveals Lotic as a sly, playful producer. On Heterocetera, Lotic sampled the ballroom standard ""The Ha Dance"" by Masters at Work, reshaping it radically, and he alludes to this same sample again here in the opening moments of *""*Carried"". This version sounds pared-down and pixelated, a mutation of a mutation, and it's a microcosm of Agitations' tendency to tease out strange turns in familiar currencies. Agitations might not be conventional dance music, but it remains both fiercely visceral and highly visual. It lacks Damsel in Distress' mastery of cultural memory, and Heterocetera's propulsive push-and-pull, but more than makes up for it in raw dynamism; a dogged, thrilling futurism hinged on brute energy, angularity, and unremitting disquiet. Moving in dense, unstable clusters, the mixtape can be taken as a celebration of frustration, liberation, and chaos, a means for Morgan to work through the restlessness and anxiety he's faced of late. For an artist who's consistently latched onto and forged a style as imaginative as any in the electronic underground, Agitations shows Lotic pushing still further ahead.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21277-agitations/,Janus,2015.0,"Electronic music has always been a genre that thrives on the intersection of sound, technology, and art.

Lotic's Agitations is a perfect example of this, with its blend of experimental soundscapes and visceral beats living up to its 8.2 rating.

For those unfamiliar with Lotic, they are an electronic music producer from Texas, known for breaking new ground in the music industry. Their previous work includes the critically acclaimed 2018 album ""Power,"" which was an exploration of identity and the human experience.

The creation of Agitations, however, was a much more personal journey. Lotic struggled with depression and anxiety, and the album is a reflection of those emotions. The tracks on the album are a mix of dark, brooding soundscapes and fast-paced beats, and each one tells a different story.

For me, the standout track is ""Fragility."" It's a slow-burning, haunting piece that captures the feeling of vulnerability, with its delicate piano melody and distorted vocals. Another great track is ""Solace"", which picks up the pace with a frenetic drumbeat and ethereal electronics that progress to a more intense experience.

Agitations is an album that challenges the listener, with its intricate beats and experimental soundscapes. It's not the kind of album you can put on in the background and forget about; rather, it commands your attention, taking you on an emotional journey that is both dark and beautiful.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of electronic music and experimental soundscapes, you won't want to miss Lotic's Agitations. It's a masterpiece of modern music that deserves all the accolades it has received. Whether you're dealing with personal struggles, or simply seeking an emotional and sensory experience, this album should definitely be on your playlist.","Step 1: In Review A, the author provides details and descriptions about the music, including quotes from the artist about the creation of the album.

The Dandy Warhols,Welcome To The Monkey House,"Electronic,Rock",3.3,July 16 2003,Andrew Bryant,,"""My favorite part of the show was when he took off his shirt...dreamy."" As if to accent the comment, she made a sweeping motion across her brow with one hand-- wiping away invisible sweat-- while the other deftly locked itself around the steering wheel. Agitated-- she knew I was being forced to see a band I had no true interest in-- there was surprisingly little hesitation in her voice when she asked, ""Didn't you enjoy it?"" Its not as if The Dandy Warhols and I have any bad blood between us, but my previous exposures to the band have been sordid to say the very least. True, I met my significant other and eternal concert partner while absentmindedly reviewing Thirteen Tales of Urban Bohemia for my college radio station-- her noticing the empty jewel-case beside my bag and inquisitively approaching me as I listened-- but those tunes have waned appreciably over the years, turning balanced neutrality into mild disparity at the mere mention of Courtney Taylor's troupe. Add to this sentimental nostalgia my recent concert attendance, and my initially lukewarm feelings of distaste mutate into venomous and irascible abhorrence. Petty as it may be, I fully admit that I am not above disliking a band based solely on the fact that they cater to my fears of inadequacy as a male and mate. Of course, the only reason I mention this is to caution the patient reader against lambasting my opinion of Welcome To The Monkey House based solely upon the above numerical rating and any personal adherence one may have to Dandy-ism. While it's true that I hold damning grudges against some musicians for no other reason than misdirected machismo (guilty feelings? mere jealousy?), I would never pan the actual music if it fairly displayed some amount of talented songwriting and quality. To wit, I would sooner punch every member of the Saddle Creek family in the nose-- barring The Faint and Now It's Overhead-- than shake their hands or say hello, yet I continue to surreptitiously purchase and endorse every recent Bright Eyes release. Thus, believe the heart of this kindred music-lover when I state that Monkey House is comparable to and nearly as enjoyable as a pelvic exam with chilled instruments-- seemingly fun, but shaky and ill-advised. Beginning on a warble-- the sound of Courtney Taylor's tongue drilling directly through his cheek-- the title track is a short and typical Warhols' sound that pokes fun at the fabric of pop-culture while simultaneously unraveling it. Flippantly spouting off lines such as ""When Michael Jackson dies/ We're covering Blackbird"" would be laughable and forgiveable if delivered over any accompaniment other than the dry and clipping electric guitar line that the group pounds out for the song's brief temporal existence. Partly redeeming is the transition into ""We Used To Be Friends"", a track that fully exhibits the aided production by Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran-fame. On it, one can hear the warm synthesizers-- otherwise known as Dandy's flavor-of-the-month-- replacing nearly all traces of the guitar in the group's sound, as Taylor pinches his prostrate in some unsettling, yet strangely alluring falsetto vocalizations. A comfortable furniture-filled-room production leaks into ""Plan A"", a track that sports another D2-member, Simon Le Bon, on back-up vocals. Musical influences and heart vying for equal space on the band's sleeve, the song is catchy enough with a unique sonic layering of acoustic and electronically derived sounds, but suffers for its inability to let go-- the chorus of ""all of us, sing about it"" suffering well past its time of captivation or interest. Similar tracks-- ""Insincere Because I"", ""Heavenly"", and the morose ""You Came In Burned""-- suffer the same fate, drawing out tunes that couldn't hold anyone's attention for thirty seconds, much less beyond the five minute mark. Not content with their own lackluster tune, ""I Am A Scientist"" drags one of Robert Pollard's best songs through the mud, the band hijakcing the experience of Chic guitarist/producer Nile Rodgers in the process. Preaching atop an empty pulpit, Courtney drops ironic faux-pedagogic phobias such as ""I try to live on science alone"" and ""I tell you what, mathematically I'm happening,"" before plunging into another hard-beat/fuzzy-bass loop that ends on a whimper of instrumental ornamentation. Equally predictable: the slight-guitar return of ""I Am Over It"", the Tony Visconti-produced and T. Rex/Bowie aped ""Hit Rock Bottom"" and ""The Dope"", and the slower jangle-pop genesis of ""I Am Sound"". A bright spot amongst the tarnish is the Evan Dando co-write ""You Were The Last High"", the song that undoubtedly gets the group another quarter of a million records sold-- the A-Ha influenced composition that will cause phone company executives' ears to perk up in advertisement bliss. Alternately sounding like the mix-tape song of choice for your average sixteen year-old girl in the throes of first-luv or a Jarvis Cocker solo release, ""The Dandy Warhols Love Everyone"" rounds us out as best as can be expected-- doo-doo's and wah-ooo-oooh's augmented by electronic beats and a twice-bitten fuzzy bass line. Unfortunately, these songs highlight the poseur mentality and insincerity that paradoxically plagues and blesses The Dandy Warhols-- one side of the coin endowing them with innocent condescension of their musical roots, the other holding them accountable for their acoustic laziness in the face of so much potential. The decision rests solely with the band now as to whether future releases will make good on this latent talent, or whether they will continue to rely upon breathy sighs, the crowd-pleasing rush of hedonistic pleasure, and the infidelity of exposed nipples.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2162-welcome-to-the-monkey-house/,Capitol,2003.0,"Welcome to the Monkey House: A Disappointing Addition to The Dandy Warhols' Repertoire

As a long-time fan of alternative rock and electronic music, I was excited to dive into The Dandy Warhols' 2003 album ""Welcome to the Monkey House."" Unfortunately, my listen left me feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. With a rating of 3.3 out of 10, it appears I'm not alone in this sentiment.

For those unfamiliar with the band's story, The Dandy Warhols formed in the mid-90s in Portland, Oregon. Frontman and vocalist Courtney Taylor-Taylor leads the group, which also includes guitarist Peter Holmström, keyboardist Zia McCabe, and drummer Brent DeBoer. Over the years, the band has experimented with various genres, blending psychedelic rock with electronic elements in their sound.

""Welcome to the Monkey House"" is a departure from the band's previous work, relying heavily on electronic beats and synthesizers. The album was produced by Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran, which may have contributed to the new wave influence permeating the sound. While experimentation is always welcome, the execution on this album falls short.

Songs like ""We Used to Be Friends"" and ""You Were the Last High"" have a catchy quality to them that will likely stick in your head. However, beyond the surface-level catchiness, the songs lack depth and creativity. The lyrics feel forced and repetitive, relying too heavily on rhyming rather than meaningful storytelling.

Another issue I had with this album is the lack of cohesion. The songs feel like a music mishmash, thrown together without much consideration for a consistent sound or narrative. The track ""I Am a Scientist"" is one example of this, featuring a spoken-word interlude that feels out of place and unnecessary.

As someone who enjoys The Dandy Warhols' previous albums, ""Welcome to the Monkey House"" was a disappointment. While I appreciate the band's willingness to experiment and branch out from their comfort zone, the execution fell flat. There are some catchy moments, but the lack of depth and cohesion make this album forgettable.","1.

Cut Chemist,The Litmus Test,"Electronic,Jazz,Rap",6.1,September 23 2004,Cameron Macdonald,,"The mainstream hip-hop status quo makes Cut Chemist a progressive artist by default-- which is odd, given that he rarely samples any break off a record released post-1990. Lucas McFadden belongs to the now-""underground"" tradition of cutting high-fiber joints anointed with ""Funky Drummer""-era grooves that sound like house party highlights. His oeuvre is nakedly contrary to the MTV-sold, crunk bourgeoisie who downsize their music to stick-figured beats and loop Scarface-mused, orchestral arrangements ad nauseam. And no matter how often cynics attempt to bury hip-hop turntablism as a dead form, McFadden-- and a handful of worthy contemporaries-- still make the music feel timeless. And that's why The Litmus Test is such a frustrating tease. The collection is a ""mash-up"" of his solo tracks, remixes and collaborations with Jurassic 5, all serving as a public reminder of who Cut Chemist is before McFadden drops his new album next year. Litmus better qualifies as a medley on par with those hip-hop performances at the Grammys or BET Awards that are over-focused on dance choreography and cramming all the hits into three minutes. The 28-minute record serves as a decent primer for neophytes, but Chemist frequently interrupts some of his best moments before they complete their sentences. The Litmus Test opens not with just one, but three intro tracks. First comes ""This Is"", a massage-oiled, Latin-funk flavored teaser that sets the scene with street hustler chatter that eventually morphs into the album's actual ""Intro"" track. Then, McFadden turns a corner with an octopus-limbed drum break that introduces ""Bunky's Pick"", a brilliant survey of Stones Throw's excellent 2001 garage-funk comp The Funky 16 Corners. Jurassic 5's Cosby Kids-esque loitering anthem ""Concrete Schoolyard"" suddenly intervenes. Unsurprisingly, tunes from that ""positive rap"" group predominate The Litmus Test to the point that the record almost seems more like a J5 outtakes collection than a Cut Chemist statement. And while McFadden and fellow J5 DJ Nu-Mark's production on their ""Jayou"" has aged gracefully, Cut Chemist has done enough stronger work elsewhere that its inclusion here seems superfluous. Fortunately, there are a handful of worthy non-J5 inclusions here: Blackalicious tracks ""Chemical Calisthenics"" exemplifies what a perfect balance Chemist is capable of striking between experimental beatmaking and simply providing an emcee with something to spit over. On the Blazing Arrow version, he treated virtually every syllable Gift of Gab spat about the periodic table-- and the Litmus version improves that feat with an awesome, spy-flick brass break that wags its finger at the swinger lying in the gutter. Sadly, ""Alphabet Aerobics"", where McFadden tortured Gift of Gab's lyrical rundown of the alphabet with a sped-up, treadmill beat, is completely missing from this record. The hospital's burn ward is overwhelmed: J5's ""Swing Set"" is reduced to 46 seconds (halted by a bandleader asking, ""Do you want to dance?"", and being answered with a wiseass ""Hell no!""), their ""Lesson 6""s arithmetic jingle is almost completely obliterated, and the folksy violin solo performed on Chemist's own ""S.N.T."" (possibly the single best moment off Loose Groove's classic Funky Precedent compilation) has its plug pulled after one note. At least McFadden kept most of the levitating beats that enriched his greatest remix: Major Force's ""Re-Return of the Original Art-Form"". Now, some may say Chemist has a right to treat his own work like this, and he does. But while the hip-hop song always remains an unfinished composition, that doesn't mean that honorable ideas-- and classic tracks-- should be sacrificed like this.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1781-the-litmus-test/,Quannum,2004.0,"If you're a fan of electronic music, jazz, and rap, then Cut Chemist's ""The Litmus Test"" is an album that's worth giving a spin. I had the pleasure of listening to it the other day, and while it wasn't necessarily a game-changer for me, it definitely held its own and showcased some truly impressive talent.

Cut Chemist, aka Lucas MacFadden, has been a staple of the electronic music scene since the late '90s, gaining fame as a member of the rap group Jurassic 5. His solo work has always been more experimental, blending different genres into a sound that's uniquely his own. On ""The Litmus Test,"" Cut Chemist explores the intersection between jazz, rap, and electronic music with a keen sense of depth and experimentation.

The production on the album is top-notch, with each track sounding like it's been carefully crafted to showcase a particular sound or mood. The jazz influences are particularly evident, with songs like ""Rhythm Method"" and ""Madman"" incorporating live instrumentation to stunning effect. The rap elements are also strong, with tracks like ""Work My Mind"" featuring some slick verses from rapper Chali 2na.

While I enjoyed the sonic diversity on display here, I did find myself wishing for a greater sense of cohesiveness. The album can feel a bit disjointed at times, with some tracks feeling like they don't quite fit in with the rest. It's clear that Cut Chemist is going for something ambitious here, but the album could benefit from a stronger overarching concept or theme.

That being said, ""The Litmus Test"" is not an album that you should overlook. Cut Chemist is a talented producer with a keen ear for blending different genres, and he's clearly pushing himself to explore new sounds and styles. While not every track hits the mark, there's enough here to make it worth your while. At a rating of 6.1 out of 10, I'd say it's a solid effort with plenty of room for growth.","1.

Moneybagg Yo,2 Heartless,Rap,7.2,February 23 2018,Jackson Howard,Contributor ,"Memphis rapper Moneybagg Yo’s voice falls somewhere between the monotone largesse of his mentor, Yo Gotti, and the watery warble of Kevin Gates. It’s a voice that, at first listen, is unremarkable, but, after a few songs, reveals its humor and dexterity like a magic trick. Like his voice, Moneybagg himself is a revelation hiding in plain sight. Largely unknown to mainstream rap audiences but a full-blown celebrity in his hometown and, increasingly, beyond, he’s finally starting to see the payoff to his patient and calculated approach to regional rap stardom. The street album Federal 3x, the highlight of his highly productive 2017, debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 last summer, outselling SZA, Ed Sheeran, and Bruno Mars that week. A polished collection of outsized brags and ominous trap instrumentals that lacked a clear single or a notable guest appearance outside frequent collaborator YoungBoy Never Broke Again, that album provided the strongest argument yet that Moneybagg is headed toward a broader breakthrough. 2 Heartless, Moneybagg’s first project of 2018, builds on his momentum. At a bloated 18 tracks, it lacks the efficiency of Federal 3x, or the bounce of Moneybagg’s 2016 collaborative tape with Yo Gotti, 2 Federal. But the new album, which features Quavo, Gotti, BlocBoy JB, and Lil Baby, succeeds as a fruitful exercise in sticking to what works. This isn’t to say that Moneybagg’s execution is simplistic. Instead, he’s a self-sufficient enterprise of one, capable of conveying on his own what many rappers struggle to do with help. It’s sometimes hard to identify the highlights of a Moneybagg project, but that’s the point: Whether threatening his enemies or mourning lost love, his songs purposefully blend into one another, making his albums best consumed in a single sitting. In an age of relentless single-chasing in rap music, Moneybagg Yo’s low-concept, consistent work ethic is refreshing. Moneybagg, a 26-year-old father of seven, is a master of colorful wordplay. Each song is a treasure trove of quotables: “Fire up the Backwood, it smell like a skunk dead,” he snarls on “Back Then,” “I been gettin’ to it, a hundred thou trap cash/Pockets lookin’ like bunk beds.” On the Tay Keith-produced standout “Super Fake,” he takes a similar thought a step further: “Chandeliers on both my ears, my earrings look like two lamps,” he starts, before continuing in the same breath, “This might not mean nothin’ to you, but I used to get food stamps.” Moneybagg wields vulnerability the same way he does his boasting, with an offhanded speed that nonetheless provides a deeper look into his psyche. His reliance on rhetorical questions and conversational ad-libs—“Remember Mario from eleventh grade?/(Remember me from Mitchell?)” he asks on “Super Fake”—can make it sound like he’s talking to himself, or confiding in a close friend. Really, though, he’s more of a lone wolf. “Earn my trust, keep all my secrets,” he whispers in the fading moments of 2 Heartless, rewarding us for making it to the end of yet another project. But unlike most musicians on the come-up, Moneybagg genuinely doesn’t seem to care if you listen. He’s so brazenly secure in his sound, so convinced of his impending success, that you’re left feeling like you have to win him over, and not the other way around.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/moneybagg-yo-2-heartless/,N-Less,2018.0,"Moneybagg Yo's '2 Heartless' is a rap album that showcases the strengths of our contemporary and dynamic music culture. From the beguiling introductions of ""Black Heart"" to the hauntingly sad notes of ""Bigg Facts,"" the album entraps you into the world of Moneybagg Yo’s rapping genius.

This album might not be a revelation in the rap music scene, but it is undoubtedly a testament to the kind of hard and gritty work that goes into making any album a hit. For Moneybagg Yo, the process of creating '2 Heartless' was a long journey, both emotionally and career-wise. It's not an understatement to say that it's one of the most anticipated hip hop albums of the year and he delivers on every level.

Coming off the success of his previous album 'Federal 3x,' Yo had a lot of expectations to live up to. Yet, he manages to exceed all of them in this release. The album is a reflection of his growth – personally and artistically. And it's his storytelling that makes it a standout. 

Whether he's reflecting on his struggles with past relationships or addressing longstanding critiques that he only raps about money and women - '2 Heartless' proves that Moneybagg Yo is in control of his artistry and emotions. 

The album is a nod to his roots and also a tribute to the undeniable talent that is prevalent in the rap scene in Memphis. This is a scene that he honed his skills and brought the full scope of what's captivating and inventive about rap music today.

The first track, ""Black Heart,"" serves as an excellent opener that draws on the introverted nature of Moneybagg Yo. The beat is pulsating, and the lyrics are sharp as they showcase the art of the storyteller. Throughout the album, we can hear other collaborators, such as Young Thug on ""Mandatory Drug Test"" that brings a fresh flavor to the table. 

As the album progresses, Moneybagg Yo delves deeper into the double-edged sword of being in the spotlight. ""Correct Me"" is a track that delves deeper into the traps of fame while reflecting on his own career. His journey in the music industry is the reason why he lands tracks that could, at first, sound like cliches or generalizations, but he makes it amply clear that it's an examination of his life experiences.

In conclusion, '2 Heartless' is a must-listen to rap album, especially for those of us looking for an escape into the realities of Moneybagg Yo's world. The album transcends the superficial and delves deep into the emotions and experiences that make us human. With its standout tracks, commanding storytelling, and impressive selection of collaborators, this album deserves a spot on your playlist. It might not be his magnum opus, but it is certainly a great testament to his artistry and an excellent addition to his discography. Overall, I'd rate it a solid 7.2 out of 10.","1.

Ying Yang Twins,U.S.A. (United State of Atlanta),"Pop/R&B,Rap",7.5,July 10 2005,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"Earlier this year, a curious little track called ""Wait (The Whisper Song)"" quietly trickled on to the internet, eventually becoming a leftfield hit with an expensive video and an all-star remix. Over a minimal bass pulse and a few finger-snaps, the Ying Yang Twins turned down the volume on their gravelly crunk howling to whisper intense X-rated come-ons: ""Hey, bitch, wait till you see my dick/ I'ma beat that pussy up."" Sexually exploitative hip-hop is nothing new, but this track's air of menace and complete lack of subtlety made it the last straw for more than a few listeners of both genders, a point where they could no longer excuse the casual misogyny in rap music. On the internet, sides formed. Did ""beat the pussy up"" refer to rape or rough sex? Were the whispers threats or seduction? Was it a joke? If it were, would that excuse it? If you're looking for answers, United State of Atlanta isn't going to provide any. ""Wait"" is presented as part of a mid-album sex trilogy, followed by the even nastier spoken-not-sung track ""Pull My Hair"" and the awful quiet-storm slow jam ""Bedroom Boom"", and the three tracks are divided by skits of women with alert, precise speaking voices using spoken-word cadences talking about how they want to get fucked, as if the Twins are saying that intelligent women like this stuff, so it's OK. We also get ""Live Again"", a gliding, melodic mid-tempo track with a hook from (of all people) Maroon 5's Adam Levine, wherein the Twins paint a picture of a woman forced by economic circumstance into a job stripping, hoping to escape every day. And then there's ""Hoes"", where the Twins and female guest Jacki-O talk about hating hoes, with one Twin assuring women, ""If you a bitch and you hate a bitch, you can sing this shit, too!"" There's a lso a song about the inhumanities of the prison system, a bluesy track about the dehumanizing effects of poverty, a song about the Twins' love for each other, a song about Jesus, and a whole lot of songs instructing strippers on how to dance. So. Um. Fuck. Can we talk about the beats yet? Because the beats on U.S.A. are really something. Collipark provides almost all the album's tracks, lacing the Twins' bluesy, throaty voices with gleaming, futuristic jacked-up electro. The best tracks repeat their hooks enough to turn them into mantras, bass kicks exploding and maddeningly simple keyboard lines worming their way into your frontal lobe, Miami bass and Chicago house run through extremely expensive sequencers and morphing into a radiant space-age bounce. It's first-rate club music, and first-rate club music is always worth your attention. People shouldn't feel like they have to excuse or get past ""Wait""-- it's an entirely personal decision. If you feel OK about the track, you'll find that U.S.A. is a good-not-great Southern rap album, overlong and weighted down by too many inept slow tracks but boasting enough furious, kinetic dance tracks to make it worth your money. If you don't, that's fine. Your life isn't going to be any poorer without this album.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8914-usa-united-state-of-atlanta/,TVT,2005.0,"Alright folks, let's talk about one of the most popular albums of the early 2000s: U.S.A. (United State of Atlanta) by the Ying Yang Twins. This 2005 release had the world dancing to its infectious beats and catchy hooks. With a genre-bending mix of pop, R&B, and rap, this album was a beacon of creative expression for a generation.

For those who don't know, the Ying Yang Twins are an Atlanta-based hip-hop duo made up of Kaine and D-Roc. They burst onto the scene in the early 2000s with their hit song ""Whistle While You Twurk"" and quickly established themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the world of hip-hop.

Now as for U.S.A. (United State of Atlanta), this album was a masterpiece of creative collaboration. It features appearances from some of the biggest names in music, including Lil Jon, Pitbull, and Bun B. The album was produced by Mr. Collipark, a well-known producer famous for his use of heavy bass and synthesizer sounds.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Wait (The Whisper Song),"" which features a hypnotic beat and unforgettable hook. While the lyrics are definitely not for everyone, there's no denying the track's catchy and infectious nature. Similarly, ""Shake"" with its catchy sample and energetic beat, has become a staple in clubs and parties around the world.

What's really impressive about this album is the way that it blends together different styles of music. From the bouncy rhythms of ""Jigglin'"" to the mellow vibes of ""Live Again,"" it's clear that the Ying Yang Twins were not afraid to experiment and push the envelope.

Of course, there are some tracks that didn't quite hit the mark for me. ""Bedroom Boom"" and ""13 Hoes"" feel a bit too crude and explicit, and don't really add much to the overall message of the album. But then again, that's kind of what the Ying Yang Twins were known for, so I guess it's just a matter of personal taste.

Overall, I'd give U.S.A. (United State of Atlanta) a solid 7.5 out of 10. While it may not be perfect, it's definitely a fun and entertaining listen. If you're a fan of pop, R&B, or hip-hop, then this album is definitely worth checking out. Plus, with its infectious beats and catchy hooks, it's sure to get you dancing in no time.","1.

Jorge Velez,Roman Birds,Electronic,7.9,January 10 2019,Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,"Jorge Velez has long been prolific, but that’s been especially true in the past few years. Like many underground electronic musicians, the New York producer has taken advantage of the internet’s self-publishing opportunities—in particular, the direct-to-fans platform Bandcamp—to sidestep label gatekeepers, streaming services, and crowded retailers. (Velez’s Bandcamp page currently numbers 26 releases.) Velez first gained recognition a dozen years ago with blippy disco derivatives for labels like Italians Do It Better, but his output has gradually become more esoteric and inward-looking. He’s still capable of ebullient club tracks, as last year’s excellent Forza attests, but many of his long, undulating machine jams sound like late-night missives to himself. Roman Birds, released with no fanfare at the end of 2018, feels a little like that: a collection of private thoughts accidentally caught on tape. Purely ambient, it’s his most abstracted music in years, even more so than his 2016 L.I.E.S. album, Animals Disk. At the same time, it’s one of the most inviting things he’s ever done—a short, beguiling record that feels enveloping because it holds its secrets so close. “The best creations for me are the ones that seem to materialize out of nowhere—a few hours lost in the sounds being made, in arranging and removing and creating spaces for every element to breathe and act,” Velez has said of Roman Birds. These five tracks move with a dreamlike logic, their ruminative loops unspooling like unmediated transmissions from Velez’s subconscious. Every track offers a variation on a murky, overarching mood, and they share a basic structural approach, running multiple sequences in parallel, unsynchronized and out of phase. Their burbling, overlapping pulses eventually come to resemble the inside of a lava lamp. His synthesizers’ microtonal tunings lend a viscous dissonance, a kind of coppery gleam; there are no hard edges, no sharp attacks. It feels like a dream of breathing underwater. The opening “Heart,” the most skeletal of the bunch, sounds like at least three totally unrelated tracks playing at once. A dubby echo of Pole’s early albums rubs up against a chorus of tree frogs; a graceful synth lead, silvery and understated, glides over the top. A flickering riff during “Memory Spreads West and East” might remind certain listeners of a futuristic sound effect heard whenever Lee Majors used his bionic powers in “The Six Million Dollar Man”; the song’s psychoacoustic timbres and rich stereo processing seem to swim around your head. “Roman Birds” is the most peaceful and contemplative of the lot, with rippling tones speeding and slowing over tangled loops. During the final two tracks, “Irriss” and “A Breeze You Can Swallow,” Velez’s pulses become thick and gelatinous, while the synths in the high end burn bright and clear, a little like Blade Runner. There’s no real melody here, just the hint of one, which rises up out of the churning depths and hovers, trembling, like an afterglow. It’s remarkable how evocative something made with so few simple elements can be: The music licks like flame, dribbles like water, and settles, ultimately, like layers of very fine ash. Roman Birds was inspired, Velez says, by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius that buried the city of Pompeii nearly 2,000 years ago. Eerie, unsettling, and elegiac, it is a strangely moving tribute to that distant tragedy—and among the finest music Velez has ever made.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jorge-velez-roman-birds/,Self-released,2019.0,"Let me start by saying that the electronic genre has always been a bit of a mixed bag for me. While I appreciate the technical skill and creativity that goes into creating electronic music, I often find it difficult to connect emotionally with the music. However, after listening to Jorge Velez's latest album, ""Roman Birds,"" I must say that my perspective has shifted significantly.

Firstly, let's talk about the band's history. Velez, a native of the Bronx, has been an underground electronic music mainstay for over a decade. He's released numerous LPs and EPs under various pseudonyms and has collaborated with some of the biggest names in the game. But with ""Roman Birds,"" Velez brings a fresh new perspective that sets it apart from his previous works.

What struck me most about this album was the sheer range of emotions it evokes. Tracks like ""Forgotten Transmissions"" and ""Soft Overgrowth"" sound mournful and introspective, while ""Aurora In The Attic"" and ""Myrrh"" have an uplifting and sunny quality. It's rare to find an album that can truly elicit such a wide range of emotions, but Velez manages to do it with grace and precision.

The album's creation story is equally fascinating. Apparently, Velez took inspiration from ornithology, the study of birds, to construct the album's themes and structure. The music really does take flight, both metaphorically and literally, with bird calls and samples weaving in and out of the tracks. It's a testament to Velez's creativity and willingness to experiment that he was able to create such a cohesive and unique album out of a seemingly unconventional source of inspiration.

Personally, ""Roman Birds"" has quickly become one of my favorite electronic albums in recent memory. I've listened to it on headphones during my early morning runs and found the music to be both energizing and soothing. I've also played it in the background while working, and have found it to be the perfect accompaniment to my concentration. There's something about the layered beats, textures, and atmosphere that makes the music both stimulating and calming all at once.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of electronic music, I highly recommend giving ""Roman Birds"" a listen. Velez's passion and creativity are evident in every track, and the album serves as a testament to the artistic potential of electronic music. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're open to exploring the genre, ""Roman Birds"" is a great place to start. I personally give it a solid 8.5 out of 10.","1.

Various Artists,"12""/80's",,6.2,March 16 2005,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"The 80s! Sick of them yet? In the early 90s, the measures of people in their 20s against their teenage 80s plasticity resulted in everything sounding like Grand Funk. In the early 00s, everyone realized the 90s were a drag and wondered if there was something to that Thompson Twins thing after all. I anxiously await whatever Jill Sobule/G-Funk hybrids the early 2010's will bring us! The 12"" single was the art form of the 80s. They were the last gasp of the single as a physical, commercial artifact. Disco made the 12"", and it brought disco's dub-space and length to everything it touched. Yes, even the Thompson Twins. Sure, it's survived via dance music, but today what comes between those elongated intros and outros is a lot less likely to be a song. (Oh, but what about the cassingle? Well, it destroyed the B-side. The CD single gives us up to six bullshit ""remixes"". So you were saying?) Now just look at that cover up there: those stark white letters, that deep salmon background, that gorgeous boombox. It's enough to give the design fetishist in me an erection of the heart. And the idea of a compilation of 80s 12""'s already wins points as they were some of the first records I ever bought. And this comp makes a pretty good case for all the various aspects of the 12"" philosophy. The Cure's ""A Forest"" just goes for sheer treetop scaling length. Scritti Politti's ultra-brite (p)op-art stabs and gimmicky samples are a mini-essay in mid-80s remixing-- as well as on what the 80s did to punk. Grace Jones' ""Pull Up To The Bumper"" all but invents M.I.A. (yeah, I said it) except scarier and better. The Icicle Works' ""Love Is a Wonderful Color"" is one of those ""wow where was this hiding?"" tracks that make you think there's something left to 80s crate-digging. On some level, I should just be able to write ""Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go?"" and go out for a beer. 12""/80's is one of those collections that-- due to concept, packaging, and a goodly portion of its contents-- I want to grace with a much higher rating. But I can't deny one thing: There's a Simply Red song on this box set. If you meet a beautiful boy with a unibrow, you can shave it, but it's always going to grow back. Likewise, you can skip tracks here, but Mick Hucknall, the unibrow of pop, returns every time you replay it. There is some real wack, horrid shit (Lloyd Cole? The Style Council??) next to the unmitigated triumphs (Yazoo, they can never tarnish you). Plus, it's too white (only one rap song and no Prince), too British (understandable since it's a UK import, but a U.S. version is urgent and key), and too in thrall to the whole ""80s = stuff you hear in a dentist's office"" idea. Also, despite containing two Trevor Horn productions-- ABC's Fairlight panto-cabaret ""Tears Are Not Enough"" and Propaganda's Bergman-funk ""Dr. Mabuse"", there's no Frankie Goes To Hollywood! You wouldn't make a box set called 7""/60's and leave off ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine""!",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2072-1280s/,Family,2005.0,"The 12""/80's album is a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Featuring a collection of tracks that defined the decade of New Romantics and classic pop, this album is a must-have for anyone who grew up during that era or for music lovers who appreciate the influence of that time. With a rating of 6.2 out of 10, this album might seem unimpressive to some, but for true aficionados of pop, this album is a gem.

The compilation features various artists, including Duran Duran, Human League, and Spandau Ballet, who all contributed to shaping the sound of the 1980s. Each track holds its own value in terms of individual style and flair. The dynamic range of tracks featured on the album is impressive, with upbeat pop tunes like ""Tainted Love"" and ""Love Shack,"" to more mellow sounds like ""Blue Monday"" and ""Fade to Grey."" Whichever direction you lean towards, there is something for everyone on this album.

The creation story behind 12""/80s is rich and fascinating. As the 1980s were coming to a close, the music industry embraced a new format: the 12-inch vinyl single. The extended length of the vinyl allowed for additional sound manipulation and production techniques, which allowed artists to create longer, more mesmerizing tracks. Remixes and extended versions became the norm, and many tracks were simply reworked from their original format.

The fusion of this new format and the rise of new technology sets the stage for the album. It is a testament to the creative innovations that were happening in music production during that era. The album is a walk through history, showcasing the development of electronic sound and its ability to take the listener on an evocative journey.

As someone who was raised during those times, listening to 12""/80s felt like taking a tour through moments of my youth. I could not resist the swagger in 'Girls On Film,' the youthful angst in 'The Look of Love,' or the sensual feelings of 'Slave to Love.'

The album packaging design is also a significant selling point. The collection comes in the form of a boxed set, featuring a retro design of a neon cassette tape with a bright pink cover. The tracklist is printed on the back of the cassette, just like a mixtape that one would receive from a friend back then. It truly transports one back in time to the neon-lit dance floors of the past.

In my opinion, 12""/80's is a celebratory ode to a time when the pop scene was on the cusp of change. The birth of the synthesizer and electronic sounds defined that era, and this album encapsulates that journey perfectly. It's an unforgettable experience that will leave the listener nostalgic yet excited for the future development of music production.

Therefore, I highly recommend this album to anyone who loves pop music or wants to discover its rich history. Whether you are a fan of 80's music or a new listener, the music featured in 12""/80s will transport you back to a time of big hair, neon colors, and unforgettable hits.","1.

Ensemble Pearl,Ensemble Pearl,,7.4,March 22 2013,Grayson Currin,Contributor,"On paper, Ensemble Pearl isn’t supposed to sound quite so subdued: The new quartet is led by Stephen O’Malley, the stage-right guitarist in thunderous hooded drone giants Sunn O))). Though they’ve explored a range of intricate ideas and dynamic approaches during the last 13 years, they’re perhaps best known for extreme volume, with tidal riffs powered by an arsenal of linebacker-sized amplifiers. In Ensemble Pearl, O’Malley is accompanied by Bill Herzog, the former bassist in Jesse Sykes & the Sweet Hereafter, and the two flashiest members of Japanese metal pillagers Boris-- Atsuo, the bare-chested and gong-banging drummer shouting into the microphone attached to his face, and longtime collaborator Michio Kurihara, a guitarist whose playing seems to thrive partially on sonic showmanship. If you dreamed a team for heavy rock with psychedelic tendencies, this ensemble would be an acceptable fantasy. But Ensemble Pearl, the quartet’s elegant six-song debut, serves as a spotlight for the plasticity of the musicians that made it, not their power. The brief “Wray”, for instance, recalls little else in the vast catalogues of Ensemble Pearl’s principals. Above a wafting drone that suggests a choir of glass harps, the band adds granulated guitar notes that scrape and pop over guest Eyvind Kang’s mercurial viola tones. For the bulk of the album, however, you’ll likely recognize O’Malley’s steely tone and deliberate progressions from Sunn O)))’s more spare moments. But he avoids the monolithic sound of that group, or their full-length collaboration with Boris, 2006’s Altar. Instead, he etches his riffs here at a relatively low volume. During the smoldering seven-minute “Painting on a Corpse”, he traces each arid note toward its vanishing point. If Sunn O))) began as an Earth tribute band, Ensemble Pearl is an extension of Earth’s latter-day testudinal blues. “Island Epiphany” begins with a similarly subdued lurch, but it rises steadily in both density and decibels. Nine minutes in, the track nears its apogee of intensity, Kurihara webbing sheets of noise and sustain through the rhythm section’s insistent trot and O’Malley’s still-flickering riff. Even then, though, the music feels more like a conversation than a shouting match or, in the case of Sunn O))), an ordered instrumental chant. That conversational aspect is crucial for Ensemble Pearl, a record whose layers connect with one another without coercing one another. Though Atsuo has certainly been at times quiet with Boris, his playing here stands as some of the most patient and considered of his career. When the guitars go a bit wild during “Island Epiphany”, he and Herzog stay the course, fostering tension by providing an anchor. He does little more than keep time with his snare and add texture with his cymbals for “Ghost Parade”, and that distance gives even his smallest contributions that much more impact. Ensemble Pearl seems very much about sustaining the balance between being present and passive, or using minor devices to create major effects. To that end, “Giant”-- the late-album, sans-drum drone charged by amplifier hum, and Kang’s viola-- stands as this band’s crowning achievement. These 10 minutes are thick but strangely luminous. The sound is as unified and overwhelming as the audio environments La Monte Young built with the Theatre of Eternal Music, but every element is clear and balanced. You’ll notice moments of twinkling timbre and radiating noise just beneath the hum, telltale signs of the real-time interaction between the players in the room. That interaction began in 2009, when the band first assembled in Tokyo to start writing material that became part of Gisèle Vienne’s multimedia play, This is How You Will Disappear. Those sessions only began to take shape as an album after the players realized how much they enjoyed working together, so, years later, they returned to the material and finished it stateside with producer and engineer Randall Dunn. Later this year, O’Malley reports, Ensemble Pearl will likely begin work on a new record with additional members. That’s good news not only because this debut itself is compelling but because, at last, it represents a clear synthesis of so many of O’Malley’s activities. In recent years, Sunn O))) has limited its activity to rare live shows, reissues, and rehearsal releases, freeing O’Malley to explore the more experimental realm of his muse. Last year, his duo KTL released its best disc yet, V. His new label, Ideologic Organ, has issued excellent and overlooked work from composer Mats Lindström and improviser Norbert Möslang. He’s improvised with Tim Hecker and Steve Noble, and at May’s Tectonics Festival in Glasgow, he will perform both with American innovator Alvin Lucier and Romanian spectralist Iancu Dumitrescu. That dossier is meant to say that, of all his projects, Ensemble Pearl feels like a probable and timely place for O’Malley’s past with Sunn O))) to collide with his future outside of it-- that is, a laboratory with purpose.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17680-ensemble-pearl-ensemble-pearl/,Drag City,2013.0,"Ensemble Pearl's self-titled debut album showcases the talents of an eclectic group of musicians who have come together to create something truly unique. If you're not familiar with the members' previous projects, you might not know what to expect from Ensemble Pearl. But if you're familiar with Sonic Youth, Nine Inch Nails, and Boris, you'll have a better sense of what this band is all about.

The band was formed back in 2012, when experimental rock band Boris joined forces with ambient musician Tim Hecker, Sunn O))) guitarist Stephen O'Malley, and drummer Atsuo of the band Boredoms. I was first drawn to this album by the sheer curiosity of what a collaboration between such diverse and talented musicians might produce.

The album's opening track, ""Ghost Parade,"" is a slow-building soundscape of droning guitar, ethereal vocals, and a pulsing beat that creates a hypnotic and ominous atmosphere. The album continues to take the listener on a journey through various emotions and textures. The song ""Wray"" showcases a more upbeat and driving rhythm, influenced by post-punk and industrial music. ""Painting On A Corpse"" brings to the forefront the band's penchant for creating intense sonic landscapes, with layers of distorted guitars and eerie vocals.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Island Epiphany,"" which features sparse instrumentation and haunting vocals that create a sense of longing and melancholy. It's a striking contrast to the heavy and sometimes chaotic soundscapes that dominate the rest of the album.

Overall, Ensemble Pearl's self-titled album is an impressive achievement that showcases the diversity and talent of its members. The album is a solid 7.4 out of 10 for me. While it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate experimental music that pushes boundaries and challenges the listener will find a lot to love here. It's the kind of album that demands to be listened to closely, with headphones on and no distractions. So take a deep breath and let yourself get lost in the sonic world that Ensemble Pearl has created.","1.

Washed Out,Life of Leisure EP,Electronic,8.0,September 16 2009,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"Did our parents give us too much self-esteem? Not that long ago, message boarders could diss and dismiss boring new bands (insert your least favorite post-punk revivalists here) for sounding like ""a copy of a copy of a copy."" Fast forward just a few years, and that's exactly what some of the most exciting new bands sound like. Pastiche and intertextuality are as ancient as postmodernism-- not to mention disco, hip-hop, and the remix-- but childhood memories, in particular, are present now like never before. Today's blockbuster movies are based on yesterday's beloved toys; today's wars and political battles are sequels, too. It isn't surprising that music would reflect the zeitgeist. What's striking is how an international cohort of rising artists has successfully translated this culture of watery VCR transfers and Fisher-Price cassette rips into 1980s-inspired psychedelic music. Names like Ducktails, Reading Rainbow, VEGA, Pocahaunted, and, especially, Memory Tapes tell you a lot about where these disparate reminiscers are coming from. Arguably, more than genre tags like ""glo-fi"" or The Wire critic David Keenan's ""hypnagogic pop,"" but those labels can be useful, too. Washed Out, the solo project of Georgia (via South Carolina) multi-instrumentalist Ernest Greene, fits in almost too well with the balmy lo-fi synth atmospherics of peers like Neon Indian, Toro Y Moi, Small Black, the higher-fi jj, or the darker, heavier SALEM, as well as the more guitar-based Real Estate, Best Coast, and Pearl Harbour. Washed Out's debut Life of Leisure EP, out digitally now and on 12"" early next month (another release, the cassette-only High Times, arrived September 15), isn't at the top of its class, but Greene so far is one of this fledgling aesthetic's most gifted students. Focusing on romantic nostalgia and homespun textures, Life of Leisure does with 80s soft rock and synth-pop what Glass Candy and Chromatics did with Italo disco a couple of years ago, only Washed Out evokes summer afternoons indoors rather than the Italians Do It Better crew's early-a.m. urban stalking. Out-of-sync PBS-theme synths and videogame lasers meet funky horn breaks on opener ""Get Up"", as Greene's slurry vocals suggest deep pain. A sampled sax sighs mournfully behind a chopped-up voice, Cut Copy-pasteable beats, and some more indistinct singing on ""Lately"". Life of Leisure's six tracks, whether poppier and more approachable like ""New Theory"", or moody and alarming like ""Hold Out"", tend to cut off suddenly, which gives the EP an appealing, unfinished quality. Like hearing a work in progress: Greene has only been making music under his current moniker for a couple of months, so don't come flaming me if his live shows suck or his Dave Fridmann-produced sophomore album flops in 2013. More than some contemporaries, though, Washed Out submerges a sense of intense feeling within its 80s-fantasy electronic ether. Greene's ""copy of a copy"" distance, then, comes across as a form of emotional repression. The yearning-in-utero effect is strongest on woozy centerpiece ""Feel It All Around"". With blurry singing, cheap-sounding synths, and a humid, syrupy flow, the track suggests an 80s synth pop hit that won't come straight out and cop to itself-- or a young man in love, too tongue-tied (or too stoned?) to admit it. ""You feel it all around yourself,"" Greene echoes. As for what ""it"" is, the song never says. If this review itself reads like a ""memory of a memory"" (to sample another phrase from Keenan), blame ""Feel It All Around"". Days after the filing of a final draft packed with trenchant insights drawn from the similarities between the track's choral drone and 10cc's 1975 hit ""I'm Not in Love"", it came to light that Washed Out's signature tune is actually based around a loop from Gary Low's 1983 single ""I Want You"". The words you're reading changed; the rating didn't. ""You're soooooo... fine,"" it sounds like Greene's finally able to bring himself to say on finale ""You'll See It"", one of the EP's loveliest and most tuneful tracks; ""Don't you fight it."" OK, I have to go fast-forward through NutraSweet and Sylvania commercials to watch the TV movie of Alice in Wonderland with Ringo Starr as the Mock Turtle now.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13438-life-of-leisure-ep/,Mexican Summer,2009.0,"Today we're going to talk about one of the most remarkable EPs to have come out of the electronic scene - the Life of Leisure EP by Washed Out. Released in 2009 by the record label Mexican Summer, the album has garnered a rating of 8.0 out of 10, which is no small feat.

Washed Out is the brainchild of American singer, musician, and record producer Ernest Greene. After graduating from the University of Georgia in 2005, Greene started his solo project under the name Washed Out, taking inspiration from chillwave and dream pop music genres. His breakthrough came with the release of his first EP, Life of Leisure, a stunningly crafted masterpiece, which gained critical acclaim and solidified his place in the electronic music world.

The album's dreamy instrumentation and mesmerizing vocals transport the listener to another world. Every sound on this EP, from the airy synths to the crisp drum machines, is meticulously produced and layered to achieve a sonic experience that's simply blissful. The first track, ""Get Up,"" sets the mood for the rest of the EP with its mellow guitar riffs, soothing synth pads, and soothing beats.

The most brilliant and memorable track on the EP, in my opinion, is ""Feel it All Around,"" which is featured in the opening credits of the TV series Portlandia. The song has a hypnotic quality, with its swirling synths and hazy vocal samples that seem to dance around the listener's ears. The song's melody is pure magic, and its chorus is effortless and catchy.

What sets Washed Out's music apart from other electronic artists is its ability to make you feel like you're in a dream state. The songs have a surreal quality that transports you to a different plane of existence. The lyrics on this EP are minimal, but they complement the music perfectly, enhancing the dreamy atmosphere and the sense of detachment from reality.

In conclusion, Life of Leisure remains a groundbreaking EP that's as captivating now as it was ten years ago. Ernest Greene's creative genius is evident from the first track to the last, and it's no surprise that his work has been so influential in the electronic music world. If you're a fan of chillwave, dream-pop, or electronic music, then this EP should definitely be on your playlist.  So, it's worth giving it a listen and immerse yourself in the beautiful sonic universe of Washed Out.","Step 1: Look at the language used in each review. Review A contains more complex language and uses phrases like ""culture of watery VCR transfers"", ""pastiche and intertextuality"", and ""David Keenan's 'hypnagogic pop'"". This suggests that Review A may be generated by a model, while Review B contains simpler language that is more likely to have been written by a human.

Step 2: Review A has a more meandering structure, with long sentences and tangential references to pop culture. In contrast, Review B has a clear structure, with a brief introduction, a discussion of the artist's background and genre, and a detailed analysis of the EP's sound and lyrics. This again suggests that Review B is more likely to be a human written review.

Step 3: Look at the use of personal opinions and observations. Review A contains several references to the reviewer's personal experiences and opinions, such as the use of ""insert your least favorite post-punk revivalists here"" and ""OK, I have to go fast-forward through NutraSweet and Sylvania commercials to watch the TV movie of Alice in Wonderland with Ringo Starr as the Mock Turtle now."" In contrast, Review B presents a more objective analysis of the EP's sound and lyrical themes without relying on personal anecdotes. This points to Review A being more likely to have been generated by a model.

Conclusion: Based on the use of complex language, meandering structure, and personal opinions, Review A is more likely to have been generated by a model, while Review B is more likely to have been written by a human. Therefore, Review B is the human written review.",0.8765937890931608,Review B
"Ikue Mori, Julianna Barwick",FRKWYS Vol. 6,"Experimental,Rock,Electronic",7.3,June 16 2011,Brian Howe,Contributor,"Up to now, Julianna Barwick has not often engaged in collaboration. Her process, which involves layering her voice with a Loop Station, is defined by solitude; a feeling that comes across in her music with full force. So it was a nice surprise to hear that she would contribute to the Rvng label's FRKWYS series of 12"" records, which pairs contemporary and classic electronic artists. Barwick drew Ikue Mori of the seminal no-wave band DNA, who has ably kept up with new technology, evolving from trap sets to drum machines to computer software. The four extended, improvised movements that compose FRKWYS Vol. 6 are familiar turf for Mori, but a whole new world for Barwick. The music was recorded in New York's White Columns gallery last fall-- half with the musicians each isolated in a cubicle; Mori with her laptop and Barwick with her looping console. (A video documenting the performance can be found here.) Right away, with ""Dream Sequence"", fans of Florine and The Magic Place will find themselves in new territory. Barwick's voice is lightly scattered amid an array of computerized slide whistles and metallic resonance-- not an enveloping presence, but a thing among things. Several minutes elapse before she unleashes one of her trademarked melodious shrieks. Playing against Barwick's usual placidity, it's almost chaotic, but still has a clear build, climax, and resolution. Mori's music comes from machines but evokes the natural world, pulling in sounds like dripping water, crackling electricity, and warped chimes. This is consistent across all four tracks, though each has a singular arc and feel once you get past the uniformly distressed surfaces. On ""Stalactite Castle"", Barwick's voice competes with mechanical vortices that call to mind Ellen Allien and Antye Greie. Then she takes a more leading and openly songful role on ""Rain and Shine at the Lotus Pond"" and ""Rejoinder"", with an almost choral home stretch bringing the record to an arresting close. Barwick fans may feel an initial wave of disappointment that this doesn't bash you over the head with holiness the way her records do. And those who appreciate her music through the filter of Enya, rather than Brian Eno, may find Mori's haywire electronics simply indigestible. It's not the sort of thing you just throw on in the background, as The Magic Place could be. But taken on its own terms, it's a sneakily bewitching record that bodes well for Barwick's future. Until now, we knew that she was very good at one thing-- FRKWYS Vol. 6 is an encouraging sign that she's willing and able to branch out.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15538-frkwys-vol-6/,Rvng Intl.,2011.0,"Hello music lovers! Today, I'm excited to share my thoughts on the album 'FRKWYS Vol. 6' by Ikue Mori and Julianna Barwick. This experimental, rock, and electronic album has a rating of 7.3 out of 10, but that number feels too low for the amazing music contained within.

Before diving into the album, let's take a moment to appreciate the bands' histories. Ikue Mori, a composer and improviser, has been active in the experimental music scene since the 1970s, making her an established force in the genre. Julianna Barwick, on the other hand, has gained a following for her ethereal, ambient music since the release of her debut album in 2011. The pairing of these two artists was a genius move, sparking excitement for what they could create together. 

The creation of 'FRKWYS Vol. 6' was an interesting story. The album was recorded entirely in one day with no prior rehearsals or planning, leaving it entirely in the hands of the artists' individual creativity. As a result, the album has a raw, improvised feel to it, with each track taking the listener on a unique sonic journey.

Personally, listening to this album was a mind-bending experience. The music is emotional and otherworldly, with each track standing out in its own way. The opening track, ""Spiral Staircase,"" starts with a single voice twisting and overlapping until it sounds like an entire choir. The beautiful noise of ""The Space Between"" could easily transport you to a different dimension. And ""Departure"" is a haunting and introspective piece that left me in tears.

What makes this album unique is that each track provides a new perspective on the artists' creative processes. Their improvisational approach allows them to take risks and let the creativity flow freely. As a result, the music feels like it's alive and breathing, providing a beautiful and wild soundtrack to accompany the listener. 

In conclusion, 'FRKWYS Vol. 6' by Ikue Mori and Julianna Barwick is a true gem of an album, showcasing two powerful artists at their best. The risk-taking and unstructured approach to the recording process gives the album a unique sound and a powerful emotional connection. I personally recommend this album to anyone who loves experimental, rock, and electronic music and wants to take a journey to a new world.","1.

Jean-Claude Vannier,L'Enfant Assasin des Mouches,,8.4,November 7 2006,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"Composer and producer Jean-Claude Vannier has spent much of the past few decades writing scores for French television and cinema, most of which have gone largely unheard outside Europe. Along the way he has also worked with pop artists such as Brigitte Fontaine and Françoise Hardy, but he remains most widely celebrated for his lavish arrangements on Serge Gainsbourg's classic jailbait concept album Histoire de Melody Nelson. Throughout his work, Vannier has displayed a fearless ambition to communicate a coherent narrative, primarily-- or even exclusively-- through his carefully programmed music. And never were Vannier's grandiose ambitions given freer reign than on his jawdropping 1972 solo debut L'Enfant Assasin des Mouches (The Child Assassin of the Flies). On this bizarre and astonishing album, which B-Music has now given its first official domestic release, Vannier uses every weapon in his considerable arsenal to craft a turbulent soundscape that deftly mirrors the endless commotion and confusion so peculiar to childhood. Originally made available in only 100 promo copies, L'Enfant Assasin des Mouches has long been the stuff of legend amongst serious vinyl collectors, and it isn't difficult to hear why. In conducting the album's unruly pastiche, Vannier seems equal parts Van Dyke Parks and Carl Stalling, drawing impulsively upon multiple classical and soundtrack traditions, sleazy Euro-funk, Middle Eastern modalities, proggy hard rock, and what sounds like the full sound effects library of a large radio theater troupe. The piece's loose narrative structure is provided in the liner notes, written after the fact by Gainsbourg. This macabre little libretto-- which involves a young, fly-torturing child who receives his just desserts when lured down into the underground fly kingdom-- might be screwy enough to make Tommy read like Ibsen, but it does provide a suitably dramatic context for Vannier's violent, often jarring musical juxtapositions. It seems a great understatement to say that L'Enfant Assasin des Mouches is exactly the sort of extravagant 1970s period piece that simply couldn't get produced today, even if someone had the studio resources and the sheer chutzpah to try. Without access to any of today's sampling technology, Vannier was forced to make all of his wild stylistic leaps in multi-tracked real time with real musicians-- employing a string quartet, the Jeunesse de France choir, a full horn section, and special effects ranging from billiard balls to a model helicopter. By using these live sound sources, Vannier was able to give the piece an impression of enhanced physical space and mass, as evident on the opening ""L'Enfant La Mouche Et Les Allumettes"" which shifts abruptly from an audio vérité intro of traffic and tolling church bells into a queasy, vertigo-inducing fog of reeds and roiling percussion. Later, on the majestic ""Danse Des Mouches Noires Gardes Du Roi"", Vannier combines lush, Morricone-like orchestrations and jazz piano in a manner that suggests something of the child's ability to retreat unseen into the world of imagination, an effect further amplified by the playful calliope of ""Danse De L'Enfant Et Du Roi Des Mouches"". Soon, however, events take a darker cast on ""Mort Du Roi Des Mouches"", with the protagonist's unwholesome treachery effectively conveyed via the intrusion of raunchy wah-wah guitars and overcast prog-rock atmospherics. By contrast, the closing miniatures ""Le Papier Tue-Enfant"" and ""Petite Agonie De L'Enfant Assassin"" appear tranquil and practically organic. The flies in their kingdom have apparently chosen to celebrate their eventual victory by indulging in a brief interlude of flute and French café accordion, bringing the tumultuous album to a remarkably peaceful conclusion, as though the world has been returned to a more natural state of order in the child's absence. The music on L'Enfant Assasin des Mouches can often seem so agitated and chaotic that it can become difficult to discern the figure of Vannier himself, unless the meticulously balanced discord can itself be taken to be his true signature. Occasionally the clouds do part enough to seemingly catch a recognizable glimpse of the artist, as when the choral passages of ""Les Gardes Volent Au Secours Du Roi"" provide a brief echo of Melody Nelson's ""Cargo Culte"". By and large, however, Vannier best expresses himself by drawing hidden links between outwardly incompatible musical vocabularies, a strategy later to be reflected in the syncretic concepts of artists like Matmos, dj/Rupture, or Matthew Herbert. That Vannier was able to do so with such a high degree of melodicism, manic invention, and a contagious sense of wonder seems just so much extra frosting.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9573-lenfant-assasin-des-mouches/,"Suzelle,Suzelle",1972.0,"If you're a fan of experimental music, then you definitely need to add Jean-Claude Vannier's ""L'Enfant Assassin des Mouches"" to your listen list. This 1972 album, categorized as nan (a subgenre of experimental music), is a sonic journey that is unlike anything I have heard before. With a rating of 8.4 out of 10, you know you're in for a treat.

To give you some background, Vannier is a French composer, arranger, and conductor who has worked with some of the most prominent musicians in the world, such as Serge Gainsbourg and Michel Polnareff. ""L'Enfant Assassin des Mouches"" was his second solo album and was recorded with a band of talented musicians, including French drummer Bernard Lubat and guitarist Claude Engel.

The album's creation story is just as interesting as the music itself. Vannier was inspired by a book of poetry written by his friend Boris Vian, which he felt perfectly captured the spirit of adolescence. Vannier's goal was to create a musical interpretation of Vian's work and give a voice to the confusion, angst, and passion that comes with being a young person.

From the very first track, ""L'Enfant au Royaume des Mouches,"" you're transported to a dream-like world where anything is possible. The music is a dizzying mix of orchestral arrangements, unconventional instrumentation (such as a toy piano!), and complex rhythms. ""Au Baiser de l'Enfant-Roi"" is a particular standout track for me, with its haunting vocals and unusual soundscapes.

One of the most fascinating things about this album is the way it seamlessly blends different musical genres. There are elements of rock, jazz, and classical music, all blended together in a way that feels fresh and exciting. Despite being created in the 70s, the music is still incredibly relevant today and speaks to the universality of the adolescent experience.

Overall, I highly recommend giving ""L'Enfant Assassin des Mouches"" a listen. It may not be your usual cup of tea, but if you're open to something new, you'll be rewarded with a truly unique listening experience that will leave you feeling both thoughtful and energized.","Step 1: Review A contains a more detailed and in-depth analysis of the album, including background information about the composer and the album's creation story.

"Milton Nascimento, Lô Borges",Clube Da Esquina,"Pop/R&B,Global",9.5,September 2 2018,Andy Beta,Contributor,"If you grew up in the rural area of Rio Grande de Cima back then, you probably knew the two boys as Tonho and Cacau. Whether they were playing football or marbles, swimming in the river or in one of the nearby waterfalls, they were inseparable. One afternoon, Tonho and Cacau were playing on a dirt hill when photographer Carlos da Silva Assunção Filho (better known as Cafi) drove past in a Volkswagen Bug. He braked, shouted to the boys and as the dust settled, snapped their picture. “It was like lightning,” recalls Cafi. “It’s a strong image. The face of Brazil. And it was at the time when several artists were in exile.” Cafi didn’t catch either boys’ name that day, but when he later showed the photo to Brazilian musicians Milton Nascimento and Lô Borges, the two knew they had their record cover for their 1972 double album, Clube Da Esquina. And for many years after the fact, people thought the photo was in fact Nascimento and Borges as young boys. For the next 40 years, the boys on the album cover were a mystery throughout Brazil, one requiring a manhunt of sorts to try and track the boys down. “Someone in the car shouted at me and I smiled,” Tonho recalled some 40 years later, as a reporter and photographer had finally tracked him and his childhood friend down, even recreating the iconic photo. “I was eating a piece of bread that someone had given me, because I was starving. And I was barefoot. But I never knew I was on the cover of a record. My mother will be thrilled. We never had a photo of me as a boy.” While deep in the morass of a brutally repressive military regime, 1972 was a watershed moment for Brazilian pop music, or as it’s often called, MPB: Novos Baianos’ Acabou Chorare, Paulinho da Viola’s A Dança Da Solidão, the duo album from Nelson Angelo E Joyce, not to mention self-titled albums from Tim Maia, Jards Macalé, Tom Zé, and Elis Regina. And after years in exile, Tropicália heroes Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso returned home with career highlights in Expresso 2222 and Transa, respectively. Yet looming over them all is Clube Da Esquina, one of the most ambitious records in Brazilian music history, a double album that not only belongs in the same discussion with others in the Western canon—be it Blonde on Blonde or Exile on Main Street—but one that is even more uplifting and mystifying. The music of Milton Nascimento ranges from the earthy to the angelic, both mysterious and plainspoken, haunting and sublime. Eumir Deodato, who provided string arrangements for Clube Da Esquina and subsequently worked with Roberta Flack, Frank Sinatra, and Kool & the Gang, heard in Nascimento parallels to classical music, but admitted: “To date I have not managed to discover the rhythmic impulse he gives to his songs. It is something new, mysterious, intriguing and challenging. Few people have a deep understanding of what Milton Nascimento’s music is.” Such extremes befit a man whose voice is one of the most profound in 20th-century music, one that entices and inspires his fellow countrymen as well as Paul Simon, Earth, Wind & Fire, Herbie Hancock, and Animal Collective. It’s a voice resonant and well-deep yet able to soar upwards to an ethereal falsetto, one capable of shaking vibrato as well as sustaining pure tones, and wordless shrieks closer to tropical bird calls than the human voice. Or, as Elis Regina once put it: “If God sang, he would do it with Milton’s voice.” Born in Rio in 1942, Nascimento’s mom died when he was still an infant and his adopted family relocated to Brazil’s Minas Gerais region when he was three. His adopted mother sang in a choir under iconic 20th-century composer Heitor Villa-Lobos and in the streets, Nascimento could hear church music, romantic toadas and folia de reis during Christmas season. Lingering from a 17th-century gold rush that brought in a flux of African slave labor to the Portuguese colony, the racial diversity of Minas Gerais yielded a rich spectrum of music (as well as racial tensions). As one of only a few black children in the small town of Três Pontas, Nascimento felt such intolerance daily. Yet he wholly absorbed the musical culture of his adoptive state of Minas Gerais and let it reverberate in his own songs throughout his long career. Obsessed with music though he was, Nascimento relocated to the capital city of Belo Horizonte in 1963 to take an accounting job. But he paid his bills by gigging in clubs at night, where he forged a close friendship with the Borges brothers, Márcio and his kid brother, Lô. With Marcio, he caught Francois Truffaut’s nouvelle vague classic Jules et Jim, watching it again and again until the last showing. Nascimento was inspired to start writing his own songs with his friend that same night. “All my songs are like a movie—they’re all very cinematographic,” he said. And it was through Lô that Nascimento first heard the Beatles, realizing just how classical music and pop could be fused together. Nascimento’s rise through the ranks of MPB was meteoric. A performance at the inaugural MPB festival in 1965 garnered notice and by ’69, he found himself booked at Rudy Van Gelder’s studio in North New Jersey, recording with producer Creed Taylor and helming a band that included fellow Brazilian jazz stars Eumir Deodato and Airto Moreira as well as Herbie Hancock. But it was when he was back home in Belo Horizonte, making small talk and jamming with his friends on a stretch of sidewalk at the corner of Rua Divinópolis and Rua Paraisópolis in the neighborhood of Santa Tereza that their “corner club” was born. Neither a club nor a movement at the time (a popular music venue now stands at the intersection), their “corner club” twined together various loves: bossa nova, the Beatles, psychedelic rock, Western classical, indigenous South American music, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and more. In 1971, Nascimento and friends rented a house in Praia de Piratininga to the east of Rio to pull their songs together and Clube Da Esquina was released the next year. A landmark of Brazilian pop, the success of the album confirmed Nascimento as a star of MPB but also launched the careers of Clube bassist Beto Guedes, guitarists Toninho Horta, Nelson Angelo and the younger Borges. And while Nascimento was by far the most prominent member of the club, his name isn’t on the cover and he shared credit with the then-20-year-old Lô Borges, who sings lead on six of the songs. Nor is Nascimento’s face easily seen; you have to hunt through the 150 photos in the gatefold to find a small photo of him. As MPB scholar Charles Perrone wrote: “Because of his extraordinary individual musical talents…the collective aspect of Nascimento’s repertory are often overlooked. Clube Da Esquina emphasizes the notion of encounter and the importance of gathering.” The magic of Clube Da Esquina is that while one can discern all of Nascimento and friends’ influences, their alchemy elevates it all to vibrate at a higher frequency. Casual and inspired, studied and spontaneous, the album is Pet Sounds, Innervisions and The White Album all rolled into one and it remains beloved even for those who know just a few Brazilian albums.  And even for those who don’t speak or understand a lick of Portuguese, the vocal harmonies, hooks, and orchestrations slip the confines of language and strike at the heart. So while you may not glean the lyrics of “Cais,” with its imagery of the sea, pier, and Nascimento’s plea for happiness, when the haunting ballad drops away at the 1:35 mark after singing about “launching myself,” a minor chord and his wordless harmonizing nevertheless conveys the bittersweet thrill of leaving the shore and drifting towards the unknown. You don’t need to translate the lyrics on “O Trem Azul” to feel the line about “the sun on your head,” so warm, languid, and tangible is its chorus. Same goes for the sensuous and ecstatic “Cravo E Canela,” which blends together sensations of caco honey and gypsy rain. The album is full of such shifts, moments that act like a refreshing breeze across the skin on a sweltering day, a shaft of sun piercing the clouds, a kind gesture on a crowded bus, reflecting how in our own daily lives the smallest of movements can trigger a reverberation within. In the lyrics, in the subtle switching of a meter, a key shift or a pivot in instrumentation, each song sets you down in a space far different from where you began. That sense of movement is intentional, as trains, roads, and modes of transportation often figure into Nascimento’s writing, and he himself considered his music “a kind of oxcart, something that unrolls and develops.” There’s the burred guitar build-up at the end of the otherwise hushed “Dos Cruces,” the clamor of church bells that punctuate and illuminate “San Vicente,” the mournful cello and strings in the middle section of “Um Girassol Da Cor De Seu Cabelo” that launches into a redemptive chorus about “a sunflower the color of your hair.” On the spare piano ballad “Um Gosto de Sol,” Nascimento moves through a half-forgotten dream, a stranger smiling in a foreign city, a river that falls to sleep, the sweet flesh of a pear, all of it tactile yet also ineffable. And then the minor key motif from “Cais” return, this time as a string quartet rather than piano and voice. It’s a surreal moment on the album, one worthy of Luis Buñuel, that image of the boat drifting from the pier now juxtaposed with a pear in a fruit bowl, the most poignant string section this side of “Eleanor Rigby” now reveals an underlying melancholy and sense of estrangement to the surface. Yet one of the album’s brightest, breeziest tunes led to Brazil’s federal censors originally blocking the recording of the song, an instance of a disconnect between the music and words. “Paisagem Da Janela” [Landscape From the Window] is clopping, country-tinged soft rock with a chiming guitar line, but Lô Borges’s refrain belies such lightness: “When I would speak of those morbid things/When I would speak of those sordid men/When I would speak of this storm/You didn’t listen/You don’t want to believe/But that’s so normal.” It speaks of a past that could also be a commentary on that moment under the rule of the junta. It’s also one of the album’s catchiest choruses, a natural for a sing-along. A military dictatorship trying to suppress such a song reveals that beyond the perfect pop songcraft and immaculate arrangements, Clube Da Esquina also signified the subtlest and most profound of revolutionary acts. “The military dictatorship imposed an element of urgency,” journalist Paulo Thiago de Mello wrote about the repressive political climate that surrounded Esquina. “And this is something that those who did not live those days may have difficulty understanding. The suffocation provoked by the dictatorship made life urgent.” Under such tyranny, the idyllic possibilities of youth are crushed. Be it Stalinist Soviet Union, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, or under the brutal military dictatorships that sprang up throughout the Southern Hemisphere in the ’60s and ’70s, social bonds are not just strained and severed, but also called into question. It’s no coincidence then that Nascimento references the Mexican Revolution hero Emiliano Zapata in the first minute of the album. “Totalitarian government, like all tyrannies, certainly could not exist without destroying the public realm of life…by isolating men,” wrote Hannah Arendt in her 1951 classic The Origins of Totalitarianism. “But totalitarian domination as a form of government is new in that it is not content with this isolation…It bases itself on loneliness, on the experience of not belonging to the world at all.” In hanging and playing together, Milton Nascimento and his friends provided a beacon in the midst of their country’s “vazio cultural” (or cultural void). Clube Da Esquina, the album itself and the subsequent movement, emphasized casual social encounters and the importance of getting together and playing, and as a result, it elevated not just Nascimento, but the entire collective. That spirit of collaboration continued for Nascimento well after, be it with saxophonist Wayne Shorter on the 1974 album Native Dancer that reintroduced him to a North American audience or his subsequent collaborations with everyone from Duran Duran to Pat Metheny to Quincy Jones. Such a sense of camaraderie and community can be heard in the brief, joyous minute and a half of “Saídas E Bandeiras Nº 2,” with Nascimento’s falsetto and the guitars arcing to their uppermost registers and towards a not yet possible but still imaginable future: “To walk down avenues facing up to what’s over our heads/To join all forces, to overcome that tide/What was stone becomes a man/And man is more solid than the tide.” In playing on the corner together, Nascimento and his friends—and even Tonho and Cacau sitting on a patch of dirt—all of them became the face of Brazil.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/milton-nascimento-lo-borges-clube-da-esquina/,Odeon,1972.0,"When one looks at the international music scene, a lot of attention gets paid to artists and bands from Anglophone countries. While there's no denying the global popularity of pop and R&B genres, it's worth remembering that those styles can mesh with regional sounds to create something truly special. That's exactly what happened with ""Clube Da Esquina,"" the iconic album from Brazilian musicians Milton Nascimento and Lô Borges. 

The story of ""Clube Da Esquina"" is as unique as the album itself. Nascimento and Borges came up with the idea while hanging out with fellow music-makers in an area of the city of Belo Horizonte known as the Clube da Esquina. It was the mid-1970s, and Brazil was still feeling the effects of a military dictatorship that had lasted two decades. In the midst of all that, the duo and their collaborators were inspired to create an album reflecting their country's melodic traditionalism and vibrant contemporary influences. 

The result, released in 1972, was nothing short of groundbreaking. You can tell how much Nascimento and Borges were pushing themselves both musically and lyrically. Nascimento's soaring voice, soaring guitar work, and accompanying arrangements were one thing, but the way Borges navigated between different styles and textures elevated the album even further. There's a hypnotic quality to the way the tracks segue into each other. In some ways, it feels like hearing snippets of several different conversations at once as Nascimento and Borges and their collaborators weave together so many different musical and cultural threads.

For me, the standout tracks on ""Clube Da Esquina"" are those where you really feel the experimentation and creative freedom in full force. ""Cais"" is a perfect example, with its gentle melodies and stripped-down instrumentation. You can also hear the influence of the Clube da Esquina collective on ""Um Girassol Da Cor Do Seu Cabelo,"" with its communal chanting and swelling brass tones. Even something like ""Cravo E Canela,"" with its swinging rhythms and sensual lyrics, feels effortlessly cool and confident.

Overall, I give ""Clube Da Esquina"" an enthusiastic 9.5 out of 10 rating. If you're a fan of global music or just want to experience something truly unique, this album is worth seeking out. It's a reminder of the power of collaboration, and how sometimes the greatest musical moments are those that come from pushing beyond boundaries and expectations.","Step 1: Both reviews provide a brief background of the album and the musicians behind it.

Miles Davis,The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions,Jazz,8.6,October 14 2003,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"In the spring of 1970, Miles Davis was fresh off his trailblazing, artistic watermarks In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew, and focusing on the development of his live show. His band included some of the greatest session musicians in jazz at the time: bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea, and drummer Jack DeJohnette, and all were helping Miles to push the musical ideas he'd introduced on his records into uncharted territory in concert. But he was also very much inspired by the concept of using recording studios as compositional instruments, and when he set out to create the soundtrack to an obscure documentary on boxing icon Jack Johnson, it turned out he had many more ideas than could possibly find their way onto two sides of a single LP. Following in the vein of Miles' recently issued Complete Sessions box sets for In a Silent Way or Bitches Brew (and featuring more raw material than either), this new five-disc collection shows a man consumed with evaluating the arsenal at his disposal. That meant recording countless takes on a theme, and, with assistance from producer Teo Macero, splicing those takes together into one coherent 40-minute release: 1971's A Tribute to Jack Johnson. But now, this compilation documents the sessions in their virtual entirety (there are a couple of missing takes, but nothing too essential), offering an incredible six hours of largely unheard material. As with the previous boxes from this era, fans will delight in hearing just about everything the musicians put to tape, as well as paging through the invaluable session info, extensive liner notes, and unseen photos included in the extensive and beautiful packaging. Obviously, though, anyone who hasn't heard and loved the original Jack Johnson album should check that out before dropping $60 on this exhaustive collection. Disc one opens with several takes from a February 1970 session of the misleadingly titled ""Willie Nelson"" (it is, in fact, a Miles Davis original)-- much of which was incorporated into the original LP's largely ambient piece ""Yesternow"". The band, which here features Miles, Corea, Holland, DeJohnette, bass clarinetist Bernie Maupin, and guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, set up a downbeat-heavy groove that reminds me of Funkadelic's ""Music for Your Mother"", if much less drugged-out. Davis enters about 40 seconds into ""Willie Nelson (Take 2)"" with a typically elongated phrase before settling into his ""jab"" motif with Maupin. Each take of the song offered here center around melodies similar to this one-- the real differences lie in Sharrock's, Miles' and Maupin's solos. It's a great way to kick off the set, if not quite as fiery a start as the original LP's ""Right Off"". Later that month, Miles reconvened with a smaller band, keeping his rhythm section fully intact, but trading in Sharrock, Corea and Maupin for 19-year-old saxophonist Steve Grossman. They recorded a couple of speedier takes of ""Willie Nelson"" that boast more colorful McLaughlin lines and Grossman's pleasantly spooky soprano. Miles also gives some great solos, even sporting some of his bebop chops at times-- sax player Gary Bartz, a member of Charles Mingus' Jazz Workshop and soloist on Miles' Live/Evil, said that some of the most exciting moments during the shows that eventually comprised the 1974 live offering Dark Magus were when Miles would reach back into history to pull out some of his old runs, and they certainly shine here. This band also tries out three versions of a tune called ""Johnny Bratton"" (previously unreleased, and starting the run of songs titled after boxers), a very rock-centric piece that sounds a bit like they were unsure of how to really nail this style. ""Johnny Bratton (Insert 1)"" is basically straight-ahead rock pounding (something like a fusion approximation of ""Louie, Louie"") with McLauglin doing his best to ensure that any tonal center is wiped out, and Holland entering with some admirable fuzz-wah bass playing. In early March, Miles again headed into the studio with this same band to cut ""Archie Moore"" and several versions of ""Go Ahead John"". The former tune is a hard blues number with some very potent lines from McLaughlin-- in fact, Miles and Grossman sit this one out entirely, allowing the trio to bring it home like a seasoned rock band. Five takes of ""Go Ahead John"" pop up on disc two, showcasing Miles' midnight cool melody. The first part is a sparse, somber exercise in minimal blues, and features McLaughlin reeling off short, staccato statements similar to the ones played by Sharrock on the first disc. The second part of the tune is an odd combination of jittery funk and acid-rock, with DeJohnette playing a prehistoric drum-n-bass pattern and Holland holding a single bass note while McLaughlin shreds on the right. All five performances were later edited into a version released on 1974's Big Fun. Mid-March saw Miles lay down two takes of the previously unissued ""Duran"" with McLaughlin, Holland, Maupin, soprano saxophonist Wayne Shorter, and drummer Billy Cobham. Miles' band was certainly getting a better idea of how to construct ""simple"" funk, as the basic, syncopated groove here could have been played (though never written) by any number of funk bands at the time. However, the robo-tight interplay of Cobham and Holland, along with McLaughlin's ever-edgy solos, make it much more interesting than just any ordinary breakdown. Miles reports, ""that's some raunchy shit, y'all,"" and he's right. These guys (exit Cobham, enter future Return to Forever drummer Lenny White) also did the stop-time, angular funk tune ""Sugar Ray"", which Bill Mulkowski's liner notes curiously describe as ""Devoesque"" and ""proto-punk."" It sounds more like The Meters playing head games to me. As April came around, Miles re-entered the studio with McLaughlin, Cobham, Grossman and Mike Henderson, a teenage bassist from Aretha Franklin's band, to record ""Right Off"" and the first half of ""Yesternow"". These two songs, of course, ended up serving as the tracklist on the original Jack Johnson LP, and anyone familiar with that record can attest to just how beautifully they pulled off ""Right Off""'s uptempo shuffle, with McLaughlin's aggressive outcomping transforming the track from a merely interesting jazz experiment to full-on streetwise fusion. Herbie Hancock dropped by the studio as well (from the grocery store!) and got talked into laying down a fuzz-fried solo on Farfisa, a kind of organ he'd never played before. The track ended up purely celebratory, and the four takes on disc three provide just about every solo angle you could want. The two lengthy takes of ""Yesternow"" offered here are masterful runs into electric ambience, but inevitably not quite as interesting as Macero's final album edit. In May, Miles added Keith Jarrett and percussionist Airto Moreira to the mix, cutting versions of ""Honky Tonk"" and ""Ali"". A short excerpt of ""Honky Tonk"" ended up on Live/Evil, but until now, the track has never been released in its entirety. Shame, too, because it's an excellent slice of blues-rock: Miles plays with confidence using an octave pedal while McLaughlin peals out still more spiky color for Jarrett to run rampant over. Considering that Jack Johnson would be Miles' last studio recording until On the Corner over two years later, it's hard to believe this song wasn't issued somewhere along the line. ""Ali"", leading off disc four, sees the same band (here including longtime Elvin Jones collaborator Gene Perla, who nicks a riff from Hendrix's ""Who Knows"") following a groove similar to that of ""Willie Nelson"", but with a much better idea of how to flesh it out. And then there's ""Konda"", which the guys recorded without a bassist at all, and which didn't see release until 1981's Directions compilation. Jarrett's opening solo on electric piano perfectly sets up Miles' eerie, beautiful melody, and McLaughlin's harmonic work is practically unearthly, helping to make this track one of the box set's coolest pieces. Miles followed this muse a few days later for takes on Brazilian composer Hermeto Pascoal's ""Nem Um Talvez"". Neither of the versions here are the one from Live/Evil, though the second is remarkably close. Miles wrapped recording in June, but not before taking most of the band from May's sessions (adding old friends Hancock and bassist Ron Carter) back into the studio for one last go at ""Nem Um Talvez"", three other Pascoal pieces (""Little High People"", ""Selim"", ""Little Church""), and another Davis original titled ""The Mask"". All of Pascoal's ballads seem to advance the side of Miles' music best heard on In a Silent Way, and serve notice to anyone who thought he'd abandoned that style for good at the turn of the decade. Unfortunately, ""Little High People"" is almost distractingly straightforward, at least in principal: The uptempo pop/rock groove brings Hancock's organ transmissions down to earth, and keeps Miles' wah-wah solos a bit too in check. Meanwhile, ""Selim"" (really just ""Nem Um Talvez"" with a different title) ended up on Live/Evil, along with the two versions of ""Little Church"" found on this set's fifth disc. Dave Holland came back to the fold to record both parts of the previously unreleased ""The Mask"": the first is a very out, keyboard-heavy free-jam with little assistance from Miles or McLaughlin, while the second-- hardly easy listening-- closes the sessions with an exhausted, punchdrunk swagger, finally collapsing after nearly 16 minutes. The box, however, ends on a high note, with the original LP versions of ""Right Off"" and ""Yesternow"". I hesitate to go through them blow by blow because anyone investing in this box will almost certainly have already heard them many times over. Which, ultimately, is my only real caveat to The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions: there's more of interest here to fans; for a casual listener to tackle all five discs would be commendably ambitious, but an arduous challenge nonetheless. This set ranks behind both the Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way boxes in terms of the amount of music I'd want to just let play, uninterrupted. However, Miles Davis is one of those rare musicians who rarely failed to let a take pass without trying out something cool. As usual, the deeper you dig, the more you find.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2200-the-complete-jack-johnson-sessions/,Columbia Legacy,2003.0,"When it comes to jazz legends, few names are as instantly recognizable as Miles Davis. One of the most innovative and groundbreaking musicians the genre has ever seen, Davis consistently pushed the boundaries of what was possible with his music. And nowhere is this more evident than on 'The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions'.

If you're a fan of Davis or jazz in general, you'll know that the late 60s and early 70s were a pivotal time for the genre. The infusion of rock and funk led to new sounds and ideas, and Davis was at the forefront of this movement. 'The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions' showcases this perfectly, highlighting Davis' incredible talent for bridging the gap between genres.

But first, a little context. 'The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions' is actually a reissue of Davis' legendary 1971 album 'Jack Johnson', which was originally intended as the soundtrack to a documentary about the boxer. While the film itself was never widely released, the music endures as one of Davis' most celebrated works. And with good reason.

This new release comes complete with alternate takes and unreleased tracks, providing listeners with a deep dive into Davis' creative process. It's fascinating to hear the evolution of these pieces, from early recordings to final album versions. You can really feel the experimentation and improvisation that went into the music.

Of course, Davis wasn't working alone. His backing band for this project included some heavy hitters in the jazz world, like Herbie Hancock, Steve Grossman, and John McLaughlin. Each musician brings their own unique style and talents to the table, resulting in a truly dynamic and impressive ensemble sound.

For me personally, 'The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions' is a shining example of what makes Davis so great. His ability to seamlessly blend styles and genres is nothing short of genius. There's a raw energy to this music that I find really invigorating, and I love how you can hear hints of rock and funk peppering the jazz undertones.

Overall, I'd give this album a solid 8.6 out of 10. If you're a jazz fan, it's an essential addition to your collection. And even if you're not typically a jazz listener, I'd encourage you to give it a try. There's something really special about Davis' music that transcends genres and speaks to a universal love of great music.","Based on the overall flow, language, and structure of the two reviews, it appears that Review B is the human written review.

Takka Takka,We Feel Safer at Night,Rock,5.6,November 7 2006,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"Y'know, most self-released albums don't even make it this far. Earlier this year, Brooklyn foursome Takka Takka started offering a free EP for download over the internet; by the end of September, dudes were playing for thousands at Central Park in support of full-length debut We Feel Safer at Night, opening for fellow unsigned word-of-blog heroes Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. The bands once shared a member, and both acts exemplify the way DIY musicians are using the web to reach their audiences. Unfortunately, a business model isn't an aesthetic, as anyone who ever tried to explain ""indie rock"" to a non-listener knows. We Feel Safer at Night, true to its title, is a safe, practically suburban NYC indie record for the bum-free, post-Giuliani era. Singer/guitarist Gabe Levine sing/speaks like a nice brah from Friends doing his best Lou Reed deadpan, backed by lulling Phoenix-meets-Counting Crows acoustic rock (sorry, not quite the Rembrandts). ""She Works in Banking"" uses a slick bassline and tingling soft-rock guitar suited for Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"", while ""Joshua and the Professor"" does choked-up goofball piano balladry in the earnest Ben Folds vein (Reinhold Messner, by the synths). But can they stand the sound of the Velvet Underground? Takka Takka also stick to what's safest and most widely palatable when it comes to lyrics. Like recent John Mayer single ""Waiting on the World to Change"", harmonica-laden ""Enough"" addresses the war in Iraq from a smug, uncontroversial distance: ""The protest kids are protestin'/ But they forget that the movement's been dead for years."" The topic gets a more direct treatment on ""Living Out of Trouble"", this album's ""Details of the War"" for its Dylan-drenched slo-mo, but the track never quite departs the coziness of cliché; Levine suggests we can't hear the gunshots because our TVs are on too loud. Yeah, dudes, I've kinda had enough of the blame-American-Idol-first crowd. It's tough to actively dislike these guys, though, when even they seem to realize how lucky they are. With Kinks la-la-las and handclaps, ""They Built You Up Too Fast"" could be a comment on the phenomenon of hype itself. ""I'll be sure not to say your name at all,"" Levine pledges over more acoustic guitars, as if safeguarding a beloved mp3 from the cred-besmirching white-earbud masses. It's the type of song bands could play in sports bars or nightclubs anywhere in the country. No one can say for certain whether Takka Takka's self-released debut would've even made it to New York if the band didn't already call the city home, along with most of their buzzed-about peers who aren't from Austin or Los Angeles. I thought the democratization of music on the internet was supposed to increase geographical diversity.  Apparently, we're all from the outer boroughs.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9575-we-feel-safer-at-night/,Self-released,2006.0,"When I first heard about Takka Takka’s new album ‘We Feel Safer at Night,’ I was curious to see how they would evolve as a band. The Brooklyn-based group has been around since 2004 and has a reputation for blending interesting rhythms and melodic songwriting. With this latest release, they prove that they still have something new to offer to fans of rock music. 

According to the band, they spent a lot of time together in a house in upstate New York, writing and recording the album. This explains the intimate atmosphere that pervades the record, as if you're listening in on a group of friends playing together. The end result is a cohesive body of work that gives the listener a glimpse into the emotions and motives of its creators.

The album kicks off with ‘Everybody Say,’ an upbeat, guitar-driven track with a catchy chorus that will have you tapping your foot. It’s a great way to set the tone and attitude of the record. ‘Fading Out’ then takes a softer, more introspective turn. The song draws you in with its intricate guitar work and dreamy vocals, before building up to a powerful climax.

‘When You Leave’ is another highlight of the album. The song showcases the band's songwriting prowess, with its intricate instrumentation and introspective lyrics. It’s a track that takes the listener on an emotional rollercoaster, from the soft, melancholy opening to the cathartic outro.

Throughout the album, Takka Takka plays with different textures and sounds, making it an engaging listen that keeps you hooked from start to finish. ‘We Feel Safer at Night’ is definitely for fans of rock music who prefer a more cerebral, nuanced approach to the genre. 

Overall, I’m impressed with this latest effort from Takka Takka. They’ve managed to blend different influences, sounds, and emotions into a cohesive album that speaks to their evolution as a band. While I do wish some of the tracks were a bit more dynamic and varied, the record is still a worthy addition to any rock music lover’s collection. For me, it's a solid 8 out of 10.","1.

The Atlas Moth,The Old Believer,"Metal,Rock",6.7,June 11 2014,Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,"The Atlas Moth's success has always come from compelling composites. Though they began as a formidable sludge outfit, the Chicago band’s old mold had broken by the time they recorded their second album, 2011’s An Ache for the Distance, which turned black metal torment into post-rock splendor, mid-tempo marches into alternate-universe alternative rock, and late-album comedowns into psychedelic dreamstates. Even the band’s personnel confirmed those polyglot tendencies; screamer Stavros Giannopoulos and singer David Kush traded guttural yells and grand refrains, conjuring incredible tension through variety and unpredictability. On An Ache for the Distance, you could hear the Atlas Moth sorting through a few dozen passions and touchstones on every song—from Deftones and My Bloody Valentine to the Allman Brothers Band and Neurosis. At any moment, their next move was always a question mark. The Old Believer, their first following three years of personal and professional turmoil, embraces many of those same sounds. “Collider” pivots between a great burst of swollen, righteous groove rock and prismatic psych, with elements of metals both blackened and doom at work, too. “City of Light” puts neon electronics beneath a stuttering, snapping beat, synthesizers undulating beneath the hook in a wonderful kosmiche haze. More than ever, the Atlas Moth depend upon the dynamic between Giannopoulos and Kush; they alternately take separate verses, nest opposing lyrics inside of one another’s voices and, during the album’s most dramatic moments, even sing together. The two-frontman approach suits The Old Believer’s the album’s fraught, searching content. Since An Ache for the Distance, Giannopoulos lost his mother and his girlfriend, Kush his grandfather, producer and guitarist Andrew Ragin his hips, and the band veteran drummer Anthony Mainiero. They explore self-doubt and existential quandaries, wondering about any afterlife and searching for an escape in the liquid drugs of South America. Near the end of the album’s most emblematic track, “The Sea Beyond”, Giannopoulos and Kush cycle around one another, Giannopoulos lamenting loss as Kush repeats “I know you’re always with me” as a maxim of self-assurance. Giannopoulos eventually joins him, the shouting and the singing perfectly and unexpectedly balancing despair and hope. But by and large, the Atlas Moth’s variety seems to have begot its own homogeny here, so that each move the band makes now feels like one you’ve either heard before or would have imagined upon prompting. Perhaps to accompany the more somber subject material, the Atlas Moth drift deeper into the shoegaze interests that have previously been only dalliances. The guitars hang low and loud, and twinkling keyboards fill cracks that spiderweb throughout the sound. More often than not, though, the softness mitigates the heaviness, or at least couches the blows until the impact all but disappears. Even when Giannopoulos is seething about dejection above surging guitars during “Halcyon Blvd”, the power seems padded, and the slow, steady wallop of “Hesperian” feels like a choice between the distortion of shoegaze and doom gone unmade, leaving the song to linger in the ineffectual middle distance. After the heavy touring cycle behind An Ache for the Distance, The Atlas Moth split with Mainiero, a dynamo capable of meeting and adding power to the band’s stylistic shifts. But part of the flat-line predictability here stems from Daniel Lasek, the new drummer who loves to find a mid-tempo beat and rarely leave it. For a band that’s flourished through a sense of whiplash, he’s an overly steady, cautious chauffer. The cover of The Old Believer depicts an alabaster-skinned woman in a matching white dress, blending into the walls like a camouflaged angel. She’s seated, staring calmly at the camera. But if you hold the cover beneath water for a few seconds, the scene goes hellish: The black walls of some dim chamber appear. She grows horns, and her eyes become black pits, a sanguine stain shaping a thin V beneath them, from her neck to her waist. For Profound Lore, the relatively scheme-free label that’s released the last two albums by The Atlas Moth, the trickery is tantamount to a picture disc or a limited-edition release. Designed by Ryan Clark, both images are beautiful, and the effect is chilling. It’s too bad, then, that the metaphor feels so off for The Old Believer. The Atlas Moth hope to be heavy and heavenly, aggressive and accessible, to exist in worlds of light and dark simultaneously. In this instance, they wind up in the shadows of their own intentions, hidden in flat gray instead of beautiful white or harrowing black.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19444-the-atlas-moth-the-old-believer/,Profound Lore,2014.0,"If you're a fan of the metal and rock scene, then The Atlas Moth's latest album, The Old Believer, is an absolute must-listen. With a rating of 6.7 out of 10, it's definitely not for everyone, but for those who appreciate intricate instrumentation, intense vocals, and a touch of psychedelia, it's a truly captivating work of art.

The Atlas Moth is a band with a rich history in the metal and rock scene. Formed in 2005 in Chicago, the group initially started as a instrumental duo, but quickly expanded to include vocals and released their debut album, A Glorified Piece of Blue Sky, in 2009. Since then, they've carved out a niche for themselves in the progressive metal sub-genre, pushing the boundaries of what metal and rock can sound like with each new release.

The creation story of The Old Believer is an especially interesting one. The album was partially inspired by the band's travels through Russia and the Middle East, where they were exposed to a variety of different cultures and sounds. This global influence is evident in the album's sprawling, often epic soundscapes, which incorporate everything from ambient noise to Middle Eastern and Indian instrumentation.

But what really stands out on The Old Believer is the band's musicianship. The instrumentation is nothing short of mind-blowing, with complex guitar parts, thunderous drums, and intricate bass lines all weaving together into a beautiful, swirling tapestry of sound. Vocalist Stavros Giannopoulos's voice is an intense, commanding presence throughout the album, adding an emotional depth to the already-powerful music.

To be sure, The Old Believer isn't an easy listen. It's dense and layered, and it can be overwhelming at times. But for those willing to dive deep into the album's intricate soundscape and allow themselves to be carried away by its intense emotions, The Atlas Moth's latest work is an absolute masterpiece.

Personally, I've always been a fan of the more experimental side of metal and rock, and The Old Believer is right up my alley. Listening to this album feels like embarking on an epic journey, with each song building on the last to create something truly exceptional. If you're looking for something new and exciting in the metal and rock scene, give this album a chance - it might just surprise you.","1.

Rogue Wave,Asleep at Heaven's Gate,"Experimental,Rock",6.9,September 14 2007,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"By now, Rogue Wave has had some time to get used to being a band. The quartet didn't actually debut until Rogue Wave's second album-- Zach Rogue recorded the first one, 2004's Out of the Shadow, mostly on his own. In the two years since Descended Like Vultures, the group has seemingly worked on honing a consistent sound for itself, and the result, Asleep at Heaven's Gate, is their dreamiest and loudest LP yet. The album has some sonic parallels with vintage Built to Spill, especially in the way the vocals are layered, but it's not quite as direct as that band's more classic rock-derived songwriting. Asleep at Heaven's Gate has a different, more pointedly ascendant feel from the outset. ""Harmonium"" is over six minutes of alternately drifting and pounding space-pop. The verses slip quietly along on Patrick Abernethy's echoing piano part, and the surrounding passages take a descending guitar motif to the rafters, with Pat Spurgeon hammering every beat with his kick drum, then later on the snare as Rogue and Gram LeBron lay down sheets of astral guitar. Those glittering passages are the blueprint for ""Chicago x 12,"" which ends with a cut-tempo coda featuring whale-song guitars and gets there with guitar- and keyboard-soaked verses powered by snares on every beat. The album's highlight comes with the vigorously strummed waltz ""Lake Michigan"", featuring Rogue's layered vocals singing a tumbling melody over an acoustic guitar and forcefully recorded drums. Clouds of clean-toned electric guitar and Wurlitzer float in the background, dripping with reverb. ""Christians in Black"", one of the album's two spare, pared-back tracks, brings the album's first half to a captivating, almost bucolic close, featuring little more than Rogue and some richly toned acoustic guitar. The problem with Asleep at Heaven's Gate is that the second half isn't nearly as strong as the first. ""Own Your Own Home"" sounds like it's working toward a big, majestic passage on its chorus, but instead of following through on the crescendo, the muscular drums and piano just drop back into the two-stepping verse, and ultimately, an unresolved coda. Closer ""Cheaper Than Therapy"" does manage to showcase some inspired guitar work, but the vocal melody goes nowhere. It's a shame the record falls off like it does, because Asleep at Heaven's Gate opens by promising a truly excellent album featuring a couple of Rogue Wave's best songs to date. It's not even that any of the tracks in the second half are bad-- just mostly unremarkable. Still, even taking the late fade into account, those who appreciated the first two Rogue Wave albums will find something here to like, and the best songs are worth anyone's while.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10667-asleep-at-heavens-gate/,Brushfire,2007.0,"If you're a fan of rock music that's pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the genre, you'll want to pay attention to Rogue Wave's ""Asleep at Heaven's Gate."" This experimental album is packed with surprises around every corner, and it's clear that the band put a lot of thought and energy into crafting something truly unique.

First, a bit of background on Rogue Wave. The band formed in Oakland, California in the early 2000s, and they quickly made a name for themselves with their upbeat, catchy indie rock sound. But over the years, they've evolved and changed, delving into more atmospheric and experimental sounds. ""Asleep at Heaven's Gate,"" released in 2007, is a perfect example of this shift in style.

The creation story of this album is an interesting one. According to the band, they spent months holed up in a remote cabin in the woods of Northern California, working on new material and experimenting with different sounds and instrumentation. It's clear that this isolation paid off in the final product, as ""Asleep at Heaven's Gate"" feels like a cohesive and thoughtfully-crafted project from start to finish.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Lake Michigan,"" which starts off slow and melodic, building to a powerful, almost symphonic climax. The song is an ode to the beauty of the natural world, and it's easy to get lost in the lush instrumentation and dreamy vocals. Another standout moment comes in ""Phonytown,"" which combines driving drums and distorted guitars with thoughtful lyrics about the pitfalls of American consumerism.

I'll admit, not every track on ""Asleep at Heaven's Gate"" hit the mark for me. Some of the more experimental moments felt a bit too indulgent at times, and there were a few instances where I found myself losing interest in the music. However, even when the album misses the mark, it's still a fascinating and ambitious piece of work that's worth spending some time with.

Overall, I'd give ""Asleep at Heaven's Gate"" a solid rating of 6.9 out of 10. It's not a perfect album, but it's certainly a compelling one, and fans of inventive rock music shouldn't sleep on Rogue Wave's experimental approach.","1.

Laura Marling,Semper Femina,Folk/Country,7.7,March 14 2017,Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,"Laura Marling has used conversations surrounding her sixth album, Semper Femina, to disavow music of “innocent creativity”—the kind that’s “not pointed, not political,” she says. It’s an intuitive concept that sounds relatively novel coming from this folk songwriter. In the late 2000s, Marling emerged from London’s Communion scene, a coterie of authenticity fetishists who wore wounded hearts on tweed-jacket sleeves. Marling was herself embroiled in “innocent creativity,” but she released masterpieces of the form. Her identity evolved from romantic pragmatist to underdog sage to mystic troubadour; her voice became distant and supercilious, baring just enough soul to reassure you one was there. Radical honesty is now common among young songwriters, but Marling can harbor guilt, fear, arrogance, deceit, or triumph in a bottomless deadpan. It’s easy to invest in her evasion. Semper Femina—Latin for “Always a woman,” and taken from Virgil’s epic poem The Aeneid—is no revolutionary screed. But the album’s characters, who are all given female pronouns, tiptoe outside Marling’s world of heartbreak and personal redemption. There are signs of a broader project at play. With lyrics about “warning signs” that we’re conditioned to “ignore diligently,” “Next Time” appears to preach a maternal fondness for Mother Earth: “I can no longer close my eyes/While the world around me dies/At the hands/Of folks/Like me,” she trills. While her composure hasn’t wavered since 2010’s I Speak Because I Can, there’s something new in songs like “Next Time” and “Don’t Pass Me By.” Both remind me, in their reserve and understated melancholy, of mid-career Elliott Smith—a chaotic and vulnerable individual anchored by a preternatural understanding of melody, using compassion to navigate horror. As Semper Femina’s questions deepen, answers rarely materialize. The gorgeous “Always This Way” mourns a friendship cut short in unexplained circumstances. As sorrow triggers a bout of soul-searching, Marling confesses, “Twenty-five years and nothing to show for it/Nothing of any weight.” Over pastoral guitar twirls, the narrator soothes herself with a mantra, though not a satisfying one: “At least I can say/That my debts have been paid.” The conciliation feels a little flimsy. A songwriter as meticulous as Marling doesn’t need to innovate, but she’s most intriguing on songs like “Soothing,” when her cryptic lyrics snowball without scrambling for narrative closure. “Soothing” is also the record’s only really ambitious composition. Interlocked basslines quarrel under Marling’s magisterial tones. Its image of a “creepy conjurer” whose “hands are in the door” hangs elegantly unresolved. She sings her sendoff—“I banish you with love”—through luscious minor notes that, instead of sugarcoating the rejection, transfigure it. Banishment becomes liberation, a generous act. The philosophy develops on “Wild Fire”: “There no sweeter deed may be,” she sings, “Than to love something enough/To want to help it get free.” As is Marling’s trademark, the line blossoms as both a revelation—the narrator takes pleasure in her wisdom—and a reprimand to a clingy partner, someone unsuited to her passionate independence. Where Semper Femina might have sketched a feminist utopia, Marling instead uses her broad study of femininity to explore flawed, sometimes devastating relationships between women. The full Virgil quote—“A woman is an ever fickle and changeable thing”—could seem patronizing, but Marling quotes it fondly on “Nouel.” She is tirelessly nuanced, and the result is an album filled with beautiful, searching observations on the psychology of friendship and occasionally romance. “I think your mama’s kinda sad/And your papa’s kinda mean,” she sneers on “Wild Fire.” “I can take that all away/You can stop playing it out on me.” Marling proposes here that love is a defense against our parents’ pathologies—yet she acknowledges that the traits we inherit are stubborn, determined to sneak in and mangle beauty. It’s a fitting parallel to how Marling wrestles with, and masters, her ever more malleable folk idiom.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22949-semper-femina/,More Alarming,2017.0,"If you’re a fan of British singer-songwriter Laura Marling, you know that this woman is a creative force to be reckoned with. Her latest album, Semper Femina, showcases her folk/country sound with a fresh and modern twist that fans of all ages can appreciate. 

One thing that makes Semper Femina stand out is its name - translated from Latin, it means “always a woman.” It’s a fitting title for an album that is all about the many dimensions of female identity. Marling once said in an interview that the phrase ‘Semper Femina’ was tattooed on her leg when she was 20, and so it has a personal connection to her life.

On this album, Marling explores the complexities of female relationships. Her lyrics touch on themes of love, friendship, rivalry, and sisterhood. “Wild Fire” is a personal favorite of mine, as it deals with the feelings of competitiveness that can arise between two close friends. It’s a relatable topic that many listeners can probably identify with, and Marling’s raw and honest writing style will have you nodding along in agreement.

Semper Femina was produced by Blake Mills, a producer and guitarist who has worked with the likes of Alabama Shakes and Conor Oberst. While the album definitely has a folk/country sound, there are some surprises thrown in as well. “Soothing” is a standout track that has an almost jazzy feel to it, with Marling’s voice floating effortlessly over the intricate guitar work.

Overall, I would give Semper Femina a solid 7.7 out of 10. While it’s not my favorite album from Marling (I’ll always have a soft spot for I Speak Because I Can), it’s definitely worth a listen. If you’re a fan of folk/country music or are simply looking for some beautiful and insightful songwriting, then Semper Femina should be on your radar.","Review A is the human written review.

Grand Ole Party,Humanimals,Rock,6.3,March 26 2008,Eric Harvey,Contributor,"A few years ago, when Kristin Gundred and John Paul Labno were jamming drummerless, the duo eschewed Craigslist-fishing for trap-work, and Gundred decided to hop behind the set herself. For a band trying to make noise in a crowded field playing basic blues-based pop-rock, moving the attractive female lead behind the most cumbersome instrument around was a gamble to say the least, but a few years later, it's starting to pay off. GOP's MySpace page fell under the sniffer of Rilo Kiley/the Elected's Blake Sennett, who saw potential enough to produce the trio's first full-length record Humanimals, as well as convince his manager Dave Holmes (who also handles Coldplay and Interpol), to release their debut on his DH Records. Once writers got wind of them, comparisons between the GOP and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs came fast and furious. At least superficially, there's something there: both are trios with a bold chick singer and two less-bold dudes, and both share a generalized orienting framework toward rock-- Nuggets-style blues-riff variations and howling female vocals. What separates the GOP from the YYYs is evident in the former's moniker, really: Instead of lacquering on the gallery grime and experimenting with texture and meter, Grand Ole Party's fifth-generation blooze is as uncomplicated and artless as nickel beer night or a sweaty, jam-packed house party. A lyric from the surf-rock inflected ""Belle Isle"" should give a good-enough idea of GOP's M.O.: ""How can the young things keep at bay/ The dark shadows, if they can't drink them away?"" The San Diego trio is certainly self-aware, as well, and wears its starkness as honesty. During the refrain of the call-to-arms ""Turn on, Burn on"", Gundred asks, ""Why can't we be simple, and enough to matter""? There's not much new on Humanimals, but its simple, spacious throwback rock is rendered ingratiatingly, recalling the re-energized greaser rock of Mink Deville and Richard Hell, with occasional hints of a boiled-down Pretenders in the cooed background vocals of Labno and bassist Michael Krechnyak-- especially on the catchy choruses to ""Insane"", ""Redrum Heart"", and ""Dirty Spirit Rag"". Lyrically, Gundred indexes the time-tested signifiers of rock-as-rebellion-for-lost-youth, her strained howl showing naïveté and toughness in equal parts. Humanimals' brassy opener ""Look Out Young Son"" casts her as the ""bastard child"" of ""rough love and abandonment,"" and ""Bad, Bad Man"" is a lesson learned: another Little Red Riding Hood caveat against men who would ""lead you down temptation lane."" As might be expected, Gundred occasionally veers off course from simple to simplistic, relying on moon-spoon-June rhyme schemes and iffy attempts at social comment. The chorus of ""Nasty Habits"" tells us that they not only ""make us who we are,"" but also ""take us very far,"" and the more ham-handed, Hell-in-a-handbasket nihilism of ""Insane"" offers a take on this thing called ""reality television,"" which apparently isn't very ""realistic"" at all. Ultimately, however, it's not the lyrics that stop Humanimals from rising too far above pleasant pastiche. Much more is GOP's resistance to doing what it seems built for: revving up to an explosion. Gundred's singing voice has tons of energy, to be sure, but it needs to mature past the blues-rock mirror stage to push the band into its own space. Sennett does a fine job of reining in Labno and Krechnyak to give the songs a sense of space and liveness, but I found myself on more than one occasion waiting for a big pop that never comes. Like thousands of singers before her, Gundred tries to start some shit on ""Turn on, Burn on"", recommending, ""let's just start a fire."" Despite GOP's kinetic energy, however, Humanimals stays a collection of smoldering embers that never fully ignites.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11292-humanimals/,DH,2008.0,"Humanimals by Grand Ole Party is a thunderous and rousing rock album with a unique twist. With a rating of 6.3 out of 10, the album delivers an absorbing experience that's both surprising and refreshing.

Grand Ole Party is a San Diego-based rock trio composed of a drummer, a guitarist, and a singer who also plays bass guitar. The band was founded in 2005 and quickly became known for their electrifying live performances and their penchant for blending rock with soulful blues and jazz elements.

Their latest album, Humanimals, was released in 2007 and features a collection of ten songs that showcase the band's versatility and artistic vision. The album was produced by Jason Hill, who's known for his work with Louis XIV and The Killers, and it reflects the band's collaborative approach.

The album's opening track, Look Out Young Son, is an unadulterated rock anthem that immediately sets the tone for the rest of the album. It's followed by Bad, Bad Man, which features an infectious bassline and soulful vocals that are both haunting and hypnotic.

The album's title track, Humanimals, is a standout, with its dueling guitar riffs and steamrolling drum beats. It's a boldly experimental track that combines elements of punk, rock, and blues music to create a dynamic and unforgettable sound.

The album also includes a more subdued track, Quiet Man, which slows things down and displays the band's ability to shift gears and tackle different musical styles. It's a tender ballad that shows lead singer Kristin Gundred's emotional range and sensitivity.

Overall, Humanimals by Grand Ole Party is a captivating rock album that's sure to impress fans of the genre. It's an album that's both raw and polished, with its frenetic energy and soulful melodies. If you're a fan of rock music, you won't want to miss this album.

In my personal experience, Humanimals transports me to a different time and place. Perhaps it's the band's fusion of rock with blues and jazz elements that creates a unique and invigorating sound that's both nostalgic and fresh. I find myself lost in the album's dynamic and immersive experience each time I listen to it.

All in all, Humanimals by Grand Ole Party is definitely worth checking out. The album is a true gem in the world of rock music, with a sound that's memorable and endlessly enjoyable. The band's creativity and artistry shine through in each track, and you'll be hard-pressed to find an album quite like this one.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed than Review B.

Hatchback,Colors of the Sun,Electronic,7.3,August 7 2015,Andy Beta,Contributor,"When the Weeknd premiered his latest single, ""Can't Feel My Face"", on Apple Music back in June, its discofied groove suggested both a ""Get Lucky"" retread as well as a sign that some eight years on, mid-'00s Scandinavian cosmic disco might have finally wormed its way from blog backwaters on through Cadillac car commercials and into the mainstream. How else to explain a handsome, remastered-at-Abbey-Road, heavyweight gatefold sleeve reissue of an obscure nu-disco album from California's Hatchback, first released to little regard in 2008? Originally released by Lo Recordings and !K7, Sam Grawe's debut Colors of the Sun has since been resuscitated by upstart UK reissue imprint, Be With Records, whose catalog ranges from yacht rock demiurge Ned Doheny to South African singer Letta Mbulu. But most fascinating are the albums that Be With zero in on from the '00s, when compact discs remained the medium of conveyance and pressing up vinyl was cost-prohibitive. So far, Be With has done vinyl reissues of everything from the Streets' A Grand Don't Come for Free to a Wilco side project to Cassie's prophetic minimalist nu-R&B classic. Where Hatchback's debut fits in amid this eclectic, baffling roster is hard to gauge. Even as a fan of everything nu-disco/Balearic of that era, I'm only familiar with Hatchback's music via a 17-minute remix courtesy of Prins Thomas (these remixes were almost de rigueur circa 2007). His music occasionally recalls the vintage keyboard squiggles of Prins Thomas & Lindstrøm or else that of Klaus Schulze. Perhaps Grawe's perspective from Northern California gives such German and European electronic influences a touch of sunshine and open air here, a surfer's mentality informing both his Hatchback persona as well as duo Windsurf. ""Everything Is Neu"" might wear its krautrock heritage on its sleeve, but rather than the Autobahn, it suggests a leisurely drive down the PCH, detouring from that motorik beat with piano-laced breakdowns suggestive of Michael Rother's post-Neu! albums. ""Comets"" and ""White Diamond"" both begin as Cluster homages, before Grawe astutely adds other layers—a laidback guitar figure, a contemplative synth melody—that take the tracks into more rarefied air. And had Boards of Canada decamped for the West Coast from Scotland, they might have made something like ""Closer to Forever"". In hindsight, it's easy to see how the album might have not gotten a fair shake, favoring low-key melodic turns and gentle movements rather than the grander moves of his contemporaries. Outside of a 2013 single, there hasn't been much heard from Hatchback since 2011's follow-up, Zeus & Apollo. A quick search turned up the fact that Grawe worked first at Dwell and now serves as editorial director for furniture manufacturer Herman Miller, whose ergonomic Aeron chair I'm currently sitting in as I type this. It makes a certain kind of sense that Grawe gravitated toward modern architecture and design, in that Colors of the Sun suggests an astute sense of craft, even if its expert design becomes almost imperceptible due to its functionality.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20852-colors-of-the-sun/,Be With,2015.0,"Colors of the Sun by Hatchback is simply a pure delight for all the electronic music lovers out there. From the soothing melodies to the upbeat grooves, this album offers a captivating listening experience that is sure to leave one feeling rejuvenated.

For those who are not well-versed in the band's history, Hatchback is the musical project of Brooklyn-based Samuel Milton Grawe. After a highly successful debut album, 'Colors of the Sun' comes as a much-awaited offering from the electronic artist. For this album, Grawe has incorporated several new elements into his sound that are sure to appeal to wider audiences.

What makes this album unique is the sheer range of sounds it incorporates. From the funky beats of ""Everything Is Neu"" to the ethereal soundscapes of ""Tarragona"" and ""Nesso"", Colors of the Sun has a little bit of everything for everyone. Blending elements of psychedelic rock with groovy synths and a touch of new-age ambient, this album is a true masterpiece that showcases Grawe's skill as a master sonic craftsman.

From the moment you press play, it is clear that attention has been paid to every little detail of this production. Each track is a journey in and of itself, transporting listeners to the clouds through spacey melodies, and then dropping them back down to earth with a forceful beat. It is an emotional trip, and one that is hard to forget.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""The Video Suite"", a sprawling eight-minute epic that unveils itself like a flower blooming in slow-motion. The track starts with a hauntingly beautiful guitar riff, before seamlessly morphing into a dreamy soundscape of synths and shimmering percussion. Listening to this track alone will leave you feeling like you've just witnessed something truly extraordinary.

Overall, Colors of the Sun is a fantastic album that showcases Hatchback's ability to blend a wide range of sounds and genres to produce a truly unique listening experience.

Suede,Night Thoughts,Rock,7.5,January 20 2016,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"Blackstar isn’t the only album released this month to take on added poignancy in the wake of David Bowie’s passing. Suede are releasing a new album mere weeks after Bowie did the same—just like in March 2013, when both parties released comeback records following decade-long hiatuses. And while the timing may be purely coincidental, it’s an uncanny circumstance for a band that, throughout the '90s, provided the most resounding reminder of Bowie’s early-'70s supremacy, and helped rehabilitate his rep amidst a career nadir for a new generation of pretty things. Listening to Night Thoughts now is like hearing a eulogy from a favorite son—from its quasi-conceptual structure to its stardust-speckled guitar riffage to its abundance of misfit anthems and concert hall-crumbling ballads, the record is a testament to Bowie’s steely determination to make every song a seismic event. That said, Suede are like the faithful scions who inherited the old family home, but didn't do much redecoration. They never shared their godhead’s flair for radical reinvention and experimentation; their discography effectively imagines an alternate 1975 where Bowie never went to Philly and continued to mine the dark majesty of the Aladdin Sane/Diamond Dogs era on through the '80s. The parameters of their sound were pretty much set with their first two albums—1993’s snappy, scrappy self-titled debut and 1994’s darkly ornate Dog Man Star—and the records that followed slid back and forth between those extremes. Bloodsports, their laudable 2013 return effort, hedged its bets by positioning itself smack dab in the middle of that spectrum, with the album’s invigorating first side balanced by a weightier second act. Their comeback now assured and their bravado fully restored, with Night Thoughts, Suede once again leap up off the dancefloor to swing from the chandeliers. Night Thoughts isn’t a rock opera per se, though it gamely assumes the form of one. Several songs bleed into one another through swirling interstitials; the opening track is reprised in the penultimate position, Sgt. Pepper’s-style; and it sounds like at least half the recording budget was spent on the orchestra. It’s also accompanied by a fitfully bleak feature-length film (directed by NME photographer/Libertines documentarian Roger Sargent) that shows a drowning man’s reminiscences about the familial tragedy that’s driven him to commit suicide in the sea. (The band previewed the album last fall with front-to-back live performances synced up to the film.) But the songs themselves don’t actually form a linear narrative arc, reference specific characters, or directly correlate to the visuals. They’re more discrete portraits of passion, ostracization, betrayal, and depression—hardly uncharted territory for a Suede record. But the sheer, fetishistic intensity with which Brett Anderson delivers his lascivious lyrics—coupled with the balcony-baiting, pomped-up performance of the band—makes the wounds feel newly opened and the bruises freshly pressed. That Night Thoughts’ cinematic companion piece centers around the story of an unglamorous middle-class family—rather than, say, the freakish, fashionable deviants that populate the band’s signature songs—underscores an essential truth about Suede today: They are no longer young people, and no longer speaking for them. Once the poster children for porcelain-skinned druggy excess, they’re now the embattled survivors sharing cautionary tales of bad decisions and dreams unfulfilled. Night Thoughts is framed by the opening ""When You Are Young"" and its late-album echo ""When You Were Young""—shore-crashing surges of symphonic psychedelia that dissipate into Anderson’s rueful ruminations about the idealism of youth and the impossibility of recapturing it. While the album’s title may hint at seedy suggestion, Night Thoughts is more about those traumatic, sleep-depriving memories that have you tossing and turning and ""tumbling out of a single bed."" It’s a record about addiction, to be sure, but to an intoxicant more elusive, potent, and damaging than any street drug: desire. And like any stimulant, the highs are ecstatic (see: ""Outsiders,"" a stained-sheet celebration of odd-couple consummation, or the nostalgically trashy ""Like Kids"") and the lows are crushing (see: pretty much everything else). The titles tell you exactly what you’re getting yourself into—""I Don’t Know How to Reach You,"" ""What I’m Trying to Tell You,"" ""Tightrope,"" ""I Can’t Give Her What She Wants""—each song more desperate and depraved than the one before, culminating in the latter’s intimations of violence (""The keys are falling from her coat/ As I weave my fingers around her perfumed throat""). Though a master of evocative detail, Anderson doesn't care much for narrative exposition—rather than set a scene, he prefers to thrust you into the thick of the moment where it’s all about to fall apart. And depending on your disposition, Night Thoughts concludes with either with a happy ending, or a dispiriting one. The swashbuckling, orchestro-ballad finale, ""The Fur & the Feathers,"" finds Anderson valorizing ""the thrill of the chase""—an optimistic suggestion that even the most bitter, agonizing breakup can’t diminish the rush of romance, or the brazen affirmation of a damaging, heart-ravaging habit that’ll inevitably lead to more sleepless nights. For the sake of Suede’s ongoing renaissance, let’s hope it’s the latter.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21417-night-thoughts/,Suede Limited,2016.0,"When Suede released their eponymous debut album in 1993, critics swooned over their blend of glam rock and Britpop, and their star power only grew with each subsequent release. So it's no surprise that 2016's ""Night Thoughts,"" their seventh studio album, delivers on all fronts.

The album was created with ambitious intentions - it was designed to be listened to as one continuous piece of music, with visuals and a storyline to accompany it in a feature-length film. This concept album is a meditative yet almost ominous exploration of the moments before and after one falls asleep.

As someone who has been a fan of the band since the 90s, I found ""Night Thoughts"" to be an impressive addition to their discography. It's a cohesive, well-crafted album that showcases frontman Brett Anderson's flair for storytelling and his bandmate's aptitude for nuanced instrumentation.

The opening track, ""When You Are Young,"" sets the tone for the rest of the album with its hauntingly beautiful melody and introspective lyrics. Anderson's voice, always distinctive and compelling, feels like an old friend coming back to tell me a new story. The instrumentation remains understated for the most part, allowing the focus to remain on the lyrics, but bursts of electric guitar and brass give the song a cinematic quality.

From there, the album never loses its grip on the listener. Every song has a unique mood and message. ""I Don't Know How To Reach You"" is a melancholy ballad with a hint of 80s new wave, ""No Tomorrow"" explodes with post-punk energy, and ""What I'm Trying To Tell You"" is a driving rocker full of passion and earnestness.

But the standout track, in my opinion, is ""Tightrope."" The lyrics poignantly capture the feeling of being teetering on the edge of darkness, while the soaring chorus provides a sense of hope and determination. It's a perfect example of Suede's masterful ability to craft anthemic, emotionally resonant songs.

Overall, I'd give ""Night Thoughts"" a solid 7.5 out of 10. It's a mature and cohesive album that shows Suede in top form, yet there's still room for growth and experimentation. If you're a fan of the band, this album is a must-listen. And if you're new to Suede's music, ""Night Thoughts"" would be a perfect introduction to their atmospheric rock.","1.

Glasser,Interiors,Electronic,7.8,October 10 2013,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"Manhattan's architecture results from the most rational possible pursuit of the irrational. That's one main argument of Delirious New York, a 1978 book by Dutch theorist Rem Koolhaas that Cameron Mesirow has named as an inspiration for her second album as Glasser. It's also a useful frame for understanding the record, not only its specific lyrical concerns but also its general spirit. Interiors is a methodical, computer-tethered expedition into the vast, wild expanse of human feeling. Glasser's 2010 debut Ring underpinned Mesirow's soaring vocals with free-flowing, rhythm-obsessed eclecticism that made for a notably welcoming collection of atmospheric, electronics-brushed pop. That description still largely applies to Interiors, but the homespun warmth and tribal rhythms of its predecessor have given way to chilly digital perfection—though plenty of organic elements persist, in a way that's crucial—and the album as a whole is more thematically unified. Mesirow's voice, both a singer and a songwriter, still towers over the proceedings, and you can look to this to orient you anytime the sonic and conceptual edifice grows too dizzying. Mesirow moved from Los Angeles to downtown Manhattan between albums, and the city she finds here is an Ableton Live-era update on sleek 20th-century modernism: Brancusi's ""Bird in Space"", in CGI space. Her Swedish co-producer Van Rivers, who also helped on Ring, applies his background in dark, shuffling techno and production credits from such albums as the Knife's Karin Dreijer Andersson's self-titled 2009 solo album as Fever Ray. The nod toward heady electronic music is nothing entirely new from Glasser, who has been remixed by the likes of Jamie xx and Lindstrøm, but she credits her collaborator for helping carry out her blueprints. ""I was like the designer, and he was the architect,"" Mesirow told Billboard. Glasser's first widely circulated song, 2009's ""Apply"", meditated on the permeability of walls and windows, and Interiors' rooms, too, are rarely as hermetically sealed as a cursory listen might suggest. ""Shape"", the opening track and first advance track, introduces the LP's silvery, aerodynamicism with whooshing bass and crisp kick drums, but Mesirow's layered, melismatic vocals are front and center—and she's describing not a city skyline, but an ocean beach. While ""Exposure"" glitchily theorizes on the ""modern trouble"" of urban living, Mesirow is far more likely to use her fabricated sonic setting as a framework for exploring personal demons: The bird calls and tropical tinges on ""Dissect"" signal a lingering stylistic connection to labelmates Tanlines, but next to lyrics about being ""shackled to a window/ Anything but open,"" they also point to her much-reported struggles with spacial anxiety. The interiors Glasser explores most compellingly are, it won't surprise you at this point to learn, the ones within human beings. She applies the same ruthless precision to these ostensibly messier subjects, so that video selection ""Design"", an examination of physical desire that wields human breaths as percussion, is crystalline enough for a posh gallery. But the insides of people turn out to be at least as unknowable as those of buildings: ""Keam Theme"", an uptempo standout, opens with a dream sequence and carries on from its oblique title to ask, ""How long before I know you?"" It might just be me, but something about the hook brings to mind Arthur Russell expressing a similarly surreal, slightly different sentiment decades ago: ""That's us, before we got there."" This is ultimately where Glasser manages to communicate the unknowable—in the way her meticulously arranged soundscapes convey a sense of place even when their literal meaning might be just out of grasp. ""I'm in your landscape, and I don't wanna go back to mine,"" Mesirow intones between rippling synths, sinuous orchestration, and percussive crunches on ""Landscape"", a song that closes with an out-of-nowhere, live-sounding drum-and-keys groove reminiscent of Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder brain trust. It's a track that contains so many of Interiors' paradoxes: the push and pull between 1's and 0's and flesh and blood, between indoors and outdoors (""There's nothing here but walls, walls, walls""), and between two lovers. Mesirow has also cited Beyoncé as an inspiration, but although a few of the lither moments bring to mind the future-soul of Little Dragon, her closest parallels on Interiors remain big-idea, big-voice art-poppers such as Bat for Lashes or Björk. Indeed, if the album errs in a particular direction, it's in leaning a bit too heavily on abstraction without anything that lowers its barriers quite as far as, say, ""Laura"", from Bat for Lashes' 2012 The Haunted Man. A three-part ""Windows"" suite, presented out of order, brings in fractured sax bleats and ambient textures, but it's more difficult to unlock than its title might hint, and overworked lyrics like ""listlessness becomes a habit"" occur a little too often throughout the album. Koolhaas, author of Delirious New York, later decided it was time to ""kill the skyscraper."" Glasser has built a dazzling one, but you figure she just might know the feeling.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18602-glasser-interiors/,True Panther,2013.0,"Glasser's ""Interiors"": Exploring the Boundaries of Electronic Music

In Glasser's latest album, ""Interiors"", the Brooklyn-based musician explores the boundaries of electronic music in a way that is distinctly her own. As an avid listener of electronic music, I was excited to listen to this album and see what Glasser had in store.

Firstly, it's important to know a bit about Glasser's history. Born Cameron Mesirow, she adopted the moniker Glasser for her music career. She's known for her unique approach to electronic music, often incorporating tribal rhythms and unconventional instrumentation. Her debut album, ""Ring"", received critical acclaim in 2010, and she's been building on her unique sound ever since.

Now on her third album, ""Interiors"", Glasser continues to deliver her signature style while also pushing the boundaries of electronic music. In an interview with Pitchfork, Glasser explained that the album's concept was inspired by the work of architect Adolf Loos, who believed in the power of minimalism and simplicity in both design and life. Glasser wanted to explore this idea in her music, stripping away any unnecessary elements and focusing on the essentials.

Listening to the album, it's clear that Glasser succeeded in this vision. ""Interiors"" features sparse instrumentation that is both haunting and beautiful. The opening track, ""Shape"", sets the tone for the entire album with its eerie chanting and slowly building percussion. Throughout the album, Glasser's vocals are reminiscent of ethereal chants, adding to the otherworldly atmosphere.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Design"", which features a complex blend of layered synths and African-inspired percussion. The track has a hypnotic quality to it, taking the listener on a journey through different soundscapes.

While the album is undeniably beautiful, its minimalism does lend itself to a certain lack of variety. Some tracks, such as ""Primrose"", can blend into the background if not given the proper attention. However, Glasser's ability to blend the spiritual and the otherworldly is impressive and makes ""Interiors"" a unique experience.

In conclusion, Glasser's ""Interiors"" is a thought-provoking exploration of minimalism in electronic music. While it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate the beauty in simplicity will undoubtedly love this album. With her unique style and intricate soundscapes, Glasser proves herself to be a boundary-pushing artist in the world of electronic music. I would give this album a solid 7.8 out of 10, and would definitely recommend giving it a listen.","1.

Various Artists,Underwater Peoples Winter Review,,7.3,January 19 2010,Zach Kelly,Contributor,"Having personality and being personable are two very different things. For a small, niche-centric indie label like Underwater Peoples-- the D.C. collective responsible for nurturing some of the finest examples of 2009 lo-fi-- possessing both of these characteristics is paramount. Reach back to last June's Underwater Peoples Records Showcase (the first installment of what appears to be a kind of bi-annual mixtape giveaway), and you'll find a group of shaggy young artists huddled around a sound that would, in some circles, define a small chunk of last year. Take a minute to peruse the label's blog (or sometimes more helpfully, UP's sister-blog Chocolate Bobka) and you'll find a convivial comraderie amongst handlers, fans, and bands-- a genuine congregation of friends rotating in-and-out of a stable of mostly solid acts. In the case of this second spotlight LP, Underwater Peoples Winter Review, a handful of forward-thinking tunes helpfully draws the focus in over the cozy, close-knit sounds that anchor the label so well. Here, these freshly ordained acts prove Underwater Peoples is not just the house that Real Estate built: In most instances, each new Winter Review artist that didn't appear on Records Showcase outshines the returning familiar faces. That's not to say there aren't highlights from Underwater Peoples' first wave-- Real Estate, Julian Lynch, and Liam the Younger all contribute excellent tracks that reinforce their patented sounds without much fuss or reinvention. But it's the varied collection of burgeoning outfits like Appalachian gospel maidens Mountain Man, sharp-fuzz shoegazers Big Troubles, and minimalist pop advocates Fluffy Lumbers that put up stuff so crisp and clever it almost devalues some of the same-sounding material from the smaller roster vets. It makes for some expected unevenness, but more importantly provides proof that the folks at UP have great sets of ears. While Records Showcase worked best at ""establishing a seasonal mood"" (as Pitchfork's Joe Colly mentioned last summer), Winter Review hinges less on trying to approximate the chillier extremes that mark this season. However, the wintry exceptions are often standouts: Julian Lynch's opener ""Es's"" is a delicate, crystalline swirl of synthesized flute and keyboards; Fluffy Lumbers' (Frat Dad's Samuel Franklin) ""Adoration"" culls mystic boogie from some warm, fictional Fleetwood Mac B-side heard from two rooms over. And while there is an errant chill in Mountain Man's ""Dog Song"", a bewilderingly lovely number from the all-female Vermont trio, its frightening foothill-harmonies prove perennially awing. Still, what's more important here is that the compilation succeeds when at its most distinct and inventive; failures can largely be attributed to a sort of general homogenization of the label's stock and trade. It's not that the sameness isn't welcome when applied properly: Real Estate's ""Orchard"" is a pretty, country-fried jam; Pill Wonder's ""Restless"" boasts woozy string clips that melt into a pleasantly churchy mid-tempo waltz; Liam the Younger's terrific closer ""Please See"" transforms a shy acoustic plea into a bright, Arcade Fire-like life-affirmer. But entries like Frat Dad's ""Totally Afraid"" (which sounds like a teenager's idea of an ironic Doors cover) or Real Estate bassist Alex Bleeker's ""These Days"" (the perfect soundtrack to watching your dad set up his brand new Margaritaville® blender) feel soggy up against more assured songwriting. Like, for instance, Air Waves' rolling strummer ""Sweetness"", a bright piece of folk-pop that sounds practically hi-fi in relation to everything else. It's in these moments we can see the real value in branching out-- however hospitable and homey Underwater Peoples needs to be, it's personality that goes a long way. And Winter Review has characters to spare.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13824-underwater-peoples-winter-review/,Underwater Peoples,2009.0,"Are you tired of the same old music on the radio?

Danger Mouse,26-Inch EP,Rap,6.1,May 18 2004,Rollie Pemberton,,"There are few things more difficult than recommending an EP. The concept of the extended player is adverse to positive results in either of its two incarnations: the fully-realized EP that is developed to display a genuine change of direction for an artist, or the EP that bunches together several oddities or remixes in a grab for additional spending. In the case of Danger Mouse and Jemini's newly reissued (and repackaged) 26 Inch EP, the collection unfortunately leans closer to the latter. The talent is here, although the cast of characters don't seem to have much of interest to say. Repeated verses from The Alkaholiks, as well as Cee-Lo's decision to forgo rapping entirely to sing the chorus of ""What U Sittin' on Remix"" are early disappointments, while Sadat X phones in a stilted verse on ""Ghetto Pop Life Remix"", continuing the trail of missed opportunities. Jemini's new verses, too, while strongly delivered, are lyrically disappointing: He spends ""The Shit"" praying to the god of self-aggrandization, who is described not only as ""the shit,"" but also ""the boss,"" ""a bad motherfucker,"" ""the Incredible Hulk,"" and, on a particularly good day, ""the Son of God."" ""Ghetto Pop Life II"" is the disc's strongest remix, giving the anthemic original more of an A.M. radio overhaul. Light string flourishes and subtle keyboard wash over the listener, while Jemini juxtaposes quickly spun, low-toned verses with soulful crooning reminiscent of The Pharcyde. And he kills it, too: ""Some might question my openness/ I'm not your average mediocre local vocalist."" The thing that sets this song apart from the others on the EP is the way in which elements of the original remain in the remix, while all others are altered beyond recognition. The immediate production standout comes with ""Omega Supreme (DM Remix)"". Although lacking any new vocal treatments from Jemini, Danger Mouse flips the original song on its head by chopping 80s piano-funk with ridiculous timing, precisely layering in extra drums for variety, tossing in a two-bar change-up near the end of the verses, and otherwise wholly reinventing one of Ghetto Pop Life's best cuts. It almost singularly makes up for other more disappointing moments over the course of the EP-- a good sign for any remix. Viewing the album from the lens of the more involved EP style, 26-Inch fails to show any development from Jemini, and generally just allows Danger Mouse to experiment with different sounds. I'm hoping that Jemini takes to the topical variety he doled out on the group's preceding full-length, and chills out on the singing when he unveils his upcoming Kill Your Heroes LP later this year.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2518-26-inch-ep/,"Lex,Lex",2003.0,"If you're a fan of rap music, you may want to give Danger Mouse's latest album, ""26-Inch EP,"" a listen.

He's produced music for the likes of Gorillaz, The Black Keys, and Beck, among others. So, it's no surprise that ""26-Inch EP"" carries the same level of creative ingenuity that we've come to expect from the artist.

The album is a collection of six tracks, each with its own distinct sound and vibe. From start to finish, ""26-Inch EP"" is a dynamic and experimental journey through the rap genre. One thing that is particularly notable about the album is the eclectic mix of sounds featured throughout. Danger Mouse has a knack for blending different styles and genres together with ease, creating a unique and surprising listening experience for his fans.

One standout track on the album is ""Nodding Off,"" featuring rapper J.I.D. The song is a slow burn, with a hazy beat and smooth flow that perfectly complements J.I.D's rhymes. It's the kind of track that you want to listen to on a warm summer night, as you watch the stars twinkle in the sky.

Another notable song on the album is ""Parisian Goldfish (Remix)."" The track, which is a nod to a track by Flying Lotus, is an upbeat and energetic banger that will have you on your feet and grooving in no time. Danger Mouse's production on this track is particularly impressive, with a clever use of vocal samples that add a fun and playful vibe to the song.

In terms of personal experience, I must say that ""26-Inch EP"" wasn't exactly what I was expecting from a rap album. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. I appreciated the fact that Danger Mouse was taking risks and experimenting with different sounds and styles, rather than simply following the cookie-cutter formula that so many other rappers are using these days.

Overall, I would recommend ""26-Inch EP"" to anyone who is looking for something new and exciting in the rap genre. While it may not be for everyone, there are definitely some standout tracks on the album that are worth giving a listen. And who knows, you may just discover a new favorite artist in the process.","1.

Madlib,Beat Konducta Vol. 5-6,Rap,8.3,March 6 2009,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Another month, another meditation on the legacy of James Yancey. It's been three years since Yancey's untimely death and his grip on the imagination and inspiration of hip-hop artists still hasn't loosened-- and somehow, for the most part, hasn't crumbled into exploitative shamelessness. You can chalk that up to most of the tribute-paying artists-- Q-Tip, Common, Busta Rhymes, Talib Kweli, ?uestlove, Erykah Badu, damn near every hip-hop artist in Detroit-- having known and respected the man on a collaborative level (and, in the case of Yancey Boys' Illa J, as family). Madlib's own personal musical tribute to Dilla is particularly faithful: They were two producer-MCs who had forged a mutual stylistic compatibility, one that began with beat-tape trading by mail and resulted in the underground classic Champion Sound, and in that album's wake they both wound up inspiring and pushing each other to expanded vistas. Donuts might have sounded like a drastically different album without the choppy, grimy aesthetic of The Unseen and Madvillainy's production mind as a creative sparring partner, and Madlib's early Beat Konducta work, the creation of which ran largely parallel to the construction of Donuts, benefited greatly from his study of Dilla's meticulous drum and bassline construction. Among all the things that were lost to hip-hop heads with Dilla's passing, the possibility of future collaborations and stylistic cross-pollinations between these two beatmaking auteurs was one of the most significant. As an elegy, a payment of a gratefully-acknowledged artistic debt and an expansion of one man's sound, the fifth and sixth volumes of Madlib's Beat Konducta series are a stirring culmination of everything Dilla did to affect Madlib as a musician. Granted, there's little mistaking it for anyone other than Madlib: There's a constant volley of vocal snippets, lyrical and otherwise, that fit his thematic blend of fragmented quasi-narrative and off-kilter humor. Plus, his restless, loop-jostling production style is instantly-recognizable here in one of its most dubbed-out, bass-heavy and atmospherically THC-soaked incarnations yet. Still, the Dilla influence is clearly evident in a number of ways, especially the way vocals are chopped and truncated to serve as melodic hook, percussive exclamations, and reconstructed grooves for several tracks, as well as the recurring presence of that weighty, synthesized bass Dilla loved to lace his tracks with. And there's a few other flourishes-- like the air-raid siren that popped up every so often on Donuts, or the ""Make It Funky"" clip of James Brown saying ""I don't know"" used on the Slum Village track of the same name-- that range from obvious nods to what seem like elaborate in-jokes between friends. At 42 tracks stretched across 67 minutes, this looks a bit like an unwieldy collection of fleeting ideas when the tracklisting's all splayed out in front of you. And it's a bit difficult to get a firm grasp on everything, even after several listens: There's just so many ideas Madlib's managed to cram into even the shortest minute-long loop that it's hard to point to a particular track and highlight its characteristics without taking the rest of the album into account. There's some particularly inspired standout moments that'll stick with you: the soul strings that get hacked up into hiccupping, off-beat tics on ""The String (Heavy Jones)""; the way ""The Get Over (Move)"" actually welds the guitar riff from the Buzzcocks' ""Boredom"" to an archetypal Yancey boom-clap and somehow makes it make sense; the muffled/smothered beats on ""Smoked Out (Green Blaze Subliminal Sounds)"" where nothing's clear or amplified except a persistent tambourine slap. But this isn't an album that benefits from a track-by-track dissection or a thorough inventorizing, even if the bulk of the beats sound attention-grabbing enough when they pop up as individual moments in a divorced, shuffle-mode context. More than any other collection of semi-instrumental productions Madlib's assembled, the combined Dil Cosby Suite and Dil Withers Suite is a complete work. The best way to listen to this album is to throw it on, zone out and keep your finger away from the controls, letting the rhythmic detours and left-field segues sneak up on you before dissolving into the next beat (abetted, every so often, by some sparse but well-placed scratches from guest turntablist J-Rocc). Before long you'll click with its flood of sounds and ideas and emotions, and the everywhere-at-once scope-- mournful and celebratory, solemn and comedic, starting from soul and circulating its way through every other vein of hip-hop production structure. Three years later, after all the eulogies for Dilla, this record stands as one of the most meaningful.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12772-beat-konducta-vol-5-6/,Stones Throw,2009.0,"If you're a fan of rap and haven't already checked out 'Beat Konducta Vol. 5-6' by Madlib, then you're in for a treat. This long-awaited album, released in 2009, showcases the producer's immense talents in the field of beat-making, and it's a testament to the incredible influence he's had on the rap scene over the years. So, let's dive right in and explore what makes this album so special.

Madlib (born Otis Jackson Jr.) started his rap career in the early 1990s, and has since then become one of the most respected artists in the industry. He's known for his diverse range of artistic influences, including jazz, funk, and soul, and he's also famous for his experimental approach to production. In 'Beat Konducta Vol. 5-6,' Madlib showcases his prodigious skills in sampling and sound manipulation, taking us on a unique journey through the world of rap.

One fascinating aspect of this album is the story of its creation. As the title suggests, 'Beat Konducta Vol. 5-6' is part of a series that started back in 2006. Madlib's idea was to create a collection of beats inspired by the late J Dilla, who was one of his biggest influences. Unfortunately, J Dilla passed away due to complications from lupus in 2006, so Madlib dedicated the rest of the series to him. The result is a beautiful tribute to one of the greatest producers in the history of rap.

So, what about the music itself? Well, 'Beat Konducta Vol. 5-6' takes a very different approach to rap music than what we're used to. The album is instrumental, meaning that there are no vocals on it. Instead, Madlib relies solely on his production skills to create a unique listening experience. And boy, does he deliver! The beats on this album are simply phenomenal, ranging from soulful and jazzy to gritty and raw. Every track is a masterclass in beat-making, and there are so many layers to the music that you can listen to it over and over again and still discover new things.

One of the things I love about this album is that it's incredibly versatile. You can use it as a background soundtrack while you work, or you can really dive into it and analyze every sound and sample that Madlib has used. Either way, you're in for a treat. I've personally listened to this album countless times, and it never gets old. There's just something about the way Madlib layers his beats that makes them so addictive.

In conclusion, 'Beat Konducta Vol. 5-6' is a shining example of Madlib's immense talent as a producer. It's an album that pays homage to one of the greatest artists in the history of rap, while also showcasing Madlib's unique approach to beat-making. If you're a fan of rap, jazz, or just good music in general, you owe it to yourself to give this album a listen. With a rating of 8.3 out of 10, it's definitely worth your time.","1.

Spiral Stairs,The Real Feel,Rock,5.2,October 20 2009,Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,"It's not mandatory for great bands to balance a dominant vocal personality with a foil, but it makes sense that it happens so often. A good No. 2 doesn't need to be less interesting than the star-- Flavor Flav is surely a more magnetic figure than Chuck D, for example-- but at best, they establish a necessary contrast that casts the lead in sharper relief. The star shines brighter, the subtext runs deeper, and the emotional range gets broader. In indie rock terms, think of how Kim Deal's easy-going stoner femininity emphasizes Black Francis' tightly-wound nerd masculinity, or the way Lee Renaldo's hipster everyman style offsets the larger-than-life personae of Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon. Pavement may not have had a vocal dynamic as profound as Public Enemy, the Pixies, or Sonic Youth, but Stephen Malkmus had his appropriate foil in the form of Scott ""Spiral Stairs"" Kannberg. Spiral was no less shambling and inscrutable, but he was very good at playing the self-effacing underdog to Malkmus' nonchalant indie alpha male. It would be an error to label his songs as more ""sincere""-- he was consistently a far more cryptic and opaque lyricist than SM-- but he was capable of projecting a nervous vulnerability that destabilized the freakishly self-assured vibe of Pavement's first four albums in a way that was positive and necessary. Even if Spiral Stairs was not crucial to either Pavement's appeal or Malkmus' success, his presence offered a subtle balance and contrast, and yielded at least a few classics: ""Kennel District"" from Wowee Zowee; ""Date With Ikea"" from Brighten the Corners. In the time since Pavement's dissolution in 1999, Kannberg has stepped into the role of the frontman with mixed results. Despite the nod to George Harrison's All Things Must Pass in its title, his debut as the leader of the Preston School of Industry did not reveal him to be an extraordinary songwriter obscured by the flash of his former partner, but rather just a serviceable author of amiable but not especially interesting indie rock. He pushed himself further by embracing alt-country on the follow-up, Monsoon, but the record was a tuneless, dreary mess, and it is undoubtedly the worst release ever to be associated with anyone having to do with Pavement. The central problem with the Preston School of Industry albums is that the very things that made Kannberg an effective foil for Malkmus also made him exhausting and dull as the focal point of a band. Whereas he was once the Milhouse Van Houten to Malkmus' Bart Simpson, he had devolved into being an incoherent indie equivalent of Milhouse's dad mewling ""Can I Borrow a Feeling?"" After a five-year hiatus from recording, Kannberg has dissolved the Preston School of Industry, or perhaps more accurately, rebranded the project as Spiral Stairs. This is a sensible decision. Preston School of Industry was a terrible name for a band, and Spiral Stairs was always one of the better stage names in alt-rock. The reversion to the Stairs moniker could be taken as a signal that Kannberg has returned to form, but anyone expecting anything along the lines of his Pavement tunes will be let down by the contents of The Real Feel, his first record under the name. Kannberg's new music mostly takes its cues from Neil Young and mid-period Bob Dylan, and to a certain extent, the ragged yet expansive sound suits his strengths as a guitarist and his weaknesses as an often aggravatingly nasal vocalist. ""True Love"", the album opener, is confident and sharp despite feeling more than a bit generic, and tracks like ""Maltese T"" and ""Cold Change"" are minor works, yet successful on their own terms. Even the weakest cuts on The Real Feel are at least passable genre exercises, but at a point it becomes difficult to tell whether they are actually good faux-Neil Young songs, or if these tunes would have any appeal at all to listeners who were not hardcore Pavement fans with an unusually large amount of goodwill for the band's less famous founding member. Though he is still prone to writing nonsense lyrics nearly devoid of resonance, Kannberg has opened up significantly as a lyricist, though his most emotional and unguarded moments on ""Call the Ceasefire"" and ""Blood Money"" are mostly quite banal. Unlike many of his previous works, he seems far more interested in revealing himself and connecting with an audience, but even though his voice has grown stronger, he still sings everything as if he can't stand to make eye contact with you. The music is a clear step up from his nadir on Monsoon, but it's only a lateral move in terms of quality compared to the first two Preston School releases. His style may shift, but Kannberg remains an unambitious songwriter and underwhelming frontman. It could just be that he's the type of person who best thrives as a second banana. Then again, maybe all he needs is a foil of his own.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13547-the-real-feel/,Matador,2009.0,"Spiral Stairs’ 2017 release, ‘The Real Feel’ is an intriguing mixed bag in the rock genre. The album, with a rating of 5.2 out of 10, offers glimpses of brilliance throughout, but ultimately leaves much to be desired.

Before delving into the music itself, let’s first explore the band's history. Spiral Stairs is the side project of Pavement founding member Scott Kannberg, who decided to pursue his own musical venture after the band split in 1999. ‘The Real Feel’ comes nearly a decade after the release of the band's previous album ‘The Real Feel’, and also sees Kannberg collaborate with fellow musicians like Matt Jorgensen and Ian Dickson.

The album’s creation story is an interesting one. Kannberg was inspired to create this album after losing his father and experiencing the birth of his second child. This personal journey is evident throughout the album, as it ebbs and flows with themes of grief, love, and loss.

The album begins promisingly enough, with the track “Dance (Cry Wolf)”. The opening guitar riff is catchy and energetic, and the chorus is satisfyingly anthemic. “Emoshuns” is another standout track, with its jangly guitar and catchy lyrics that are sure to get stuck in your head.

However, as the album progresses, it becomes clear that the album has some flaws that keep it from being a truly exceptional piece of work. The middle part of the album particularly struggles to find its footing, with tracks like “AWM” and “Trams (Stole My Love)” feeling underdeveloped and lacking in creativity.

That being said, there are also moments of brilliance that cannot be ignored. “Exiled Tonight” is a standout track, with its driving beat, intricate guitar work, and emotive lyrics. “Angel Eyes” is also a pleasant surprise, with its dreamy soundscapes and haunting vocals.

As far as my personal experience and opinions go, I have mixed feelings about this album. While there are certainly moments of greatness, there are also moments of mediocrity. Nevertheless, I commend Kannberg for his honesty and vulnerability throughout the album, and for exploring complex themes that are not often explored in the rock genre.

In conclusion, ‘The Real Feel’ by Spiral Stairs is a mixed bag that showcases the best and worst of the rock genre. While it does not reach the heights of some of Kannberg’s previous work, it is still capable of delivering some truly standout moments.","1.

Scott Walker,5 Easy Pieces,Rock,9.5,January 12 2004,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"Anthologizing Scott Walker's career is a daunting task. Along with Walker, perhaps only The Beatles, Roxy Music, John Cale and David Bowie have engulfed themselves in both art and pop and created such riches in each vein. Incredibly, Walker swung much further in each direction than any of those other artists, singing standards (and other housewives' choices) on a TV variety show, and creating famously impenetrable, esoteric work on his most recent (a loosely used term here, to be sure) solo albums. Therefore, the first challenge of any examination of his career demands rectifying the split between his more populist and cerebral impulses. Happily, the five-disc, 93-track 5 Easy Pieces rises to the challenge, capturing the on-the-surface duality between Walker's MOR song styling and his avant-garde leanings, as well as demonstrating the common ground shared by everything he did in between. Born Scott Engel in Ohio, Walker was one-third of The Walker Brothers, a group of ex-pats sold back to America as the crooner arm of the British Invasion, but it was in the UK that The Walker Brothers had the most success, enjoying a pair of #1 singles and rivaling The Beatles, Stones, and Monkees as the biggest-selling band of the mid-1960s. (Conversely, their U.S. run consisted of just two top 20 singles.) The group disbanded in 1967, and Walker released four solo albums over the next three years, laying his expressive and sometimes bombastic vocals over lush string and horn arrangements. More a Left Bank stylist than a Las Vegas one, Walker's earliest solo records are best characterized by bawdy, cabaret-esque Jacques Brel covers. Soon, however, Walker shifted from song interpretations to original compositions. These songs, colored by existentialist musings, overweight prostitutes, Josef Stalin, The Seventh Seal, and the Sisyphean struggles of vulnerable, damaged souls, didn't sit well with his established fanbase. The commercial failure of Walker's fourth (and best) solo album, Scott 4-- the first of his releases to feature only his own songwriting, and one criminally not represented on this box by either ""Duchess"" or ""Two Ragged Soldiers""-- dented his confidence. After 1970's 'Til the Band Comes In-- a quick follow-up split evenly between Walker originals and covers-- also tanked, Walker spent the rest of the first half of that decade returning to his balladeer roots. During this time, he hosted his own TV variety show and released five limp albums of standards, film themes, and country-tinged pop covers. When a couple of mid-70s albums by the reunited Walker Brothers did little to stir the commercial or critical pot, Walker's career seemed stranded. Yet, unexpectedly, on a third Walker Brothers comeback album, 1978's Nite Flights, Scott kicked off the second half of his career, offering four original tracks-- his first compositions in eight years. Angular pieces with opaque lyrics and elements of both Krautrock and Sheffield's burgeoning electronic scene, Walker's new work couldn't have been further from the Nashville-tinged dirges that the Brothers Mk. II had been recording. After that release, Walker drifted further into reclusion, releasing solo albums in 1984 (Climate of Hunter) and 1995 (Tilt), only recently re-surfacing to do soundtrack, songwriting, and production work for (or alongside) artists ranging from Pulp to Ute Lemper to Sonic Youth. Earlier attempts to compile Walker's career have focused either solely on The Walker Brothers or his initial solo output. Of the latter, Razor & Tie's It's Raining Today is far too Spartan and scattershot to be recommended. The UK releases were only a slightly better bet: Sings Jacques Brel and Boy Child-- which compiles the best of Walker's own writing from 1967-1970-- are merely adequate snapshots of one particular phase of Walker's career. A specialist approach was also attempted by the compilers of 5 Easy Pieces, in which each of the set's discs is arranged by theme, or ""ways into the heart of Scott Walker."" The In My Room disc collects kitchen-sink dramas and lonely howls at the moon. Where's the Girl? is subtitled Songs of Lady, Love and Loss, but as its proper title suggests, the emphasis is on ""loss."" The third disc, An American in Europe, divvies up his ruminations on his home and adopted home-- thankfully including only one of his country-rock songs. This Is How You Disappear-- despite borrowing its title from ""Patriot"", a track on CD3-- is an alternate ""greatest hits,"" focusing on Walker's later, more avant-garde releases. Finally, Scott on Screen collects his cinematic works, most notably a portion of the score he composed for Leos Carax's 1999 film Pola X. With a large number of rare and out-of-print tracks sitting alongside most of his best-known work, this is a rare collection that would appeal to both Walker devotees and novices. And with a few exceptions, each disc is arranged chronologically, demonstrating in some cases that Walker's unusual path didn't have as many sharp turns as most would think. In My Room and Where's the Girl? each feature a half-dozen of the more dark, brooding Walker Brothers tracks. It's just as well: The popular Walker Brothers songs are easily found on bargain comps, and none of them are predicative of Walker's solo career. So, for example, instead of a U.S. hit like ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)"", you get that record's stronger B-side, the Drifters-like ""After the Lights Go Out"". Each of these dozen tracks-- ranging from the full-throated Wall of Sound of ""Hurting Each Other"" (a song popularized by The Guess Who!) to the bedsit lament of ""In My Room""-- is a well-selected gem. The bulk of the first two discs, however, is made up of Walker's best-known solo songs: lush, emotionally engaging ballads such as ""It's Raining Today"", ""Montague Terrace (in Blue)"", and ""The Amorous Humphrey Plugg"". Among his rarer works here are the jazz-tinged ""Joe"" and ""Time Operator"", ""Someone Who Cared""-- the slow-burning highlight of Stretch-- and the largely forgettable Esther Ofarim-voiced ""Long About Now"" from Til' the Band Comes In. Where's the Girl? also includes a pair of dramatic, sprawling 11-minute epics written for German chanteuse Ute Lemper's 2000 album Punishing Kiss (which also features compositions from Nick Cave, Neil Hannon, and Elvis Costello), each of which is rich in both ambition and nuance. An American in Europe is the most accessible of the five discs. The first half (""Europe"") is highlighted by eight mostly buoyant, sexually charged and rousing Brel covers that no doubt caused more than a few blushes when they were first released. It also boasts Walker's excellent Brelian pastiche ""The Girls from the Streets"" and the Scott 3 highlight ""Copenhagen"". The ""America"" half kicks off with the militaristic march of ""We Came Through"", and includes the delicate twang of ""Rhymes of Goodbye"", B-side ""My Way Home"", and ""Cowbells Shakin'"", the title track to The Walker Brothers' Lines, and four of the more less-then-leftfield tracks from Climate of Hunter and 1995's notoriously difficult Tilt. Speaking of ""difficult"", the gloves are off on This Is How You Disappear, which for long-time fans is perhaps the most intriguing of the discs, as it tells a fairly linear alternate history of Walker's career. The disc has a mere three songs plucked from his late-60s period: much beloved B-side ""The Plague"", ""Plastic Palace People"", and ""Boy Child"". For the most part, though, it's dominated by the most crucial tracks from his post-1970 albums: four each from The Walker Brothers' 1978 comeback Nite Flights (the only ones on that album penned by Scott), Climate of Hunter, and Tilt. Walker's vaguely Frippian/Teutonic work for Nite Flights peaks with the underrated synth-pop of ""The Electrician"", a benchmark for the late-70s Berlin fashionistas and a template for the more uncompromising post-punk electronic artists such as Cabaret Voltaire and The Human League. The Climate of Hunter tracks are even more textural and abstract, and those from Tilt can be exercises in patience and endurance for some listeners. Scott on Screen is the set's least essential collection of music, but perversely, is the most valuable to the box, as it collects seven Pola X pieces, as well as works from nine additional sources (including, oddly, the recent James Bond film The World Is Not Enough). Cherry-picking a number of excellent curios from Walker's past (including a mere one cut from career low-light ""The Moviegoer"") and mixing them with his haunting orchestral work, Scott on Screen is the disc best approached as individual tracks. Of course, a document of Walker's film work was never going to be anything but slightly clumsy when presented on one disc, and it's a tiny quibble for rescuing a number of his lesser-known and difficult-to-find (even by file-sharing standards) works. An increasingly revered figure, Scott Walker is a singular craftsmen, one of rock's few individuals to demonstrate a willingness to both embrace elements of the unfashionable and ignore prevailing trends, yet also display an acute awareness of contemporary sounds. Forgoing many of the stylistic trappings of rock, Walker has explored a broad range of Western musical styles and displayed an intellectualism that is at times subversive, hilarious, cutting and poignant. It's a slight bit odd to attempt to delve into the heart and mind of one of pop's most anomalous and enigmatic figures by examining his work-- that's an approach more often reserved for long-departed painters, sculptors or writers who created in often self-conscious ""periods."" Therefore, as an exploration of an artist's psyche, 5 Easy Pieces is incomplete at best. More importantly, however, as an exploration of this artist's career, it's endlessly rewarding, almost wholly engrossing, and long overdue.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8763-5-easy-pieces/,Interscope,2003.0,"Scott Walker's 5 Easy Pieces is a masterpiece that fully and completely embodies the ethos of rock and roll.

I have been a fan of Scott Walker's for years, and this album remains one of my go-to listens when I need to get into the rock zone.

To truly appreciate 5 Easy Pieces, one must understand the history of the band and the story of how this album came to be. Scott Walker, a true icon of the rock genre, rose to fame in the 60s as a member of the Walker Brothers before moving on to a successful solo career. His unique voice and poetic lyrics set him apart from many of his contemporaries and helped him carve out a place in music history.

The story of 5 Easy Pieces begins with Walker's desire to simplify his sound and get back to the basics of rock and roll. After years of experimentation and pushing boundaries, he wanted to create an album that captured the raw energy and spirit of the genre. And boy, did he succeed.

The album starts with the powerful ""Mathilde"", a track that sets the tone for what is to come. It's a gritty, energetic song that captures the essence of rock and roll. From there, the album takes listeners on a journey through a range of emotions, from the introspective ""Montague Terrace (In Blue)"" to the upbeat ""The Girls from the Streets"", all the while maintaining a consistent sound that is both raw and refined.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Big Louise"", a haunting and melancholic song that showcases Walker's unparalleled talent for storytelling. His lyrics are poetic and emotive, painting a vivid picture of a lonely, troubled woman. The song is beautifully arranged and perfectly captures the mood of the lyrics.

Another personal favorite of mine is ""Jackie"", a song that is both catchy and dark. The instrumentation is simple yet effective, and Walker's vocals are at their best here. The chorus is infectious and sticks with you long after the song is over.

Overall, Scott Walker's 5 Easy Pieces is a must-listen for any rock music aficionado. It's an album that encapsulates everything that makes rock and roll great: energy, emotion, and raw talent. It's an album that I listen to on repeat and never tire of.

Graveyard,Innocence & Decadence,Rock,7.4,September 30 2015,J. Edward Keyes,Contributor,"Though they’ve netted comparisons to everyone from Black Sabbath to Thin Lizzy, if there is an analog in the history of hard rock to the Swedish group Graveyard, it is probably Judas Priest. Both bands have roots in blues, both have a fondness for topping caramel-sweet melodies with gravel and tacks, and both know precisely how to ride the edge of bombast and camp without ever becoming the Darkness. On their fourth album, Graveyard root around even deeper in their record collections. In the kind of quote that becomes instantly regrettable, frontman Joakim Nilsson once said that he wanted the band to be a mix of Slayer and Howlin’ Wolf, but on Innocence & Decadence, they also find room for Motown, Dylan, and Queen. What makes the record work is the way they synthesize all of this into something that is swell-chested, triumphant, and surprisingly human, dosing each song with equal amounts of swagger and charm. In a genre that often prides itself on being forbidding, Innocence is a proudly welcoming metal record, throwing open its tattooed arms and carrying off even the darker material with a wink and a smile. That all-in m.o. is evident from the outset. Opener ""Magnetic Shunk"" rides in on a deep-set, galloping blues groove, Nilsson’s eye on a woman at the far end of the bar. Instead of shaming or objectifying her for her sexual experience, Nilsson celebrates it—""It’s nobody’s business who you give your kiss""—before devising an almost comically ridiculous come-on: ""No need to be gentle, baby, I like it raw/ Treat me like I was crime and you are the law."" That kind of loopy wordplay turns up throughout Innocence; on ""The Apple & the Tree"", whose wandering guitar lead sounds like a distant cousin to ""All Along the Watchtower"", Nilsson opens singing, ""I remember the days I don’t recall."" Before the absurdity of the line can be fully absorbed, he’s skated clean into the song’s slow-winding chorus (the lyrics of which suggest the title’s apple might be the same one that turned up in Genesis Chapter 2). The hard-charging ""Never Theirs to Sell"" is a lean, mean-eyed, fist-pumping anthem of defiance, opening into a double-time, soul-clap break about halfway through that imagines Angus Young sitting in with the MGs. Though the twin themes in the album’s title turn up in most of its songs, it’s the former that gets the most airtime. On the breathless, roller-coastering ""From a Hole in the Wall"", while low-end guitars pummel like rubber bullets, bassist Truls Morck sings, ""Can you hear a big bird singing somewhere in the back of your mind?/ It’s loud enough to make you wonder/ ‘Can I please hear it one more time?’"" Lines like this contribute to the album’s odd sense of sweetness—youth isn’t fetishized as a period of penalty-free rule-breaking, but considered wistfully, as a time of almost ceramic cleanness, before things like pain and disappointment became everyday occurrences. That same sentiment is given flesh, blood, and a broken heart in the straight-up soul ballad ""Too Much Is Not Enough"", which wouldn’t sound entirely out of place on an Amy Winehouse B-sides comp. Over a wood-fired blues lick, Nilsson mournfully watches a longtime lover walk out the door, before concluding, ""I know you tried to keep us together/ But in the end, there was nothing left to keep."" The gospel trio that parenthesize his verses provides the necessary dramatic flourish. Innocence was recorded at Atlantis Grammofon Studios in Stockholm, which is the same place ABBA recorded their earliest material. While it’s not quite the same deep-dive into confectionary pop, Innocence shares both that group’s fondness for immediate melodies and their egalitarian spirit. Theirs is a club where you might get lucky, you might burn the night philosophizing, or you might reconnect with old friends. Best of all, it has a decidedly low barrier of entry: If you’ve ever nursed a drink while thinking misty-eyed about the good old days, you’re in.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20914-innocence-decadence/,Nuclear Blast,2015.0,"Let me tell you about the experience of listening to Graveyard's 'Innocence & Decadence.' From start to finish, the album is a thrill ride through the world of rock music. The band, known for their powerful sound and dynamic live shows, has really outdone themselves with this release. 

Before even listening to the album, it's important to understand the band's history. Formed in 2006 in Gothenburg, Sweden, they burst onto the scene with their debut album, 'Graveyard.' From there, they continued to release albums that adopted a 70s rock sound, paying homage to the likes of Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer. However, with 'Innocence & Decadence,' Graveyard has stepped away from the bluesy riffs and psychedelic undertones that have defined their earlier work, and instead embraced a more modern sound.

The creation story of this album is truly fascinating. While in the midst of a European tour, the band found out that drummer Axel Sjöberg was leaving the band. This news was a shock to everyone, including the band members themselves. Even with the looming uncertainty of the band's future, they decided to finish the tour - and it was during a soundcheck in Paris where they started to come up with some of the tracks on 'Innocence & Decadence.' 

Now, onto the music itself. From the opening track, ""Magnetic Shunk,"" Graveyard immediately sets the tone for this album - it's a more mature sound, one that is confident in its power and energy. Vocalist Joakim Nilsson's delivery is raw and soulful, and the instrumentation is tight and polished. Tracks like ""The Apple and the Tree"" and ""Too Much is Not Enough"" showcase the band's ability to write catchy, sing-along choruses without sacrificing their rock sensibilities. 

One of the standout moments on the album is ""Exit 97,"" a slower, bluesy track that serves as a beautiful interlude before the explosive ""Never Theirs to Sell."" The latter is a thunderous track that features some of the band's heaviest riffs to date. 

As someone who has been a fan of Graveyard for a while, I was initially hesitant to embrace this new sound - after all, I loved their previous albums for a reason. However, after a few listens of 'Innocence & Decadence,' I found myself completely won over by its energy and sophistication. 

Overall, I would give this album a solid 8 out of 10. It's not quite the same Graveyard that fans have come to know and love, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Graveyard has shown with this album that they are willing to take risks and try something different - and the result is a powerful, dynamic album that stands out as one of the best rock releases of the year.","1.

Damon Albarn,Dr Dee,Rock,6.7,May 7 2012,Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,"There was a very specific moment in Damon Albarn's career when he decided to think of England for a living. The year was 1992, and Blur were touring the U.S. in support of their underperforming debut, Leisure, a relatively tepid guitar-pop record of vague lyrics and the occasional explosive hook. Missing his homeland and repulsed by the self-serious, omnipresent grunge sound, he returned to England two months later with the intention of making music that was proudly, flagrantly British. It proved to be a good look for the band: with the release of their next two albums, the solid Modern Life is Rubbish in 1993 and the sparkling Parklife in 1994, Blur transformed their image from late-era Madchester tag-alongs to pop's most incisive inquisitors of the British way of life. This was in great part thanks to Albarn's character-driven lyrics: Rubbish's no-name 20th-Century Boy and 20th-Century Girl and Parklife's Tracy Jacks (a sad sack civil servant who cracks one Tuesday morning and bulldozes his own house) warned of what could happen without the promise of tomorrows, the thrill of spontaneity, and a belief in a rather optimistic strain of anarchy it was not off base to call magic. Two decades later, Albarn is exploring the idea of Britshness through a character and a form that's decidedly less modern. A departure from his most recent work with Gorillaz and the afro-inspired Rocket Juice & the Moon, Dr Dee is the stately, melancholy soundtrack to the opera Albarn wrote for theater director Rufus Norris. Dr Dee had a brief preliminary run in Manchester last year and will run again during the Cultural Olympiad this summer, but in the meantime Albarn-- never one for a second of downtime-- holed up with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded the tracks for what's being nominally presented as a solo album. As far as British anti-heroes go, John Dee is a good deal more spectacular and complex than, say, Tracy Jacks. Dee was a brilliant, controversial visionary of the Elizabethan era, a gifted mathematician with an unerring belief in magic. Throughout his long life he fell in and out of favor with the court; at one point during Mary's reign he was arrested for charting the queen's horoscopes, while three years later Queen Elizabeth appointed him her scientific advisor and asked him to choose her coronation date based on her star chart. A firm believer in the occult who late in his life made attempts to communicate with angels, Dee's life was a combination of prestige, failure, and misunderstandings, and the tone of Dr Dee makes it clear that Albarn finds luxuriant depths of melancholy in his character. On the lush, downcast ""The Moon Exalted"", he is accompanied by the porcupine-bristle of a harpsicord as he sings, ""It's a powerful thing/ The morning I awoke to find you'd gone/ The moon was rising higher than the sun."" In recent years, Albarn's retired the bratty stacatto that characterized his Britpop hits, and his voice has taken on this wonderfully droopy, lead-balloon quality. With nary an upbeat moment over the soundtrack's 50-minute run, Dr Dee makes use of this stylistic evolution; it's without a doubt the biggest bummer of a record he's made since 13. Like the large majority of Dr Dee listeners, I have not seen the opera. It garnered pretty good reviews over its first run, but the most common criticism seemed to be that it was a tad impenetrable; viewers who went expecting a clear, linear narrative found Albarn's collection of impressionistic tableaus hard to follow. And if those were the complaints of people who actually had a visual element to guide them, you can imagine that listening blindly to the soundtrack is not exactly a cake walk, comprehension-wise. Still, there's some enjoyment in getting lost in Albarn's gloomy melodies and the occasional immersive scene (the fluttering voices of ""Coronation"" in particular), if you are content to let go your hopes of any kind of narrative mastery. To me, oddly enough, the closest pop analog to Dr Dee is a (much more sedate) Frog Eyes record-- the frenzied, King Lear-inspired pantomime Paul's Tomb: A Triumph is never entirely subsumed by the fact that I have no idea what the hell is going on. I could say the same for most of Dr Dee. But therein lies the problem: Presented apart from its visual component, what is the Dr Dee soundtrack, exactly? There are pop elements to Albarn's compositions here, but they won't be quite enough to hold the attention spans of his less patient fans. And on the other side of the coin, Albarn's pop-star background keeps Dr Dee from scaling more operatic heights. In the end, the Dr Dee soundtrack is a deeply felt but difficult to love entry into Albarn's entirely singular discography. A Renaissance man to a point that occasionally confounds his less adventurous listeners, it should be no great mystery why Albarn finds Dee-- who was, after all, the man who coined the term ""Britannia"" in the first place-- a worthy subject.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16585-damon-albarn-dr-dee/,Parlophone,2012.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Damon Albarn's latest album, ""Dr Dee"". Known for his contributions in Blur and Gorillaz, Albarn has once again indulged his creative juices, this time for a solo project that depicts the life story of Elizabethan scientist and philosopher John Dee.

Coming from someone who has enjoyed Albarn's past work, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this album. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it's undeniable that Albarn has successfully created an atmospheric and immersive experience that transports listeners to a different time and place.

The album's creation story is as fascinating as its content. Albarn was inspired to create this album after being commissioned to write an opera about John Dee. However, he found the story too large for one production and so decided to delve deeper into it for a solo album. The result is a unique blend of rock and opera, with elements of folk and classical music to emphasize the story's historical setting.

On a personal level, the album's haunting opening track ""The Golden Dawn"" immediately captured my attention. Albarn's vocals, along with the use of harpsichord and strings, set the tone for what was to come. The instrumental track ""Apple Carts"" is also a standout, with its minimalist and melancholic melody that is enough to make anyone feel introspective.

However, not all tracks on the album hit the mark for me. ""The Marvelous Dream"" felt slightly out of place with its upbeat instruments and pop-like rhythm, and I found the lyrics to be a bit generic. While ""Cathedrals"" has beautiful harmonies and melody, the subject matter feels repetitive within the context of the album.

As a whole, I would give ""Dr Dee"" a rating of 6.7 out of 10, as it's not an album that I would listen to on a regular basis. However, I do believe that it's an album that deserves recognition for its ambition and unique sound. If you're a fan of Albarn's past work, or if you're simply looking for something a little different, then I recommend giving ""Dr Dee"" a listen. Who knows, it might just surprise you with its brilliance.","1. Review A is much longer than Review B, indicating more detail and depth, which is typical of a human-written review.

Popol Vuh,Revisited & Remixed (1970-1999),Electronic,7.8,August 22 2011,Nick Neyland,Contributor,"Boiling down the work of any group that spanned three decades is never going to be easy. For German avant gardists Popol Vuh, it's practically impossible. The band was founded by Florian Fricke in 1969 and largely remained his vision throughout, albeit with useful accomplices picked up along the way. Popol Vuh are often slotted into krautrock/kosmische musik categories, but their work also variously edged close to prog, new age, and ambient. They are perhaps best known for providing the soundtracks to many of Werner Herzog's feature films, and this year the SPV label put out a box set gathering some of those. ""Florian was always able to create music I feel helps audiences visualize something hidden in the images onscreen, and in our own souls too,"" said the director in Herzog on Herzog. Here, SPV again pays tribute to Fricke on the 10th anniversary of his death, gathering strains of the band's original recordings and completing the package with a disc of remixes. This is the kind of release that will have longstanding Popol Vuh followers raising an eyebrow at what's not included-- the monolithic drone piece ""Vuh"" from In den Gärten Pharaos is missing, and there's nothing from the classic 1972 release Hosianna Mantra. It's heavy on the soundtrack work and sequenced in non-chronological order, beginning with the stirring ""Aguirre I - Lacrima Di Rei"" from Herzog's 1972 feature Aguirre, the Wrath of God. The synergy between Herzog and Fricke comes from a place where malevolence, beauty, and eminence are vying for equal space. ""Aguirre I"" features peals of artificial choir sound, played by Fricke on a mellotron-like device called a ""choir organ"" that triggered tiny loops of field recordings. It's a colossal sound that feels both daunting and alluring, something to fear and rejoice in at the same time, where the real and the unreal seem to seep into one another. Fricke's Aguirre soundtrack is among the best work he produced in his career, but there's such scope to the Popol Vuh sound that it scarcely matters that the bar is raised so high so early. The lengthy title track from the band's debut record Affenstunde (1970) documents Fricke's fascination with folksy percussion and the mantra-like possibilities that emerged from sustaining single notes on a Moog. That space between artifice and actuality is where Popol Vuh's music finds its muscle, adding to the feeling of something arching across ancient and contemporary worlds, with Fricke jostling between earthy textures and the inter-planetary visions of his krautrock contemporaries. ""Affenstunde"" is paired with the similarly epic ""In den Gärten Pharaos"" on Revisited & Remixed, which forms another placid divide between pulsing synth noise, primitive hand percussion, balmy Rhodes-like plinking, and sounds extracted from the natural world. It might have been better to follow ""Affenstunde"" with the much darker ""Vuh"" instead of ""In den Gärten Pharaos"", just to show off the great surge of energy they were capable of summoning. But there are so many sides to Popol Vuh that it's no surprise some are missing on this release. Instead, a couple of superior cuts from the soundtrack to Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre are among the highlights. Here Fricke again explores the dichotomy between the real and the unreal and the primitive and the present, through throaty voice manipulations, contemplative acoustic plucking, raga-like drones, and playful baroque arrangements. It's difficult to listen to Popol Vuh's career broken down in this way, dislocated from the strange trajectory they followed. Lurching from the ambient precursor ""Ich Mache Einen Spiegel"" to the sweeping drift of the Cobra Verde soundtrack feels messy and unfocused. Instead, this record is best seen as a jumping off point for the uninitiated, a way to point travelers in the right direction instead of a singular piece in its own right. The second disc is an uneven selection of prosaic remixes, with few highlights. Haswell & Hecker's reworking of ""Aguirre I/II"" taps into that extraordinary otherworldly quality of the original piece, building it into a towering wall of shifting noise then shattering it apart as though they've taken a hammer to glass. Elsewhere, too many of the artists sound like they're attempting to assimilate sounds into their own catalogs: Mouse on Mars' version of ""Through Pain to Heaven"" is an incongruously heavy handed club jam, while Stereolab's take on ""Hosianna Mantra"" papers over all the peculiar elements that make Popol Vuh such an alluring listen. Thomas Fehlmann's version of ""Schnee"" works better, with its piston-like rhythm veering closer to Fricke's world. Perversely, what the remixes lack-- risk, pomposity, refinement, transformative power-- is everything Popol Vuh's original recordings feed off to find their mettle.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15732-revisited-remixed-1970-1999/,SPV,2011.0,"Popol Vuh's 'Revisited & Remixed (1970-1999)' is a breathtaking collection that is truly a testament to the power of electronic music. As someone who is passionate about this genre, I was delighted to have stumbled across this album that not only showcases the band's work but also provides a unique perspective on their creative journey.

Popol Vuh is a German band that was formed in the early 1970s. Their music was initially inspired by the experimentalism of Krautrock, but they later evolved their sound to incorporate elements of ambient, electronic, and even traditional folk music. This evolution is evident in their 'Revisited & Remixed (1970-1999)' album as it contains tracks spanning three decades of their creative output.

The album features a remarkable mix of tracks that are notable for their use of electronic instrumentation and soundscapes. From the memorable opening track, ""Aguirre I"" to the haunting ""In Your Eyes,"" each song on this album showcases Popol Vuh's mastery of this genre. The remixes also add a fresh perspective to their work and make it exciting to revisit some of their classic tracks.

As someone who is new to Popol Vuh's music, I was struck by their gift for creating music that is both stimulating and introspective. The electronic soundscapes and the deep basslines create a hypnotic atmosphere that makes this album ideal for contemplative listening. At the same time, the complexity of the instrumentation and the intricate layering of sounds keep the listener engaged.

The album's highlights for me were undoubtedly the tracks ""Hüter der Schwelle"" and ""Why Do I Still Sleep."" The former has an almost mystical quality to it, with the use of traditional instrumentation like the flute and the tabla adding an otherworldly touch to the already ethereal soundscapes. The latter track, on the other hand, is a departure from the rest of the album and is more reminiscent of Popol Vuh's earlier work. The instrumentation is stripped down, and the vocals are haunting, leaving an indelible impression on the listener.

Overall, I would rate 'Revisited & Remixed (1970-1999)' by Popol Vuh a 7.8 out of 10. While every track on the album isn't a masterpiece, it certainly has its moments of brilliance. The album showcases the band's devotional attachment to electronic music and their willingness to experiment and evolve. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who is passionate about the genre or is looking to explore the vast world of electronic music.","1.

Cerberus Shoal,The Land We All Believe In,Rock,7.3,October 12 2005,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"These are fertile times for political absurdists, a fact that's clearly not been lost on the wayfarers of Cerberus Shoal. Without much fanfare, the Portland, Maine-based group has constructed a broad and unwieldy discography that is resistant to blanket judgements. But for their 11th release, the avant-garde troupe have issued what is surely their most topical, lyrically-focused collection, and the The Land We All Believe In emerges as a magnanimous, comic investigation into realities both political and otherwise. Along the route Cerberus Shoal maintain their catholic approach to instrumentation and deformed pop structures, resulting in their loopiest piece of sonic theater to date. Over the course of their now decade-plus career, Cerberus Shoal's sound has undergone a higher-than-average number of directional shifts, due primarily to their ever-revolving membership. Since 2003's Chaiming the Knoblessone, however, the roster has relatively stabilized into a regular septet that now also includes percussionist Tim Morin. Produced by Scott Colburn, longtime cohort of the Sun City Girls and John Fahey's Revenent label, the music on The Land We All Believe In continues to function without an absolute center. In true ensemble form everyone takes turns sharing vocal duties and assuming the spotlight, and never before has the group sounded further afield from their indie-punk origins. Here in fact there are long stretches where they instead explore various pre-rock forms, roaming freely through gnarled ethnic folk, woozy sea chanteys, and trilling showtunes in a manner reminiscent of a looser, more rustic Thinking Fellers Union Local #282. ""Reality, you are not quite what you used to be,"" sing Colleen Kinsella and Erin Davidson over banjo and clattering percussion on the elegiac opening title track, a sentiment that the group then proceed to repeatedly confirm over the course of the next hour. Founding member Chriss Sutherland pilots the manic ""Wyrm"" over choppy waters, vocalizing in his own distinct, impenetrable dialect; while ""Pie for the President"" prescribes a unique form of activism (""Bring a pie to ze president/ I want to feed him big sausages"") and ""Junior"" perhaps takes further oblique swipes at our Commander in Chief, ""Junior, I've got something to tell you/ All that you fear is shit."" Things come increasingly unhinged on the epic-length ""The Ghosts Are Greedy"", which contains an extended mid-song spoken word segment railing against the government, media coverage, and the mysterious ""Dr. Draino"". Eventually this track opens into a reassuring coda that optimistically proclaims, ""There is no conflict...We belong united,"" noble sentiments that would likely be more persuasive were the group's vocals not so progressively melodramatic and Muppet-like. And as the album closes with the jazzily skewed ""Taking Out the Enemy"", one is left with the impression that perhaps Cerberus Shoal make their best arguments in favor of a tolerant, egoless unity at those times when they all keep their mouths shut and let their playfully audacious music do their talking.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1387-the-land-we-all-believe-in/,North East Indie,2005.0,"""The Land We All Believe In"" by Cerberus Shoal is a unique gem in the rock music genre. With a 7.3 rating out of 10, it is no surprise that this album boasts of intricate compositions, intense musicianship and a stimulating blend of rock genres. This album is perfect for lovers of experimental rock who are not afraid to explore new sounds.

Cerberus Shoal is a rock band that hails from Maine, USA. It was formed in 1994 by members of two other bands, The Break and Cerberus Shoal. The band's early music was heavily influenced by hardcore punk, metal, and free jazz. Over the years, the band's lineup and sound evolved, incorporating elements of Americana, folk and post-rock.

Their album, ""The Land We All Believe In,"" is no exception. It is clear that the band pushed themselves to create something special. The music has a raw, powerful energy that reflects the band's beliefs and experiences. The lyrics are thought-provoking, the rhythms are complex and the sound is rich and layered.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Life is No Way to Treat an Animal."" It's a hauntingly honest look at our society and how we treat animals. The music's gentle yet powerful progression is just as moving as the lyrics. There's something intensely captivating about the song that leaves a lasting impression. It's just one example of how Cerberus Shoal manages to take the familiar and make it something entirely new.

Expanding on that, ""Crash"" is another great track that exemplifies the band's creativity. The song starts with a soulful blast of horns and builds to a crescendo of layered vocals, percussion and guitar. The track's melody is a rollercoaster of emotions and sounds, with the hooks standing out on each turn. It's definitely a song that will get stuck in your head for days.

While listening to this album, I was struck by how dynamic their sound is. They effortlessly blend together traditional rock instruments with orchestral arrangements and experimental sounds, demonstrating their versatility as artists. It's easy to see why Cerberus Shoal has such a dedicated following.

In conclusion, ""The Land We All Believe In"" is an album for anyone who loves rock music that pushes the boundaries. The band's history and creative vision are evident in every song. Though it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate complex and adventurous music will definitely find something to love here. All in all, a great album that deserves to be heard by anyone interested in experiencing something completely different.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed.

Mike WiLL Made-It,Ransom 2,Rap,6.9,March 31 2017,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"As Metro Boomin became trap’s workhorse, Mike WiLL Made-It, so named by Gucci Mane in the thick of his prolific mixtape run, has expanded his repertoire with radical pivots—zany psychedelic trips and chic pop promenades. Since announcing himself on Meek Mill’s chest-beating fame-measurer “Tupac Back,” he has produced everything from spacey trap ballads (Future’s “Turn On the Lights”), to strip club anthems (“Bandz a Make Her Dance”), sensual R&B massagers (Ciara’s “Body Party”), pop bangers (Miley Cyrus’ “We Can’t Stop”), diva tributes (Beyoncé’s “Formation”), and even ad fodder, on his way to becoming one of rap’s most versatile soundmen. When WiLL shared instrumentals from his 2016 discography, it was a dizzying flex, a colorful mosaic of pop-trap stems that omitted key moments by mistake. There are so many jams he forgets some. In the middle, he scored his first-ever Hot 100 chart-topper by producing the viral sensation “Black Beatles” for Rae Sremmurd, the flagship act of his EarDrummers imprint. The victory seemed to affirm his vision: not only had thinking outside the rap box paid big dividends, it’d done so for artists he’d nurtured, who’d been all but denounced by old-fangled rap gatekeepers. The next logical step is a compilation projecting these accumulated successes. Ransom 2, WiLL’s debut album and sequel to a 2014 mixtape, is equal parts cash grab, roster exhibition, and résumé bulletin. But because it’s a Mike WiLL creation, it can’t help but thrill. Ransom 2 isn’t remarkably different than its predecessor; in fact, 13 guests return from the first outing. The bigger names showcase a quick flip through Mike WiLL’s contact list: Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, Future, Pharrell, Lil Wayne, Big Sean, Migos, YG, and more. The other faces are part of an EarDrummers promotion: Rae Sremmurd, Eearz, Andrea, Fortune and producers Pluss, Resource, and Marz. Though many are repeat visitors, the album narrowly dodges feeling like a remake and there aren’t any obvious fluctuations in quality. It’s marked by plenty of Mike WiLL’s signature boggy drums, which hit with a slosh as opposed to a thud. Atop a choice range of his finest productions, the hitmakers of today and tomorrow collide. Over time, producers as accomplished as Mike WiLL acquire enough clout to cash-in the favors necessary to collect the one-offs and session extras that make up albums like these. They feel like rejects saved from the discard piles of more prominent releases. But many of the performances on Ransom 2 are so dynamic that songs don’t even feel like blips in the massive catalogs of constantly-active MCs like Future, Gucci Mane, and Young Thug. On “Perfect Pint,” the SremmLife duo trade raps with unlikely bunkmates Gucci and Kendrick Lamar, and the chemistry is a pleasant surprise. Future continues his recent form on the boomer “Razzle Dazzle.” Every good new Wayne verse feels like an affront to Birdman and “Faith” is no different, especially considering Young Money signee HoodyBaby tags along. With “W Y O (What You On),” Young Thug continues his trial runs with new flows, chattering through the first verse before ripping through the second in bursts. If anything, these tracks just feel like recaps for recent breakouts. As artists at the peak of their powers show glimpses of what makes them special, the crop of MCs hand selected by Mike WiLL for his crew earn their signings. Sremmurd’s Swae Lee, clearly the greatest asset on Mike WiLL’s team, gives a taste of the solo album he’s been teasing on “Bars of Soap,” a punchy departure from his usual animated fare. Andrea follows suit on “Burnin” with more bruising bars and a slashing flow. As a team, Lee and Slim Jxmmi make the most of a reunion with Chief Keef, each a unique but complementary variant of rap’s Auto-Tune wave. But it’s Eearz who makes the greatest impression with “Emotions Unlocked,” cutting through waves of distorted bass by pairing a sonorous delivery with nonstop pacing. Despite a slew of standouts, Ransom 2 doesn’t always get the most out of its guests. Lil Yachty’s ode to a Baywatcher, “Hasselhoff,” strays from the confectionary delights that made him so popular (and play to his strengths), opting instead for a straight-faced bar fest. Trouble and Problem’s tag-team effort, “Big God,” gets lost in the shuffle—neither big nor godly. And Fortune doesn’t show the same promise as his other EarDrummer colleagues on “Oh Hi Hater (Hiatus).” His mushy cadences get swallowed up by WiLL’s slimy synth gelatin. These minor misfires and a few forgettable verses aside, Mike WiLL Made-It’s Ransom 2 is an anthology that does exactly what it set out to do: fill his mantle with the shiny trophies of recent wins while making space for new ones.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23087-ransom-2/,"Interscope,Ear Drummer",2017.0,"Upon its release in 2017, ""Ransom 2,"" the second studio album by American record producer Mike WiLL Made-It, received mixed reviews from critics and fans alike. As a self-proclaimed rap enthusiast, I decided to give the album a spin and see for myself what all the fuss was about.

First of all, let's talk about Mike WiLL Made-It. The guy is a heavyweight in the hip-hop industry, having produced hits for some of the biggest names in rap, including Kendrick Lamar, Beyoncé, and Rae Sremmurd, just to name a few. He's known for his trap production style that features heavy bass and catchy hooks, and ""Ransom 2"" is no exception.

The album features an impressive lineup of collaborators, with big names such as Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, and Future making appearances on various tracks. But despite the star power, the album falls a little short in some areas.

As I listened to the album, I couldn't help but feel like there was something missing. Despite the impressive lineup of contributors, many of the tracks lacked the creativity and innovation that one might expect from such a talented group of artists. Sure, there were some bangers on the album, but overall it felt like a bit of a letdown.

Despite its flaws, ""Ransom 2"" is a solid addition to Mike WiLL Made-It's discography, and I'd recommend it to any fans of trap or hip-hop. But if you're expecting something groundbreaking or revolutionary, you might want to look elsewhere. The album is a solid, if unspectacular, effort from one of the most talented producers in the game.

In terms of production, ""Ransom 2"" is a masterclass in trap beats. The bass hits hard, the hi-hats sound crisp, and the overall mix is clean and well-balanced. Mike WiLL Made-It's signature style is on full display here, and there's no denying that the beats on this album slap.

But where the album falls short, in my opinion, is in its lack of lyrical depth. Many of the tracks feel like they're just going through the motions, with predictable flows and uninspired lyrics. This isn't to say that there aren't exceptions - tracks like ""Gucci On My"" and ""On The Come Up"" feature some solid verses - but overall the album doesn't push any boundaries in terms of lyrical creativity.

All in all, ""Ransom 2"" is a solid album that will satisfy fans of trap and hip-hop. It's not perfect, and there are certainly areas where it could have been stronger, but it's a worthwhile addition to any rap fan's collection. Would I give it a 6.9 out of 10? Yeah, I think that's about right.","1. Both reviews discuss the album ""Ransom 2"" by Mike WiLL Made-It.

Broken Social Scene,You Forgot It in People,Rock,9.2,February 2 2003,Ryan Schreiber,Founder,"It's a bit late to be talking about New Year's Resolutions, but mine was to dig through the boxes upon boxes of promos that arrive at the Pitchfork mailbox each month, and listen intently to hundreds of them in one sitting, in an attempt to discover those rare, impossibly great bands that would otherwise slip through the cracks. It's been an absolute bitch so far, and awfully disheartening, but I've hit paydirt a couple of times, and in those moments of glory, it's been worth wading through every cut-up Cuban big beat record, every generic Midwestern rock record, every bar band, every swing band. See, the problem is, it's impossible to know what's what; you have to just dive in and hope for the best, because sometimes the bands with the worst names and most hideous packaging are just great musicians who would make terrible image consultants. Case in point: Broken Social Scene. No one wants to admit that they like a band that goes around calling themselves this-- a band who, judging from their artwork, stands around all day looking pensive, crouching, and feeling the music in dramatic grayscale, a band that finds its home on Arts & Crafts/Paper Bag Records, who puts the message ""break all codes"" above their own barcode, and who dedicates their album to their ""families, friends and loves."" I already had them pegged! How could they not be the most unimaginative, bleak, whiny emo bastards in the whole pile? I don't know. But this disc is nothing like you'd imagine. Not even almost. I've been over it again and again looking for some cause, some reason, anything, that would compel a band with this much unfiltered creativity and kinetic energy-- a band without even the slightest suggestion of tear-stained poetry or bedroom catharsis-- to fall victim to the worst possible Vagrant Records clichés. I can't find it. All I know is that when I press play, and this disc whirrs to life, it inexplicably sheds its crybaby façade and becomes... sort of infinite. I've been listening to this disc for months on repeat-- sometimes just this disc for days-- but it wasn't until I began doing research for this review that it began to make sense how a band like this could materialize from out of nowhere with such a powerful and affecting album. I knew from the liners that the group has ten members (fifteen if you include guests); what I didn't know was that all of them have been wandering from band to band within the wildly experimental Toronto music scene for years, or that they all came together from groups like Stars, Do Make Say Think, Treble Charger, A Silver Mt. Zion, and Mascott with the unified goal of making, of all things, pop music. One of its members told a Toronto weekly that ""we'd already made our art-house albums... the whole ideology of trying to write an actual four-minute pop song was completely new to so many of us."" Who could have imagined it would come so easily? You Forgot It in People explodes with song after song of endlessly replayable, perfect pop. For proof, pick virtually any track: the sound barrier-bursting anthem ""Almost Crimes"", the subdued, gossamer ""Looks Just like the Sun"", the Dinosaur Jr.-tinted ""Cause = Time"", or the shimmering, Jeff Buckley-esque ""Lover's Spit"". And there's plenty more where that came from. How about the chugging guitar-pop of ""Stars and Sons"", which spins a distant, churning keyboard drone beneath the best moments of Spoon's Girls Can Tell and punctuates it with a barrage of percussive handclaps. Or ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl"" which showcases Emily Haines' melting alto caught in a beautiful, cyclical refrain and intensely modified by vocal effects while violins float atop subtle banjo plucking and cascading toms. Or ""KC Accidental"", which blasts searing, super-melodic guitar, a drumkit alternately galloping and relentlessly beaten, and an impenetrable wall of accelerating orchestration, before crash-landing into a deliquescent pop lullaby. The band's aforementioned art-house pedigree goes a long way toward making You Forgot It In People more than just another fantastic pop record: One of its foremost traits is its airy spaciousness. On many of its tracks, the sounds seem to resonate indefinitely, as if played at top volume on a Greenland hillside and recorded miles away. Simultaneously, the album is dense with the baroque instrumentation of all fifteen players, each part beautifully arranged, and all of them bleeding together in perfect harmonic unison. Chalk one up for heretofore unknown producer David Newfeld, who isolates the song's key instruments upfront in the mix, and captures all others as delicate nuances-- an expansive, pillowy bed of ethereal violins, muted trumpets and flutes to softly support the traditional guitars, bass and drums. Rock critic Michael Goldberg recently speculated that what makes music fanatics thirst for the obscure is the desire to discover music that is ""uncontaminated by the commerce machine."" This, he says, is the reason we cling to the abstract and unmarketable, the outlandish and abrasive. And yet, this is also the guy whose favorite album of last year was the painfully vacuous adult-contempo masterflop by Beth Gibbons & Rustin Man. Granted, not all of us share Goldberg's taste for sub-folk cheddar, but there's something like that record in each of our collections. So, how can there be room for both challenging, forward-thinking music and straight-up accessibility? Well, we're not total fucking assholes, right? We can kick back with Ekkehard Ehlers or Electric Light Orchestra-- there's inherent greatness in both. But the holy grail for people like us is the record that combines outright experimentation and strong hooks, something that engages us mentally while appealing to the instincts that draw us toward pop immediacy. Some of the best records ever have been ones that put these two seemingly disparate elements together-- and you can go as recent as The Notwist's Neon Golden or as far back as Sgt. Pepper's (and probably farther, if you want). This kind of music shouldn't be hard to come by; it's just that not many artists are able to perfect that balance. Broken Social Scene have, and even made it seem effortless. I wish I could convey to you just how perfectly this record pulls off that balancing act, how incredibly catchy and hummable these songs are, despite their refusal to resort to pandering or oversimplicity. I wish I could convey how they've made just exactly the kind of pop record that stands the test of time, and how its ill-advised packaging and shudder-inducing bandname seem so infinitesimal after immersing yourself in the music. And I hate to end this saying, ""You just have to hear it for yourself."" But oh my god, you do. You just really, really do.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/952-you-forgot-it-in-people/,"Arts & Crafts,Paper Bag",2002.0,"If you're one to geek out over making playlists, you owe it to yourself to put on ""You Forgot It in People"" by Broken Social Scene. This rock music gem is revered among fans and critics alike, and it's easy to see why.

Broken Social Scene is a Canadian indie rock collective that has been active since 1999. It's not your typical band, as its lineup can fluctuate from show to show, but the founding members Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning have remained constants throughout its existence. The band has had some commercial success, but that's not what makes them special. Rather, it's their ability to bring together different talents and perspectives into one cohesive sound that sets them apart.

""You Forgot It in People"" was released in 2002 and has since gained a strong cult following. The album was created during a pivotal time for the band. Following the success of their debut album, the band had to deal with the departure of several members. This could have spelled doom for the band, but instead, they channeled their hardship into creating something truly special.

From the first track ""Capture the Flag,"" it's clear that this is a band that knows how to make a statement. The guitar riffs, the funky bassline, and the horns come together to create a sound that is both chaotic and beautifully intricate. In fact, the album's strength lies in its ability to blend so many different sounds and moods. ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl"" is dreamy and ethereal, while ""Almost Crimes"" is a frenzied dance party waiting to happen.

It's hard for me to pick a favorite track on this album. Each one has its own distinct personality, yet they all flow together seamlessly. However, if I had to choose, I would say ""Lover's Spit"" is the standout. This slow-burning ballad is the perfect showcase for Drew's raw vocals and the band's ability to create an atmosphere of longing and melancholy.

What's impressive about this album is how well it has aged. Despite being almost 20 years old, it still sounds fresh and relevant. This is a testament to the band's talent and the timelessness of good music. 

Overall, ""You Forgot It in People"" is a masterpiece of modern rock music. It's not afraid to experiment with different sounds and styles, yet it never loses sight of its core appeal. It's powerful, it's emotional, and it's a must-listen for fans of the genre. I highly recommend it.","1.

Gang Gang Dance,Hillulah,Experimental,6.9,August 16 2005,Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,"Initially released as a limited edition CD-R for a November 2004 tour with Animal Collective, this 33-minute collage stitches together four live shows recorded between mid-2003 and early 2004 at the Knitting Factory, North Six, Passerby, and the Cooler (RIP), and includes an additional 30-plus minutes of live video footage. Don't expect Bruce Springsteen's Live 1975-85: Hillulah isn't a straight-up archive. Treating the recordings like found material, drummer Tim Dewitt spliced and shifted hours of two-track audio into these extensions, and like most of GGD's best work, the rhythmic incantations are hermetically removed from the everyday, so cheers and other live-album trappings are minimal. Stylistically, the four pieces phase through and reintroduce sounds contained on each GGD release: broken dub, colorful piano embellishments, blurred calypso, oxygen-deprived hiccups, island wattles, prismatic fractures, Fluxus sutures, earthy drum circles, etc. At one point Lizzy Bougatsos dives into a cavern after engaging in Tourette's syndrome howls with an unspecified male, astride electronic bleeps, drumstick rattles, and guitar blooms. Elsewhere, guest vocalist Sean Reveron of A Gun Called Tension shouts post-punk vitriol alongside boorish implosion. Occasionally, bits of instrumentation are trashed (like a dropped second), offering the feel of a loop (or lope). Percussion accelerates, tapping a constant, techno-friendly palpitation. For genealogy completists, Hillulah glances outside the studio and practice room, suggesting multiple bridges between 2001's Revival of the Shittest, the self-titled Fusetron LP, and God's Money. Personally, I like that it was compiled over just three days, because as one might expect, the transitions are at times sketchy, the movements not entirely in-synch. Looseness is its charm. In that sense, Hillulah supplies imperfect (and pretty) off-the-cuff glances at Gang Gang Dance's past, but realistically speaking, it's a documentation for diehards, not curiosity seekers.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3649-hillulah/,Social Registry,2005.0,"Hello music lovers! Today, I am here to talk about the mesmerizing and innovative album 'Hillulah' by Gang Gang Dance. As someone who has always been a fan of experimental music, I was excited to dive into this album and explore their unique sound.

To understand the significance of this album, let's first delve into the band's history. Gang Gang Dance was formed in 2001 by Lizzi Bougatsos, Josh Diamond, Tim DeWit, and Brian DeGraw. They have since released several critically acclaimed albums that showcase their eclectic blend of genres like electronic, world music, and experimental rock. Their music is characterized by its hypnotic rhythms, intricate instrumentation, and Bougatsos' hypnotic vocals.

'Hillulah,' their 2011 album, stands out as a masterpiece in their discography. The album was created during a time when the band members were experiencing personal growth and change. It was recorded in various locations, including Morocco and New York, providing an exotic and diverse sonic landscape that is a hallmark of the album.

From the opening track ""Glass Jar,"" the listener is transported to a new and ethereal world of sound. The song slowly builds up momentum before exploding into an epic and cathartic chorus. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly makes this song so captivating, but it's undeniably powerful and evocative.

The album's title track ""Hillulah"" is another standout track that showcases the band's unique sound. The song features mesmerizing drums, Middle Eastern-inspired melodies, and Bougatsos' haunting vocals. The pulsating synths and rhythms in ""Chinese High"" create a trance-like atmosphere that perfectly encapsulates the band's experimental spirit.

Overall, 'Hillulah' is a captivating and boundary-pushing album that is a must-listen for fans of experimental music. I personally love how this album is as much about the journey as it is about the destination. It takes you on a sonic adventure, inviting you to explore and immerse yourself in its intricate soundscapes.

In conclusion, if you're looking for an album that challenges convention and pushes the boundaries of what music can be, then 'Hillulah' by Gang Gang Dance is the perfect choice.

Richard Davies,Barbarians,Pop/R&B,7.3,June 20 2000,Paul Cooper,Contributor,"Of the many catalogs that clog my mailbox, my favorite by far is the quarterly Ikea tome. I've learnt so much (and bought so little!) from its glossy, stark pages. For instance, when I'm next in Stockholm (no doubt checking out a Svek Records showcase), I'll be able to converse in faltering Ikean Swedish. I'll be able to discuss how much joy I get from my five-inch tall Snorra Kanin (or ""plush bunny,"" in our vernacular). But I'll never learn the correct equivalent of ""lovingly crafted,"" ""expertly finished,"" or ""lifetime guarantee."" This upsets me because I would love to describe Richard Davies' raw, predictably over-achieving new album in the resilient language of home decorating. But though Barbarians arrives in flat packaging, no assembly is required. Davies and his band have abandoned the polished production of 1998's Telegraph in favor of a live-sounding, plug-and-play ambience. Here, Davies provides critics with yet more reasons to throw laurels his way, and still further incentive for the public to ignore his obvious talents. Like the Loud Family's Scott Miller, Davies makes songwriting seem a complete doddle. Whereas less talented songwriters might crowd a song with clunky lyrics and noodly melodic digressions, Barbarians showcases Davies' effortless ability to extract straightforward hooks from guitar strings, with no extraneous nonsense to get in the way. Despite the fact that Barbarians never provides an ear-melting classic like Telegraph's ""Canteen,"" I'm more than satisfied bugging out to the dominating echo that becomes a melody during the flawless ""Palo Alto,"" or the twanged and cracked arpeggios of the album's opener, ""Coldest Day."" ""The Kiss Off"" exhibits paisley influences with a bassline that recalls the Incredible String Band's lysergic hey-nonney-no. And who could not be impressed with ""May,"" a song so striking it could have been part of Tim Buckley's Dream Letter set? When I saw Davies perform in a tiny D.C. club, he filled the room with his panache. He didn't need to fall back on studio trickery. Up on the slightly raised stage, he flaunted his gift and his unmistakable love of music. Barbarians is a wake-up call to all those who labor in studios for a unique, fuzzing guitar sound. If your songwriting goes to eleven like Richard Davies' does, you just need to be heard, and certainly do not deserve to be left on the prefabricated chip-board of under-appreciation.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2183-barbarians/,"Kindercore,Kindercore",,"Welcome, music lovers! Today, we're diving into Richard Davies' latest release, ""Barbarians"". I've eagerly awaited this album, as I've been a fan of its creator's work since his early days. Davies' music is always on repeat on my playlist. His blend of Pop/R&B is one of a kind, and I was excited to experience it once again.

The album features 10 tracks that seamlessly intertwine to create an immersive listening experience. From up-tempo tracks to slower grooves, this album possesses everything I've come to expect from Richard Davies. His unique style transcends musical genres, moving beyond pop or R&B.

He sets the tone with the opening track, ""Love & War"", a track that tackles relationships and the difficulties of maintaining a connection. The song's smooth grooves offer a soothing backdrop to its lyrics. ""Love & War"" is followed by ""We Got This"", an up-tempo track that exudes confidence and optimism. It feels like an anthem, a song that uplifts you and makes you want to dance.

The album’s standout track, ""Higher Self"", is a delightful listen, with the artist reflecting on self-love and self-improvement. The song's sound design wonderfully complements its lyrics, housing an upbeat melody and rhythm that matches the artist's introspections.

Davies' experience and devotion to his music are evident throughout the album. His vocals are both soft and robust, bringing love ballads and soulful jams into new heights. Additionally, his writing style is seamlessly woven into his vocals, with the lyrics flowing smoothly and powerfully throughout.

Overall, this album's success comes down to how the artist crafted it. Davies' ability to balance his explorations of love, self-improvement, and the importance of resilience and perseverance is impressive. He passionately and consistently imbues his music with these themes, while still incorporating a wide range of sounds and musings.

In conclusion, Richard Davies' ""Barbarians"" is a testament to his musical prowess and the evolution of his sound. This album is an excellent example of Pop/R&B at its finest. It's stirring, entertaining, and engrossing, all at once. ""Barbarians"" earns a 7.5/10 in my books and should immediately be on your playlist. Happy listening, music lovers!","1.

Aluminium Group,Happyness,,8.0,November 7 2002,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Aluminum Group have been playing the DL for four albums now, consistently delivering the kind of smooth, sophisticated orchestra-pop that could only come from Chicago while managing to avoid the notoriety of hometown peers like The Sea & Cake. Happyness is their fifth album, and either I'm going old and developing a taste for vanilla, or the Aluminum Group continues to improve. Everything here is just so precise and fitted together so perfectly, not unlike the Ray Eames furniture line the band take their name from. Plenty of sweat went into the creation of Happyness, I'm sure, but none happened in real time. The music, melodies and arrangements have the kind effortless sheen that comes only from focused studio tinkering, and the result is a relaxing invitation to take in all the detail. One thing that makes the Aluminum Group interesting is they act like rock never happened. For John and Frank Navin, music jumped from the Bacharach/David/Warwick holy troika directly to the most melodic, new-romantic end of 80s synth-pop, and then took a short detour into mid-90s German electronics before dropping into the timeless realm where their records happen. They'd sooner retire to the Unabomber's cabin than bring a distortion pedal into the studio, and forget gravel-voiced angst. The Navins gargle and floss before every trip to the microphone, so don't bother with Happyness unless you're ready to meet the music on its own clearly defined terms. Befitting their perfectionist streak, this is a short and compact album, their third 10-song collection in a row, and it hovers just below the 40-minute mark. This is allegedly the first album in a trilogy, but the thematic direction is difficult to detect. The lyrics are still rife with literary allusions, arch turns of phrase, and tales of love and betrayal, but nothing unusual knits them together as far as I can hear. I can say that you'll enjoy the songs a lot more if you find lines like, ""It's springtime in Jellystone park,"" funny (like I do). Musically, Happyness is sparer than the recent work. If Pelo was an electronic excursion and Pedals found Aluminum Group indulging in acoustic chamber pop with Jim O'Rourke at the controls, Happyness incorporates hints of both approaches but tones the backing down. ""Kisses"" illustrates nicely the integrated approach, as a ringing synth patch forms the basis of the tune, but accents and rhythmic thrust are provided by a cool-as-a-snowcone muted trumpet. Despite impressive electronic accents, the arrangement seems designed for the kind of mid-60s crowd that agreed with Frank Sinatra about Elvis Presley. Whatever you think about the Aluminum Group's mad reverence for the AM radio pop of '65-'74, there's no denying the strength of these melodies, and this is why we have to take these guys seriously. These are damn good songs. Like Lord Bacharach, the Navins know how to string together a verse, bridge and chorus, each with ample melody to power its own tune (""Pop"" here is particularly impressive in this respect.) Hear most of these songs a few times and you'll feel like you've known them all your life. And if you find yourself in the mood for some smart pop music that hits all the right notes, you could do a lot worse.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/141-happyness/,Wishing Tree,2002.0,"What makes an album truly great? For me, it's when the music speaks to your soul and connects with you on a deeper level. Aluminium Group's ""Happyness"" accomplishes just that. This nan album, with a solid rating of 8.0 out of 10, traces back its roots to the early 2000s.

Formed by brothers Frank and John Navin, the Aluminium Group has been creating music for over two decades. The Navin brothers have always had a knack for blending the perfect chords and exceptional lyrics to create music that is both compelling and unique. With ""Happyness,"" they have managed to capture the essence of their sound and what makes them stand out in the crowded world of nan.

The making of ""Happyness"" was an organic process that took over two years. The album was recorded in many different settings, from bedrooms to studios, and with a variety of musicians. That diversity can be heard in the carefully crafted melodies and harmonies that create the foundation for the album. The instrumentation is a mix of acoustic and electronic sounds, giving the music freshness and depth.

At first listen, ""Happyness"" feels lighthearted and upbeat, but it's much more than that. The songs are hypnotic, transcendent, and immersive, carrying listeners through a spectrum of emotions. It's a perfect album to lose oneself in and contemplate the ever-changing nature of the human experience.

My favorite track is ""Summerboat,"" which takes me back to my childhood summers spent at the lake. The delicate guitar rhythms mixed with the dreamy synths make it a perfect track to listen to while lounging in the sun, watching the clouds go by. 

""Happyness"" isn't just an album; it's a portal that allows us to explore the human condition through music. The nuanced energy and poetic lyrics capture the euphoria of sunlight on a summer day, the wistful memories of lost love, and even the melancholy of a rainy day. Through it all, the Aluminium Group effortlessly showcases their talent and skill, creating music that is as thought-provoking as it is enjoyable.

In conclusion, ""Happyness"" by Aluminium Group is an exceptional nan album that must be experienced to be fully appreciated. The Navin brothers have outdone themselves with this album, creating a soundscape that is both soothing and thought-provoking, ensuring that any journey you take while listening to the album will be one to remember.","1.

Death Grips,Interview 2016,"Experimental,Rap",7.0,April 7 2016,Zoe Camp,Contributor,"Death Grips aren’t above ditching highly-anticipated festival appearances. They didn’t lose sleep after sabotaging their own record deal, and they sure didn’t mind selling thousands of tickets for concerts they never intended on playing in the first place. By any reasonable standard, this band doesn’t give a shit. So it’s been surprising that, in recent months, Death Grips have actually shown generosity to their fans, punctuating the interim between proper albums with low-stakes instrumental work. In the opening weeks of 2015, the band preceded Jenny Death  with a full-length “soundtrack“ titled Fashion Week. At roughly 48 minutes (the second-longest runtime in Death Grips’ catalog after Exmilitary), it certainly had the bulk of a typical album, but the absence of frontman MC Ride, their furious heart and anguished soul, ultimately rendered Fashion Week unnecessary. And now, just prior to the release of their next album, Bottomless Pit, comes another unusual instrumental release: “Interview 2016,” a 32-minute clip that depicts the band playing for actor/TV host Matthew Hoffman in a darkened room before sitting down for a conversation. Had the band not legitimized the soundtrack by uploading it to SoundCloud (and later, other streaming sites), the release would probably be written off as a curio, rather than an entry in the Death Grips canon. Now that it’s isolated, we can see Interview 2016 for what really is: an instrumental EP that abandons Fashion Week’s uneventful expanses for a cramped space that shows Death Grips in confrontational mode. As with the last soundtrack, MC Ride’s absence diminishes Interview’s intensity, but its brevity gives them space to compensate, narrowing the focus for a sharper sound. Other than the ambient interlude “Interview E,” the EP mainly sees Zach Hill and Andy Morin doubling down on Jenny Death’s unhinged hardcore with a proliferation of over-driven drums and basslines that seem as if they’re fired from from a Gatling gun. And even though there’s not a clear human voice in the mix (save from a quick “Hi Everybody!” in “Interview F”), the instruments do plenty of talking. Listen closely to the slippery percussive sample smattered across “Interview C,” or the barking undercurrent of “Interview F:” the effects themselves are undeniably alien, but they still manage to communicate. The dynamic and varied arrangements keep the EP from slipping into a formlessness; “Interview B,” the standout of the set, periodically diverts to an eerie, faintly Eastern chorus that pops open suddenly like a trap-door into the void. And lest the din grow dull on punishing cuts like “Interview A” and “Interview D,“ Hill and Morin temper the racket ever-so-slightly through silvery, distant-sounding refrains that comfort even as they contort, like possessed library music. They even transmogrify Hill’s drum fills into an arpeggiating melody on “Interview C.” While MC Ride might be perceived as the alpha and omega of Death Grips, Interview 2016 underscores that Hill and Morin are quite formidable on their own. This release is far more interesting than Fashion Week, a full-length twice its size, and it suggests that Death Grips' strength as an instrumental entity shouldn’t be underestimated.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21796-interview-2016/,Third Worlds,2016.0,"If you're a fan of experimental music that's unafraid to push boundaries, you're likely already familiar with Death Grips. The Sacramento-based trio has been making waves in the underground rap scene for years, thanks to their raw energy and genre-defying sound. Their latest album, Interview 2016, is no exception to their rule-breaking ways, and proves that they're still one of the most exciting acts in music today.

If you're unfamiliar with Death Grips, it's worth taking a moment to understand their history. The band is made up of vocalist MC Ride, drummer Zach Hill, and producer Andy Morin. They burst onto the scene in 2011 with their debut album, Exmilitary, which earned them a cult following and critical acclaim. Since then, they've continued to challenge expectations with each album, incorporating elements of rock, electronic, and even noise music into their unique sound.

Interview 2016 was recorded during a tumultuous time for the band. At the end of 2015, they announced that they were breaking up, only to surprise everyone by releasing a new album a few months later. The album was originally supposed to be an accompaniment to a documentary about the band, but ended up being released on its own after the film was delayed. Despite the chaotic circumstances surrounding its creation, Interview 2016 is a cohesive and compelling album that showcases the band at their best.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Hot Head"", which features an aggressive, distorted beat that builds to a frenzied climax. MC Ride's vocals are as intense as ever, with his trademark snarl cutting through the chaotic instrumentation. The song feels like a sonic assault, leaving you feeling exhilarated and slightly disoriented. It's the kind of track that would be right at home in a mosh pit.

Another highlight is ""Eh"", which features a hypnotic, looping beat and a catchy hook that will get stuck in your head for days. The song is a bit more subdued than some of the other tracks on the album, but no less impactful. MC Ride's delivery is more restrained here, but no less impactful. It's a reminder that Death Grips can be just as effective when they're dialing things back as when they're going all out.

Overall, Interview 2016 is a strong addition to Death Grips' discography. While it may not be their most groundbreaking work, it's a testament to their continued relevance and creativity. Fans of the band will find plenty to love here, and newcomers will be intrigued by the group's unique sound and unapologetic attitude. At a time when so much of popular music feels formulaic and safe, it's refreshing to have a band that's willing to take risks and challenge expectations. For that reason alone, Interview 2016 is worth a listen.","1.

Willow,The 1st,Pop/R&B,6.7,November 9 2017,Cameron Cook,Contributor,"Willow Smith has spent the entirety of her career in the limelight. It’s been eclectic and interesting, if not always stellar. Willow is clearly not interested in being a Top 40 popstar, though her stabs at higher consciousness through futuristic R&B have lacked the nuance of her more acclaimed peers. With her second album, the 17-year-old Willow faces the daunting task of avoiding a sophomore slump while having already reinvented herself twice before even graduating high school. At this point, anything remotely musically challenging would be a relative win. But in a welcome turn of events, The 1st sees her leave the humdrum Soundcloud electrobeats well behind, opting instead for something more organic, substantial, and raw. These are all qualities that actually enhance her millennial-new-age persona instead of tempering it. Upon first glance, the album still suffers from the same thematic editing issues that have always hampered the songs she writes. Opener “Boy” begins with the bluntly adolescent lyricism that gave her last album, Ardipithecus, its amateurish air: “Hey mom, I met a boy/He plays guitar/He likes Quentin Tarantino/And really sad songs.” It aims for “Leader of the Pack,” but sounds more like a saccharine diary entry. But Willow displays a clear desire to grow as an artist and see her creative potential realized. As the album unfurls, each track digs deeper into this new down-to-earth, acoustic sound that seems tailor-made for her personal and reflective songwriting. “Boy” announces this tonal shift with plucked violins and lush strings, its pacing languid and relaxed. Willow’s voice settles into a throaty contralto, recalling Fiona Apple’s jazz-flecked vocals on Tidal. In fact, for an album made by someone who wasn’t even born during the decade, The 1st is a surprisingly adept compendium of alternative female singer-songwriters of the 1990s. “And Contentment,” which features Willow on guitar, respectfully culls from Tracy Chapman’s introspective folk. The light grunge, crunchy guitar riffs, and strident vocals of “Human Leech” recall Alanis Morissette’s razor-sharp pop angst. An easy highlight, “Warm Honey” takes the indie rock breakbeats of Luscious Jackson and infuses them with Erykah Badu’s early mix of lilting R&B and esoteric imagery (“The universe is too bright/Light beams in the sky speaking to my third eye”). Willow knows she’s talented and she knows that, due to her status, she has to prove that talent twice as much as anyone else. That The 1st is able to somewhat shed its lyrical blemishes within the first few tracks—evolving into a measured, intelligent, laid back soul-rock record—speaks to the tenacity with which Willow pursues her artistic goals. On much of The 1st, it sounds like Willow is still figuring out her own creative persona—the guitar playing on “Romance” feels simplistic, and tracks like the repetitive “Oh No!!!” bog down what would otherwise be a fresh sound. That said, Willow is clearly biding her time, searching for the optimal self. The 1st represents a huge leap in the right direction.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/willow-the-1st/,"MSFTSMusic,Roc Nation",2017.0,"If you're looking for something new and refreshing in the pop/R&B world, you'll want to give Willow's latest album, 'The 1st', a listen. Willow, also known as Willow Smith, is a multi-talented artist who has been in the industry since a young age. Her debut single, ""Whip My Hair,"" caught everybody's attention back in 2010, and since then, she has continued to surprise us with her creativity and versatility. 

Now, Willow is taking a step back from the mainstream music scene with her third album, 'The 1st'. This album is a departure from her previous work - it's stripped back, honest, and raw. Willow wrote and produced the album herself, and you can hear how personal it is in every song. 

The first thing that struck me about 'The 1st' is how Willow's vocals have matured. Her voice is deeper and more soulful than before, and it suits the stripped-back instrumentals perfectly. I was impressed by how she experiments with different genres, blending jazz and neo-soul influences seamlessly throughout the album. 

While the entire album is worth a listen, some standout tracks for me include ""Boy"" and ""Lonely Road"". ""Boy"" is a beautiful ballad that showcases Willow's vulnerability and raw emotions. Meanwhile, ""Lonely Road"" has a driving beat and a catchy chorus that will have you humming along before you know it. 

Overall, I found 'The 1st' to be a thoughtful and introspective album that deserves your attention. It's not your typical pop/R&B offering, but that's what makes it stand out. Willow has taken a risk with this album, and I think it's paid off. While I wouldn't rate it a perfect 10, I would give it a solid 6.7 out of 10. If you're looking for an album that will make you feel something, give 'The 1st' a listen.","1.

Club 8,The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming,Rock,7.6,January 7 2008,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"Early in 2007, Swedish label Labrador released its 10th-anniversary compilation, A Complete History of Popular Music. Better add another chapter. Stockholm's Club 8 consist of composer/multi-instrumentalist Johan Angergård-- who runs Labrador, fronts the Legends, and is a member of Acid House Kings-- and vocalist Karolina Komstedt. The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming is their sixth album, and though it's not a dramatic stylistic shift like some of the duo's previous discs, it's a warm, tender-hearted acoustic pop record, one that emotes through simplicity and gut-punching melodic turns rather than stagy histrionics. It's also Club 8's second album named after a song by the Television Personalities, following 2003's Strangely Beautiful. Like those underrated English post-punks, the Swedish duo have always been unashamedly sensitive, but The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming has little of its namesakes' insular humor or moddish amphetamine edge. The faster songs, such as first singles ""Heaven"" and ""Whatever You Want"", use everyday language to convey social anxiety and existential pangs, countered by sprightly acoustic strums, organs, bongos, shakers, or whistling. A girl-group bass line and summery organs bring ""Football Kids"" the lonely charm of Glaswegian indie-popsters Camera Obscura, while ""When I Come Around"" is a sort of alternate perspective on Morrissey's ""Suedehead"", with Komstedt cooing casual come-ons to a lover whose dude is away: ""I have no promises to keep/ Double bed where no one sleeps/ Now it's up to you."" The organic instrumentation marks a turn from Club 8's recent run of electronic-oriented albums following Sarah Records-inspired 1996 debut Nouvelle. Though the uptempo numbers are the obvious singles, it's the more somber material that allows The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming to work as an album. As on another of 2006's best Swedish records, Victoria Bergsman's Björn Yttling-produced Taken By Trees debut Open Field, slower tracks like ""Leave the North"" or ""In the Morning"" put vast, wintry spaces around direct, bedsit-style songwriting, achieving subtle grandeur through the way the way Komstedt's voice sighs from amid rumbling piano or echoey handclaps. Depressive ""Hopes and Dreams"" gives up some of the opening tracks' momentum, but it's needed to set up the bass-driven melancholia of ""Everything Goes"", which swears off hopes, dreams, and faith while imagining ""a warm day in heaven."" Opener ""Jesus, Walk With Me"", like much of the album, represents an attempt to reconcile the beautiful ideal of faith (and the deep human need for, as the Television Personalities put it, ""someone to share my life with"") against secular modernity's skepticism: ""Fool me into believing/ I don't care if you're deceiving me/ Before I go I need to be/ something more than the skin and bones you see."" The words could be a metaphor for what we look for from pop singers, too. The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming convinces, and that's good news to be shared and stuck on some future Labrador anniversary comp. It ends as we'll be lucky if our own lives and loves (let alone dreams) do, with a goodbye.

This rock masterpiece has a unique sound and energy that instantly drew me in and kept me hooked. The album's rating of 7.6 out of 10 barely does it justice.

Club 8 is a band that has been around since the early 1990s and has had a loyal following ever since. The band has continued to evolve and grow musically with each new release, and this album is no exception. The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming is a labor of love that the band worked tirelessly on, and the result is an album that exceeds all expectations.

The album opens with a bang with the track ""Jesus, Walk with Me,"" which is beautifully produced and showcases the band's talents. The track is an optimistic anthem that sets the tone for the rest of the album. From there, the album takes you on a journey, with each track offering a unique and different experience.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Whatever You Want,"" a catchy tune that has a delightful hook that will make you want to put it on repeat. The vocals are solid and memorable, and the guitar riffs are fantastic. But what really sets this track apart is the way it makes you feel – joyful, free, and full of life.

As for the rest of the album, it really continues to impress. The band's sound is distinct and polished, and the lyrics are thoughtful and meaningful. The album flows seamlessly from one track to the next, with each song offering something new.

In my experience, The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming by Club 8 is a must-listen for any music lover. The album is a testament to the band's talent and dedication, and it offers an experience that is both deeply personal and universally relatable.

Marah,"20,000 Streets Under the Sky",Rock,7.5,June 28 2004,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"One of the most geographically defined bands around, Philadelphia's Marah look to Bruce Springsteen the same way the Drive-By Truckers view Lynyrd Skynyrd: as a specifically regional influence. For brothers and band mainstays Dave and Serge Bielanko, The Boss-- with his word-dense songs, layered sound, and romantic conviction in rock 'n' roll's redemptive powers-- is just as much a Mid-Atlantic birthright as the Van Zant brothers are to Southerners like Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley. While the Truckers, however, have received mostly praise for their double album about Skynyrd's career, Marah have received mostly jibes and pans for their E Street obsession. For one thing, Springsteen is still alive and touring, thus defying easy mythologizing, and he is generally thought of less as a Mid-Atlantic artist and more as simply an American one. Furthermore, having no Faulkner nor Delta blues, the Mid-Atlantic region-- the eastern Pennsylvania wasteland, most of New Jersey, all of clotted Delaware, parts of Maryland, and, some claim, a few acres in West Virginia-- is neither as defined in the public conscience nor as storied as the South, despite its very particular history and culture. Under the crushing weight of critical and commercial apathy (their first two albums should have been classics), Marah left the Mid-Atlantic altogether and recorded their ill-fated third album, Float Away with the Friday Night Gods, with Oasis producer Owen Morris, who turned their timeless urban rock into the kind of anthemic electro-sludge that was already out of date by 1995. Still, it was never as bad as its detractors (most of whom were former fans) claimed, with Dave's songwriting-- especially on ""Crying on an Airplane""-- softening the winces. Plus, there's always the possibility of a future live album to salvage those tracks. If Float Away proved anything, it was what the Bielanko brothers set out expressly to disprove: You can take the kids out of Philly, but you can't take Philly out of the kids. For their fourth album, 20,000 Streets Under the Sky, Marah return to their southside garage studio, not just as a recording site but as a setting for their gritty urban narratives. They're scarred but smarter (to quote another Skynyrd-inspired southern rock band, Drivin' N' Cryin'), knowing what works and still trying not to be tied to it. One song, ""Goin' Through the Motions"", even hints at what Float Away could have been had they produced Float Away on this side of the Atlantic. The lead-off track, ""East"", therefore, could be a kiss-off to fickle fans who cried sell-out when the band caught that transatlantic flight: ""East is all I need to finally start to feel defined."" Even as it yearns for points beyond the Delaware Bay (New Jersey? Ireland?), the song is anchored specifically in Philadelphia, as Dave describes the rumble of cars on I-95 and the jumble of people on South Street. Likewise, the entire album absorbs Philadelphiana like a sponge: car alarms and cat calls sound between songs, an errant trumpet introducing one track. The monumental ""Freedom Park"" even sets its tale of big-city bleakness against local girls chanting jump-rope jingles, transforming their sing-song rhythms into a lively gospel chorus. Marah's sound is fondly local, incorporating doo-wop, Philly soul, funk, and ambitious Springsteenisms (all those bells and saxes) in a restless depiction of the city as a place where neighborhoods are still defined and demarcated ethnically, and Dave writes songs to match. ""Feather Boa"" is a standout, a tale of a hard-luck transvestite who fears violence and death around every corner. It's a frank depiction of trying to pass, with some of Dave's best street poetry: ""Scratch card rub off silver/ Is the jewel beneath his nails/ His skin is bar room shark fin/ His lashes are sardine tails."" On the chorus he sings, ""This dick between my legs just makes me cry,"" giving the words the gutpunch impact of the last line of ""Round Eye Blues"". And if the second half of 20,000 Streets emphasizes Dave's threadbare vocals in overreaching anthems like ""Soda"", Marah at least bolster them with imaginative accompaniment. Granted, ""Pizzeria"" would probably sound better with Dave singing instead of Serge, but then again, his clearly affectionate vocals, while a bit thin in his overenunciation, at least preserve the album's casual vibe, as if performing these songs in some dingy Philly club for a few friends and family. 20,000 Streets isn't a comeback-- it's a homecoming.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5102-20000-streets-under-the-sky/,Yep Roc,2004.0,"If there's one thing we all know about rock music, it's that the best rock bands are the ones who really understand how to tap into the raw, visceral energy that drives the genre forward. And with their latest release, ""20,000 Streets Under the Sky,"" Marah proves once again that they are one of the finest purveyors of soulful rock and roll working today.

For those who may not be familiar, Marah first burst onto the scene in the early 2000s with their critically acclaimed album ""Kids in Philly,"" which drew comparisons to classic rock acts like Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty while still maintaining a sound that was distinctly their own. Since then, they've continued to evolve their sound with each successive album, blending punk, folk, and even Americana influences into a cohesive and powerful sonic tapestry. And with ""20,000 Streets Under the Sky,"" they've made one of their most memorable and emotionally affecting albums yet.

The album's creation story is one of those tales that sound like they could have come straight out of a rock legend's playbook. According to the band, they recorded the album in a live, one-take session in a decrepit, abandoned church in Philadelphia. The acoustics of the church lent an otherworldly quality to the recordings, infusing them with a sense of ragged, haunted beauty. And as a listener, it's easy to hear the power of that environment suffusing every note and every lyric.

From the opening notes of ""The Hustle,"" the first track on the album, it's clear that Marah have something powerful to say. Singer Dave Bielanko's voice is equal parts grit and soul, channeling equal parts of Springsteen and Shane MacGowan as he croons over a bed of jangly guitars and pulsing drums. There's a feeling of urgency to the music that permeates every track, as if the band know they only have one shot to make each song count.

Personal experience-wise, I have to say that this album has hit me hard on a number of levels. As someone who grew up in the shadow of Philadelphia, the city that birthed Marah and inspired so much of their music, there's a deep sense of connection that I feel to these songs. Hearing them play off one another in real-time on this record feels like the closest approximation possible to getting to see them live.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""City of Dreams,"" a song that captures the gritty, hopeful energy that defines Philly so well. Over a propulsive rhythm and chiming chords, Bielanko sings of a city that's equal parts beautiful and ugly, a place where dreams are both made and dashed on a daily basis. It's a hard-hitting, emotionally charged track that never ceases to give me goosebumps, no matter how many times I've heard it.

Overall, I'd give ""20,000 Streets Under the Sky"" a solid 7.5 out of 10. It's an album that demands your attention, and rewards repeated listens with its intricacy and depth. With each successive track, Marah prove themselves to be masters of their craft, tapping into the heart and soul of rock music in a way that few other bands can. Whether you're a longtime fan or discovering them for the first time, this album is a must-hear.","1.

The Tears,Here Come the Tears,Pop/R&B,7.0,June 19 2005,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"For two albums, Brett Anderson and Bernard seemed as if they could grow to become the Morrissey & Marr of the 90s-- Suede's self-titled debut and its follow-up, Dog Man Star, are among the best records of Britpop, and even the B-sides they wrote together were pretty consistently amazing songs. The fraying and ultimate disintegration of their creative relationship pushed Dog Man Star to its final gloriously turgid, expansive state, with each musician trying to muscle his best ideas to the front. That album isn't just a collection of a band's recently written songs, it's a sweeping picture of despair and interpersonal meltdown. Post-Butler, Suede distanced themselves from that sound, opting instead to become a sort of gutter party band. The catharsis seemed to sap Butler as well-- his solo records are only a song or two removed from totally mediocre, and aside from ""Yes"" I'd rather not think about his collaboration with David McAlmont. Ten years later, Suede are dead, Butler's way under the radar and here come the Tears, the official reunion of Anderson & Butler. It's a reunion that's been about as low-key as a reunion between these two could possibly be, given that Suede were once so huge that Virgin Megastores across Britain changed their name to Head Music for a day to mark the release of the band's fourth album. Listening to the results, it seems as though they genuinely enjoy working together again-- when Anderson refers to ""you and me"" on ""Two Creatures"" and talks about running away to warmer weather in Africa, it almost sounds like he's talking to Butler and not some anonymous girlfriend as the guitarist's distinctively dissonant leads snake alongside his vocal. That amity is perhaps a part of the reason Here Come the Tears doesn't quite measure up to the duo's past together-- the seething tension and bitchy moodiness of their original partnership undeniably made the music better and more intense. The other reason things aren't quite as transcendent this time is the more mundane matter of Brett Anderson-- he's selling his voice to tobacconists on an installment plan and can't do melodrama like he used to. Plus, years of frequently lazy lyric writing with Suede Mk II haven't entirely cleared up. That said, there also are no songs that simply list the ways in which various unrelated people are decadent and none that string together references to gasoline, diesel, alcohol, polythene, and trash in a random sequence. Removed from the context of their past work (ha!), Here Come the Tears is a good album, one with the respective drum and bass work of Mako Sakamoto and Nathan Fisher grounding sweeping ballads like ""Apollo 13"" and driving the speedier songs solidly so that Butler's guitar is free to roam, jousting with the vocal melodies. Butler is still an impressive guitarist-- his solo on ""Lovers"" is a particular highlight. Other hallmarks of the classic Dog Man Star-era sound that surface here include the wandering, Leslie'd pianos and smearing, slightly antagonistic string arrangements, which are held back for just the right moments. So color me pleasantly surprised-- I really expected very little from an Anderson/Butler reunion, but they've ably demonstrated that my old-guard Suede fan anxiety was unfounded with catchy, dramatic songs like ""Imperfections"" and ""Lovers"". There's nothing as great as ""New Generation"", ""She's Not Dead"", or ""The 2 of Us"" but there doesn't have to be, either, because the Tears have enough natural dynamism of their own to stand alone.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8295-here-come-the-tears/,Independiente,2005.0,"If you haven't heard of The Tears, you may be surprised to learn that they're actually a collaboration between two former members of Britpop legends Suede: Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler. Here Come the Tears, released in 2005, is their first and only album, and it's a pop/R&B gem that showcases the duo's songwriting and musical prowess.

Prior to The Tears, Anderson and Butler were once bandmates in Suede, but their creative partnership fell apart soon after their debut album due to personal disagreements. When they first announced their reunion in 2004, fans were elated to hear that they would be making music together once again. With the release of Here Come the Tears, it's safe to say that they did not disappoint.

The album's creation story is a fascinating one. The Tears had initially set out to make a record that would ""rip peoples' heads off"" -- a bold ambition if there ever was one. Through a series of misadventures and miscommunications, the album's direction ended up taking a different turn. Anderson said that there were some ""confusions and crossed wires,"" and they ended up making a record that was a bit more introspective and personal than they had originally planned.

And yet, what emerged from those early sessions is a record that still manages to pack a punch. The opening track, ""Refugees,"" sets the tone for the album with its soaring guitars and catchy chorus. ""A Love as Strong as Death"" is a ballad that showcases Anderson's voice at its best, while ""Two Creatures"" is a lush and melodic track that highlights Butler's knack for creating intricate guitar arrangements.

Despite the fact that Here Come the Tears is a pop/R&B album, it still manages to sound uniquely British. There are moments of swagger and bravado, but the album also has a melancholic streak that is often associated with the best music from the UK. While it may not have been the record that Anderson and Butler initially set out to create, Here Come the Tears is undoubtedly a strong and memorable debut for the band.

As for my personal experience with the album, I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical at first. I had always been a fan of Suede, but I wasn't sure if their post-Suede collaboration would live up to the hype. However, after listening to Here Come the Tears multiple times, I have come to appreciate it on its own merits. The songs are well-crafted, the production is slick, and Anderson and Butler's musical chemistry is evident on every track.

Overall, I would give Here Come the Tears a rating of 7.0 out of 10. While it may not be a perfect album, it's definitely worth a listen for anyone who is a fan of either Suede or Anderson and Butler's individual work. With its blend of pop hooks and R&B grooves, Here Come the Tears is a unique and enjoyable record that deserves more recognition than it has received.","1.

Magic Bullets,Much Ado About EP,Pop/R&B,6.2,April 9 2012,Zach Kelly,Contributor,"Magic Bullets are no more. After playing a final gig in their native San Francisco last August, the Mon Amie indie pop five-piece decided to hang it up after seven years of jangle. Much Ado About, their new EP, will serve as the band's farewell (for now, at least), offering one last rattle through Anglophilic guitar pop for us all to remember them by. Magic Bullets' previous release, their solid, self-titled second effort, found their name being uttered in the same breath as like-minded acts Wild Nothing and the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, another addition to a very gentle C86 revival. Alas, it was not meant to be (though to be honest, aren't we always kind of in the midst of a C86 revival?). So if this is the Bullets' Strangeways Here We Come, the feeling is much more ""Death at One's Elbow"" than ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"", for better or worse. Whereas Magic Bullets was multifaceted in its ability to impart some of its thematic lovesickness into the actual music, Much Ado About is a more blatantly sunny affair. So for those who found a melancholy kind of joy in being barely able to scrape themselves off the floor to the tune of ""They Wrote a Song About You"", it should be noted that there is precious little time for that here. The seven (very similar) songs offered up are unguardedly sweet, with their tumbling drums and sprightly guitars. This is, by all accounts, music made for Sunday bike rides, and it's hard to actively dislike in the same way that it's hard to actively dislike watching a three-legged race. So needless to say, if you don't care for Sunday bike rides or three-legged races, stay the hell away from this. But no matter your disposition, do stay for the guitars. Corey Cunningham is still able to take time-honored licks (yes, there's a lot of Johnny Marr tucked into these songs) and make them sound unique and refreshing. If only the remaining Bullets had followed suit: Lead singer Philip Benson seems to go out of his way to avoid the more theatrical phrasings that helped give the material on Magic Bullets some bite, and the rest of the band seems to join in, taking a more direct, color-by-numbers approach. Which isn't to say that it's an unwelcome thing: ""Time and Again"" has a good-natured vibe that wouldn't feel out of place on a Woodsist comp, where ""What Took You So Long"" adopts an almost Shins-y look and ""Common House Cats"" translates as affable prom pop. But a lot of these songs have a weird jam-band quality that deprives them of any real depth or contrast-- tracks like opener ""Unlearned"" sound as though they were more inspired by Under the Table and Dreaming than anything to come out of dear ol' Blighty in the last 25 years. Much Ado About is an EP that requires the right kind of climate, and in all honesty would probably work best in the context of a mumblecore movie or, perhaps more troublingly, a ""How I Met You Mother"" montage. But it leaves on a real high note with the organ-augmented ""If You Touch Her"", which distills the EP's charms while imparting a needed edge. ""If you love her then stay away/ If you touch her there will be hell to pay,"" Benson sings. It's a good note to go out on, even if most of the teeth-baring here was the result of a mile-wide smile that, depending on your mood, would more readily invite a fist than a reciprocal grin. As a final statement, Much Ado About doesn't mean that we'll be missing Magic Bullets as terribly if they had called it quits in 2010, but it also doesn't mean that we won't be wishing them well on their way out.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16475-magic-bullets-much-ado-about-ep/,Mon Amie,2012.0,"Welcome to the world of Magic Bullets, the California-based Pop/R&B band that has been taking the music scene by storm with their latest EP, 'Much Ado About.' As an avid fan of this genre, I was eagerly waiting for this release, and I must say, the wait was worth it.

Magic Bullets might not be as well-known as other Pop/R&B bands out there, but trust me when I say that they have been creating music since the early 2000s. This band comprises a talented group of musicians who first came together in San Francisco - that one place that's known for nurturing impactful indie pop bands is renowned for its liberal attitudes and eclectic artistic community.

The group has had some significant changes over time, with only lead singer/songwriter Philip Benson and bassist/vocalist Nathan Sweatt being the only original band members remaining. Nevertheless, this hasn't stopped the band from continually creating fresh, new sounds that keep their fans mesmerized, including their latest work, ""Much Ado About,"" which has been generating buzz across the music scene.

One thing that stands out for me in the EP is the excellent production that truly brings out the best in each song. The smooth, crisp and sharp beats, coupled with Benson's mesmerizing vocals, make for an immersive listening experience. Every element is well thought out and creates a well-balanced sound.

In terms of the album's creation story, 'Much Ado About' is the result of a collaborative effort between the band and producer/engineer Ian Pellicci, who has worked with names like Rogue Wave, Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, and The Dodos. The result is a tastefully curated album with six tracks that stand out with an edgy, highly personal style that music lovers will quickly fall in love with.

As for my personal experience with the album, I must say that I enjoyed every bit of it. Songs like ""Yesterday's Seen Better Days"" and ""What Took You So Long?"" are exemplary pieces that enticed me with their power-packed beats and contagious choruses that quickly became lodged in my head. They have a way of getting you into a vibrant rhythm that undoubtedly fits any mood, and there was no way I was getting this album out of my head. Sure, some songs didn't hit it off for me, but I won't deny that the lyrics in each track were inspiring and relatable to me.

All in all, 'Much Ado About' is an excellent album that showcases Magic Bullet's undeniable talent and fresh sound. You might not be familiar with their name right now, but I guarantee you that after giving this album a listen, you won't stop singing their praises. So set aside some time and immerse yourself in this compelling and unforgettable EP.","1.

Monster Rally,Mystery Cove,Electronic,6.5,November 30 2016,Paul Thompson,Contributor,"Way back in the 10-cent bin, between the 40-odd copies of Whipped Cream & Other Delights and those “Sounds of Hawaii” records made exclusively by people who'd never set foot on Hawaii, Monster Rally’s Ted Feighan has found paradise. “Exotica,” we used to call it: “Space-age bachelor pad music,” that sort of thing. Feighan, having lifted dozens of samples from the original, often-warped wax, realigns them into a sparkling, sun-soaked collage, deftly sliding between opulent slack-key guitars, clattering breakbeats, and shimmering tropicalia, like the Avalanches stuck in Honolulu with visa issues, or the Caretaker on daquiri three. Mystery Cove, the fourth Monster Rally full-length, is pure, distilled escapism: 42 straight minutes of somewhere else, no SPF required. Feighan largely works in miniature—few Monster Rally tracks run too far past the two minute mark—without much apparent use for vocals. While early highlight “In the Valleys” lifts a few lines from hapa-haole classic “Lahainaluna,” the paucity of voices throughout the rest of Mystery Cove gives the disc its air of seclusion, a paradise far removed from the madding crowd. From chopped-not-slopped big band ditties (“Moondog”) to swanky hold music/“Hotline Bling” schmaltz (“Full Sail,” “After Hours”) to lusty, Herb Ritts-lensed sandblasters (“Tourismo”), this is transporting work. Mystery Cove isn’t a real place, but Feighan’s fondness for certain sounds (lounge, surf, slack-key guitar) sourced from a certain era (1948-1964, give or take) neatly conjures one anyway: beautiful people, endless beaches, fruit-based cocktails. Alas, like any vacation, Mystery Cove too often cuts things short just when they’re getting good. For all his curatorial prowess, Feighan tends to winnow down his Goodwill findings into 10-or-15 second chunks. There’s plenty of variation between the tracks, just not necessarily much within them; occasionally, a breakbeat is introduced, or a clip will run headlong into another, but the general rule seems to be “cut, spin, fade, repeat.” While that certainly keeps things moving, there’s rarely enough time within individual tracks to get acclimated to the scenery when Feighan’s anxiously clicking his way through the slideshow. As an exercise in vibe-sustainment, Mystery Cove is a knockout. To that end, it’s probably the most cohesive Monster Rally record to date: a Hawaiian shirt with an AUX input. But that cohesion comes comes at the cost of a bit of adventure; whereas 2013’s more baldly experimental Return to Paradise found Feighan drawing slivers of samba and sweeping mid-century soundtrack work into his world party, Mystery Cove rarely makes it too far off the Big Island. Most of us will take our escapism where we can get it nowadays, and Feighan’s only too happy to provide.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22651-mystery-cove/,Gold Robot,2016.0,"Upon listening to Monster Rally's latest album ""Mystery Cove"", I found myself lost in a soundscape that is both exotic and familiar at the same time. The electronic beats, infused with a variety of samples, create a unique atmosphere that transports you to a world of mystery and intrigue. 

For those not familiar with Monster Rally, it's a solo music project led by Ted Feighan. The Northern California native has an impressive discography spanning over a decade, and ""Mystery Cove"" is his latest experimental project. What first caught my attention as I delved into the album was the band's distinct use of vinyl samples and vintage sounds that invoke a sense of nostalgia.

Feighan's creative process for the album was inspired by the idea of creating a fictional cocktail lounge soundtrack. The album title itself is reflective of this concept, inviting listeners to lose themselves in a smoky, neon-lit cove filled with unexpected musical delights. One of the standout tracks on the album for me was ""The Big Surf"", featuring a sound that is reminiscent of an old spy movie, with added electronic elements that make it modern while still staying true to its classic sound.

Apart from its unique sound, ""Mystery Cove"" is also a nuanced album that showcases the depth of Feighan's production, making it a worthwhile listen for fans of IDM and ambient electronic music. While the beats are at times minimalistic, they are layered with intricate samples and snippets that give the album depth and dimension. 

Overall, ""Mystery Cove"" is an album that rewards those who give it a chance. With its experimental style and use of eclectic samples, it's not for everyone, but those with a taste for the avant-garde will find plenty to enjoy here. At a rating of 6.5 out of 10, the album may not quite achieve greatness, but it is still undeniably impressive, and certainly worth a listen.","1.

Nat Baldwin,In the Hollows,Experimental,5.7,May 8 2014,Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,"An upright bass-playing torch singer? The gist of Nat Baldwin’s music is more interesting than his membership in Dirty Projectors, the selling point his name has most often generated for much of the last decade. But by himself, or with any number of high-caliber collaborators, Baldwin is a singer/songwriter who employs his upright bass in much the same way as most people stuck to that tag use a piano, a guitar, or even a cello—to form the musical foundation for tense, impressionistic tunes. His fluttering, agile voice, capable of falsetto crests and valley-deep dives, only adds to the intrigue. As distinct as Baldwin’s approach seems, though, his music has typically fit into predictable indie songwriter circles. The movement of his voice, for instance, recalls that of lead Projector Dave Longstreth, particularly given how Baldwin condenses and stretches syllables during wild rhythmic runs. His light timbre suggests both Andrew Bird and Owen Pallett. In the past, however, he’s been able to veer left of such stylistic kin through impressive atmosphere (the enormous natural reverb that bathed 2008’s Most Valuable Player) or unexpected stylistic changes (the Elliott Carter-conducts-free jazz paroxysm that punctuated 2011’s People Changes). But on his latest, In the Hollows, Baldwin falls far into a quagmire of the expected, not only with vocals that take no new chances but also with a cast of collaborators that, however accomplished, scans like a cliché. Otto Hauser, for instance, is a brilliant percussionist, but his résumé of appearances—Vetiver, Devendra Banhart, Marissa Nadler, Vashti Bunyan—suggests that Baldwin is trying to pigeonhole himself stylistically. And then there’s the three-piece string section, lifted from New York ensemble yMusic, whose members have worked with the National, Bon Iver, Grizzly Bear, and Arcade Fire. Their contributions to In the Hollows sound wonderful, captured in warm, high definition in a proper Rhode Island studio. But this quintet ultimately feels flat and safe, rendering a picture that’s very pretty but remarkably similar to a pleasant watercolor you’d find hanging above the bed in a mid-prized hotel. If you were to read the liner notes for In the Hollows without actually listening to the record, you might assume that the music is fraught with worry, a document of extreme existential awareness given poignant shape. (Baldwin, after all, wrote the bulk of In the Hollows while training for his first marathon, a period that often pits the trainee against his or her own human frailty.) “Light a match to erase a lifetime leading here,” Baldwin offers during “Knockout”, a song that pits eternal perseverance against the fact that few things last very long at all. And on paper, “Cosmos Pose” is a sharp, short examination of the torture we endure to approach some arbitrary idea of perfection: “Sweat it out to make the weight/ Needles stuck in every vein.” But on tape, “Knockout” is practically buoyant, the grimace of the bowed bass and slapped drums lifting into a kind of hollow comfort. Cloying strings extend beneath Baldwin’s vocal, pulling tight like a safety net—which he clearly needs, since he sings the word “fucked” with the hesitation of a teenager cursing in front of parents for the first time. “Cosmos Pose” aims for high drama, with Hauser’s percussion responding to the foreboding call of the bass. Still, Baldwin seems to shrink from the weight of his own words, his voice tempered and tame even as the words he sings reveal crisis after crisis. Time and again, the arrangements and performances here seem to treat their subject matter like familial black sheep, shuddering at the anxieties they propose. “Half My Life” is borne of a nightmare and mid-life despair, but it’s as affable as a Disney score. “The End of the Night”, one of two solo numbers here, sets itself up as the record’s soul-baring centerpiece. But even as Baldwin sings “I don’t know if it’s weakness or strength/ Just know that I need something to go for,” his diction is overly precise and polished, as though he were reading through a written script at a wedding’s dress rehearsal. In the Hollows never feels lived-in, or more generously, part of the reality Baldwin has found and written into these songs. The exception comes with the title cut, the record’s biggest production and the most anomalous and audacious pop anthem of Baldwin’s career. Its words are, again, loaded with feelings—namely, the sense that all the enthusiasms and experiences we collect are simply sideshows during our own march to oblivion—as Baldwin lets his voice break only to pull it together, the strings tracking beneath him like a nervous heartbeat. “Even strides mark my path for the first and last time,” Baldwin sings, his tone a wonderful mess. In this moment of honest, human admission, he flashes above the quotidian company that this record keeps. It’s a riveting flash of inspiration—too brief to renew the album, yes, but good enough to reiterate that the upright bass-playing torch singer remains more than a mere sideman.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19324-nat-baldwin-in-the-hollows/,Western Vinyl,2014.0,"If there's one album that caught my attention recently for its sheer experimentalism, it's Nat Baldwin's ""In the Hollows."" With a rating of 5.7 out of 10, it's easy to start off by being a bit skeptical of what to expect, but once you immerse yourself into the album, you are greeted with an almost otherworldly experience.

For those who might not know Nat Baldwin, he is a multi-talented instrumentalist, bassist and composer who has worked with numerous bands, and is arguably one of the most underrated artists around today. His unique style is what sets him apart, from the experimental to the emotionally driven.

""In the Hollows"" stands out because it is a product of a collaboration between Baldwin and a number of musicians, including members of the bands Frog, Palm and Cloud Becomes Your Hand. This spontaneous approach to creating music has resulted in an album unlike any other, as it is woven with a variety of sounds and styles.

The album's making was an intensive process that spans years of recording and experimentation, and it shows. Each track feels carefully layered with an intricate mix of jazz, folk, and avant-garde vocals that are both challenging and beautiful.

One of the things that immediately caught my attention was the way the songs on the album perfectly complement each other. Being an experimental album, there are moments of dissonance and cacophony, but they are always juxtaposed with moments of harmony that are incredibly soothing, making the listening experience a journey worth taking.

Some of the standout tracks on the album include ""Weights,"" ""The Half,"" and ""Shimmer It Glimmer."" These tracks showcase Baldwin's emotional range through his lyrics, and his instrumental mastery through the range of sounds he conjures up in each song. The album also features a beautiful cover of ""The Fading"" by fellow experimental artist Grouper.

Overall, ""In the Hollows"" is not the type of album that you can put on in the background and ignore; it demands your attention and invites you into its universe, one that is unique, challenging, and beautiful. While not for everyone, if you are open-minded and eager to explore the unknown, this album is certainly worth a listen. It's a beautiful and bold example of experimental music that deserves more attention than it has received.","1.

A Certain Ratio,Change the Station,Electronic,6.0,August 1 2018,Daniel Martin-McCormick,Contributor,"“My heart was just an open sore/Which you picked at ’til it was raw/It bled away my existence/Shriveled under your insistence.” Who writes lyrics like these? Nihilist poets, emo singers, hyperliterate teenagers, sure—but a disco group? Dance music has often addressed themes of alienation, pain, and loss, but rarely has a band been both as enticingly funky and harrowingly bleak as Manchester’s A Certain Ratio. In their first decade, ACR made some of the most seminal yet underrated post-punk, avant-pop, and tweaked funk of an era filled with hybrid explorations. Early tracks like “Knife Slits Water” and “Do the Du” ruthlessly deconstructed the pleasures of the flesh while simultaneously urging listeners to succumb to them. Part of the fun remains in trying to decide if ACR were, at heart, party boys who couldn’t get out of their heads or overburdened cultural theorists looking for an escape hatch. As they moved into the 1980s, this binary juxtaposition would fall away in favor of a more expansive approach to dance music: brainy, jazzy, adventurous, yet keenly aware of exhilarating developments in the Top 40. The group had intimate ties to their hometown’s “Madchester” scene, a community of musicians and DJs clustered around Factory Records and its legendary nightclub, the Haçienda. Alongside fellow Mancunians New Order and the Happy Mondays as well as Leeds’ Gang of Four and Sheffield’s Cabaret Voltaire, ACR were a historic example of the spontaneous groupthink Brian Eno dubbed “scenius.” These artists exemplified the rushing development from punk’s snotty three-chord “fuck you”s into the nuanced, multifaceted expressions that defined underground music in the ’80s. By 1996, the dance music revolution that ACR & co. once anticipated had come to fruition beyond anyone’s expectations. House, techno, ambient, downtempo, jungle, drum ‘n’ bass, IDM, and their various subgenres (not to mention hip-hop) had exploded across the globe. During their late-1970s/early-’80s peak, ACR’s output was neck and neck with historic releases like Kraftwerk’s Computer World, the Upsetters’ Blackboard Jungle Vol. 1, and Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight.” But now the funky futurism of the ’80s sounded quaint compared to the blink-and-you-missed it developments in Berlin, London, Detroit, and New York. Change the Station was the band’s first effort in five years—an eternity for dance music at that time. In the meantime, artists as game-changing as Björk, Aphex Twin, Goldie, Underground Resistance, and Basic Channel had all brazenly recalibrated dance music’s DNA. It would be unfair to expect ACR to have kept up with the hectic pace of this next generation, but revisiting Change the Station today, it feels like the group was flagging. The album goes full Balearic, with lots of smooth downtempo breakbeats, soulful vocals, and unhurried saxophone. Soul II Soul’s 1989 smash “Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)” is a loose template, itself a commercial success story for the kind of multikulti, house-adjacent pop that ACR had been exploring 10 years prior. What Change the Station lacks is the sense of hyper-intelligent, nervy dissonance that brought depth to earlier albums. Even at their grooviest, ACR maintained an edge—the fun never came entirely free. The band who once asked “Who sold that knife to me?” here blandly implore you to “listen to the sound.” Ok, we’re listening. Now what? The sound of the album is in fact one of its central flaws. ACR’s songs often functioned more as energy fields than as clear narratives—sonic mobiles rather than roller-coaster rides. This practice was aided by tweaked timbres and attention to texture and effects. The production values on Change the Station are wholly professional, yet they lack strong personality. It feels like a mock-up for the record it should have been, its elements stock stand-ins for more riveting performances that never arrive. It’s unfortunate, because the core concept might have worked. The late 1990s were rife with jazzy, laid-back electronic music of all sorts, from A Tribe Called Quest to Massive Attack. But Change the Station’s session-musician sheen keeps these tracks at arm’s length. Play it in the background of your sushi restaurant all you want; it’s hard to imagine another scenario where it would thrive. After Change the Station, ACR retreated once again. It would be another 12 years before they regrouped to record 2008’s Mind Made Up in loose sessions guided by a spirit of openness. Compared with Change the Station, the later album embraces the band’s rock roots, shifting perspective from ecstasy-tinged inclusiveness to aloof, knowing narrations of modern ennui. The tasty RHCP-esque lick that opens “Way to Escape” suggests a slow-mo strut down the avenue, past junkies, businessmen, hustlers, crooks, and their victims. Mind Made Up feels rooted in a rotting metropolis, each expression of hope balanced by something dour. But this isn’t protest music—ACR are level-headed observers, thriving and surviving amid the chaos of modernity, smart enough to comment but powerless to change. “Just try stay funky/Just try to be cool,” sings Denise Johnson on “Rialto 2006,” nearly buried by waves of horns, guitar squall, and echo. Good advice. Overall, Mind Made Up is an improvement on its predecessor. The group allows itself to experiment and stretch out, and that alone gives the album a spark. It suffers from some of the dad-friendly blandness of Change the Station, particularly when the band attempts a driving groove, but their freewheeling energy is not without its charms. “Teri” is an awkward but affecting ballad built around a simple piano figure, while “Starlight” tries to manage a bit of the throwback disco that Hercules and Love Affair had recently reinvigorated. Both albums close with tracks that are notably stronger than anything on their respective LPs. Change the Station wraps with “Groove (E),” a beatless reprise of opener “Listen to the Sound.” By clearing out the arrangement, the song shifts gears from overeager to sensual. It’s not a masterpiece, but it has a smoky, penetrating vibe. Meanwhile, Mind Made Up finishes with the tumultuous “Very Busy Man.” Roiling and formless, it feels like a jam bashed out at the end of a long, frustrating day in the studio. Bass accents are cribbed from Miles Davis’ On the Corner, while the drums splinter into rolling waves of energy. Deep into their career, ACR’s strengths lay in the extreme ends of their personal spectrum: “Groove (E)” draws you in with a whisper while “Very Busy Man” lunges. One wonders the albums would have looked like if these last tracks had been the jumping-off point for a new direction. Neither Change the Station nor Mind Made Up could be expected to accomplish what their first records had done; few artists surf the zeitgeist so gracefully even once, and for most a second shot is unheard of. In these moments, though, it’s good to hear traces of that fevered energy—the razor’s edge of pleasure and pain that once made ACR one of the most vital bands of their time.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/a-certain-ratio-change-the-station-mind-made-up/,"Mute,Mute",1997.0,"Change the Station is the latest musical offering from the iconic Manchester band, A Certain Ratio. The band, which formed in 1977, has long been celebrated for their unique blend of post-punk, funk, and electronica, and the new album is no exception.

The album tells a story of change and evolution, something that has become the band's hallmark over the years. In fact, A Certain Ratio has never been afraid to challenge themselves or their listeners, and Change the Station is no different. The album is a bold and daring departure from their usual sound, incorporating more electronic elements than ever before.

What is particularly impressive about this album is the individuality of each song. Each track tells its own story, yet together they create a cohesive and dynamic whole. From the eerie synths of ""Friends Around Us"" to the frenzied beats of ""Yo Yo Gi,"" the album takes the listener on a journey through a sonic landscape that is simultaneously nostalgic and futuristic.

As a long-time fan of A Certain Ratio, I have to admit that Change the Station initially caught me off guard. However, after a few listens, I found myself completely entranced by the album's unique soundscapes and infectious grooves. Tracks like ""Berlin"" and ""Safari"" have a certain energy and intensity that is impossible to ignore, while slower, more contemplative tracks like ""Get a Grip"" and ""Taxi Guy"" showcase the band's more introspective side.

One thing that is particularly impressive about Change the Station is the band's attention to detail. The production is flawless, and every instrument and sound is given room to breathe. The mix strikes the perfect balance between precision and rawness, resulting in an album that is both polished and organic.

Overall, I would give A Certain Ratio's Change the Station a solid 6.0 out of 10.

The Fresh & Onlys,Secret Walls EP,Rock,7.5,April 22 2011,Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,"One of the Fresh & Onlys' most appealing traits is their sneaky sense of versatility; they subtly change styles with the effortlessness of putting their shoes on. And they've been tirelessly productive, too, writing more solid songs in the past three years than many bands have in an entire decade. One of my personal favorites is ""What's His Shadow Still Doing Here"", from the 2009 LP Grey-Eyed Girls. The song is a relatively laconic take on 1950s guitar pop-- but by no means a straight-line take. A stuttering backbeat stays just a little out of step with overlapping guitars, as frontman Tim Cohen turns a tried-and-true lover's protest-- get over that other guy!-- into a slightly freaked-out observation: ""If he disappeared into the clear/ Then tell me dear/ What's his shadow still doing here?"" On their latest EP, Secret Walls, the Fresh & Onlys further mine that sock-hopping sound, albeit with fewer alterations and a looser, more jammy approach. The production is cavernous, there are quite a few languid guitar solos, two cuts run over the four-minute mark (practically an eternity for these guys), and the closest thing to a bashed-out rave-up is the stormy closer, ""Poison Wine"", which sounds more like something you'd mope to than mosh out about. In a career that's been marked by slight left turns, the band has pulled its first true 180. It's a jarring change-up, and although they pull it off with remarkable ease, it might not appeal to those taken in by what Pitchfork's Marc Masters referred to as the ""non-stop hit parade"" of last year's excellent Play It Strange. As a career document, Secret Walls makes more sense when taking stock of Tim Cohen's solo outings. Last year's on-the-sly Laugh Tracks and this year's more expansive LP/EP set Magic Trick / Bad Blood contained a fair amount of ramshackle charm, but they also served as a window to the starker side of his songwriting. There's a similar pallor hanging over Secret Walls; the answer to the question asked in the expansive, hollow ""Do You Believe in Destiny?"" involves heading to an island ""where life will be so lonely,"" while ""Wash Over Us"" ends a relationship in the stroke of a single couplet: ""I wouldn't want to feel that we are something we are not/ We're puppets and our bodies are painted on."" The latter song is the strongest on Secret Walls, as its last two-thirds gently unspool into softly played keyboard, strung-out guitar lines, and the sound of Cohen's voice crooning and wailing in the distance. It's a neat trick, and it's one they've played before in briefer fashion on ""Arm's Advice"", the closer to the band's 2008 self-titled debut LP. The F&O's aren't even close to repeating themselves at this point-- hell, based on this release, they could change it up again entirely next time (and knowing these guys, that could be as soon as tomorrow). I wouldn't mind another 180 myself, but if they stay on this bummed-out course, I won't be mad.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15341-secret-walls-ep/,Sacred Bones,2011.0,"The Fresh & Onlys' 'Secret Walls EP' is a brooding, gritty rock offering that captures the essence of the genre in four succinct tracks. The five-piece San Franciscan band has been making waves for over a decade, and this EP serves as yet another solid addition to their vast discography.

There's something about the band's unique blend of garage rock and shoegaze that creates a sound that is both nostalgic and fresh. Their ability to effortlessly blend fuzzy guitar riffs with dreamy melodies is unmatched in today's music scene, and 'Secret Walls EP' is a testament to this.

The album opens with ""Wash Over Us,"" a slow-burning ballad that showcases the band's introspective side. The haunting vocals and ethereal guitar work transport the listener to a state of introspection, reflecting on life's overarching themes of love and loss.

Next up is ""Secret Walls,"" the titular track of the EP. This song immediately grabs the listener with its driving drumbeat and catchy guitar riffs. It's a classic rock track that is sure to get heads nodding and feet tapping. The anthemic chorus will have you singing along in no time.

""Agatha"" is the third track on the EP and arguably the standout song. The infectious bassline and twangy guitar riffs combine to create a groove that is impossible to resist. The chorus is catchy as hell, and the guitar solo towards the end is an absolute treat for the ears.

The EP closes with ""Invisible Forces,"" a dreamy track that slowly builds to an explosive climax. The song features some of the band's best lyrics, and it's the perfect ending to an exceptional EP.

Overall, 'Secret Walls EP' is a great addition to The Fresh & Onlys' back catalog. It encapsulates the band's ability to make timeless music that showcases their unique approach to the rock genre. The EP is a solid 7.5 out of 10 - definitely worth a listen, no matter what type of rock you're into.","1. Both reviews discuss the same EP by The Fresh & Onlys.

Atmosphere,The Family Sign,Rap,5.8,April 13 2011,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Lots of indie-rap figures wallow in self-pity, bemoan their own bad habits, snap at those who make life hard for them, and somehow find a way to wrap all those emotions up into a resilient shell. But Atmopshere's Slug established a particular knack for it when he broke outside the Twin Cities about a decade back-- every heartfelt line about lonely people or fractured relations was offset by an offhand remark that took some the sting out of his lamentations. Atmosphere got tagged as ""emo rap"" because there wasn't an easier go-to term for a barfly raconteur with female troubles, but while Slug's lyrics spoke to the same sour impulses that drove teenage misery, they did so through the experiences of someone who discovers to that misery when you grow up. The catch is that growing up also means growing out of a few things, and The Family Sign catches Slug at a point where he seems to be tilting more towards plainspoken sincerity. The hard-drinking, love-stressed, party-fatigued persona that made him a breakout cult figure 10 years ago might sound somewhere between disingenuous and ridiculous coming from a 38-year-old today. But in stripping some of the more larger-than-life traits of misspent youth away from his approach, he's also lost some of the outsized arrogance and aw-shucks smartassedness that gave his more po-faced moments a three-dimensional context or sharp emotional counterpoint. While The Family Sign has a specific titular focus on loved (and formerly loved) ones and the way people define themselves through them, the real conceptual leap on this album is how patriarch maturity means less jokiness, more earnestness, and a traveled perspective that doesn't leave much room for not giving a fuck. What room is left winds up parceled out over a couple of highlights. As blunt as the premise is, the negligent alky father meets stoner pickpockets of ""Bad Bad Daddy"" has a certain caustic bite to it. And the road-ravaged, detail-rich narrative of ""Millennium Dodo"" evokes the same harebrained excitement-slash-disorientation that made the best moments of 2003's fantastic Seven's Travels stand out. Pointing out his car's mirror-ball décor as an homage to Escape From New York or noting the resemblance between a Best Western clerk and ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" nebbish Les Nessman is the sort of pop-culture debris that's evocative enough to transcend reference-dropping and hint at the metaphorical reserves in Slug's brain. But the track also starts out with a couplet-- ""I only act like an asshole/ Why don't ch'y'all stand back, let the man grow""-- that explains the rest of the album's almost total lack of sardonic edge. Heartfelt moments haven't necessarily been beyond Slug's grasp-- When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold highlight ""Wild Wild Horses"" and ""Lifter Puller"" off Seven's Travels are genuinely moving in a way that few indie-rap love songs are. But here love songs are deployed a bit blank-facedly, strings of clichés, shrugging platitudes and half-thoughts drawn together into a husk of what used to be a compellingly contradictory personality. The idea of a banal yet subtly tense reunion with a long-forgotten ex in ""Your Name Here"" is undercut by the fact that there's not enough interesting personal details to make Slug's rejected reconnection come across like anything more than a petty dismissal. And while ""The Last to Say"" is 100% worth hearing if it convinces just one woman to leave the abusive asshole that blackens her eyes, it's weird that it sounds less emotionally invested than the sharp-spitting breakup kissoff ""Just for Show"". As Slug's performative role dials down the emotional resonance, the beats have followed suit into a low-intensity churn, one that undercuts what could've been a set of adventurous live-band hip-hop with a uniform lethargy that tops out at mid-tempo. While the instrumentation of When Life Gives You Lemons signaled a wealth of potential new directions for Atmosphere's production, The Family Sign runs almost entirely on gloomy ballads heavy on maudlin piano chords and keening guitar riffs. That latter instrument's maybe the most interesting sonic component of Ant's post-sampling compositional phase, and Nate Collis cranks out Black Keys-ian twang (""Bad Bad Daddy""), psychedelic noir (""My Key""), and eerie slide (""The Last to Say"") with versatile ease. And if Erick Anderson's keyboards tend to provide more texture than melody, at least he's as handy with Jackie Mittoo reggae riffs (""Just for Show"") as he is with new wave glow (""I Don't Need Brighter Days""). But there's little to cut through the fog-- with the exception of the joy-buzzer jolt of ""She's Enough"" and the flailing attempt at Nilsson-style AM pop on ""Ain't Nobody"", this is music that conflates maturity with exhaustion.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15297-the-family-sign/,Rhymesayers,2011.0,"Greetings fellow music enthusiasts! Today, I'm excited to share my thoughts on the highly debated and divisive album, 'The Family Sign' by Atmosphere. This album, which falls within the rap genre, has received a polarizing rating of 5.8 out of 10, which sparked my curiosity to explore it in-depth.

Before I dive into my review, let me take a moment to discuss the origins of the group and the story behind this album. Atmosphere is a hip-hop duo hailing from the Midwest, consisting of rapper Slug and producer Ant. They've been putting out music since the late '90s and have gained a devoted fanbase for their introspective lyrics and atmospheric beats.

'The Family Sign' was released in 2011, following a four-year drought of new music from the duo. The album was created during a challenging time for the group, marked by personal struggles and a desire to push their creative limits. According to Slug, the album was an attempt to explore what it means to be part of a family and the complicated dynamics that arise within it.

Now, let's get to the music itself. With its moody melodies and introspective lyrics, it's no surprise that 'The Family Sign' is a departure from the more upbeat and energetic sound of Atmosphere's previous albums. Instead, we are presented with a collection of contemplative tracks that explore themes of love, loss, and self-exploration.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""The Last to Say,"" which tackles the difficult topic of domestic abuse. Slug's raw and emotional delivery is perfectly complemented by the haunting piano melody, creating a powerful and moving listening experience.

Another standout track is ""Became,"" which explores the complexities of personal growth and change. The song's repetitive chorus, ""I used to be a skeptic, but now I'm better,"" serves as a powerful reminder that growth is an ongoing process, and that we are all capable of change.

As for my personal experience with 'The Family Sign,' I must admit that it took me a few listens to truly appreciate this album. While it may not be as immediately catchy or energetic as some of Atmosphere's previous work, it is a deeply introspective and thought-provoking collection that rewards repeated listens.

In conclusion, while 'The Family Sign' may not be for everyone, it is an album that deserves attention and appreciation for its unconventional approach to the rap genre and the raw emotion and vulnerability it showcases. I give it a solid 8 out of 10 and highly recommend checking it out!","1. Review A is longer and more detailed than Review B, with specific examples of tracks and lyrics from the album.

Mount Eerie,Ocean Roar,Rock,8.1,September 6 2012,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"Ocean Roar is the second of a pair of albums Phil Elverum recorded recently on extended break from tour. Holed up in a de-sanctified church in the town of Anacortes, Wash., he began making music of heightened attention-- to surroundings, to his consciousness, to nature. The albums are full of the kind of observations you find time to make only when you haven't talked to anyone for a few weeks. May's Clear Moon was a dreamy fantasia about home, its comforts, and also the trickle of anxiety you feel when you are reminded of its fragility. The midnight-black Ocean Roar, meanwhile, is an experiment in imagined homelessness: It has a facing-the-beast quality of a punishing spiritual quest, as if Elverum steeled himself and left his house at midnight, barefoot, and just kept walking. Clear Moon opened with the faint sigh of a single acoustic guitar-- a tree branch scraping your bedroom window, maybe-- but Ocean Roar's ""Pale Lights"" opens on a storm, an an ominous churn of organ and drums signaling the imminent arrival of bad feelings. As he always does, Elverum shapes sounds so that they arrive in tantalizing pulses: When he sings, ""a small yelp on the wind/ And then, more roaring,"" over the murk of the music, which has suddenly died down, you are squinting through the album's black-night sound to discern moving shapes just as he is. This odd sensation, of straining to hear music piping through buds wedged directly into your ears, is a good sign that you're in Elverum's world; it gives his music a fragile air, like something that might not survive without your intervention. Elverum's voice sounds more frail than ever here, flanked by bleak, oppressive towers of electric guitar. He's talked about the influence of black metal on his music before, and it has surfaced sonically on Wind's Poem and elsewhere, but Ocean Roar is the first place you can feel it: The spine-scraping, all-sixteenths tremolo'd guitars of the Popol Vuh cover ""Engel Der Luft"" channel the tinny evil of early black-metal recordings; ""Waves"" pounds mercilessly with drum rolls and a nastily distorted bass guitar for nearly its entire running time, with Elverum surfacing only for a moment to mumble the album's title and disappear beneath the noise. He casts himself as a small force lost in the wake of something huge, and seems mostly interested in black metal for its elemental dread. In the middle of all this gnarled, frozen-gray bleakness, the gentler moments gleam like snow-globe hallucinations. ""I Walked Home Beholding"" is the charmed center of the record, the moment when the noise clears and Elverum surveys, with his signature quiet awe, the power of nature to bury his small town. It is the kind of redemptive, reassuring note that many might choose to close on; everything's all right, kids, here comes the moon. Or, in Elverum-speak: ""Totally at peace with the meaninglessness of living."" But the final track, immediately following ""I Walked Home"", is a seven-minute, tar-thick pulse of droning guitars (one of two slightly overlong instrumentals on this quite short record) that threaten to blot out everything else before them, before cutting off, sharp, hot, and sputtering, trailing abruptly into an unsettled silence. What Elverum wants to convey with this rude closing is unclear, but one thing is certain: The storm, metaphorical or otherwise, has closed back in behind him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16988-ocean-roar/,P.W. Elverum & Sun,2012.0,"If you're a fan of modern rock, Mount Eerie's ""Ocean Roar"" is an album that you don't want to miss. With a rating of 8.1 out of 10, it's no wonder that ""Ocean Roar"" has garnered such attention in the music industry. In this review, we'll take a closer look at the band's history, the album's creative process, my own personal experience, and some standout tracks that make this album a must-listen.

Before we dive into the album, let's take a brief look at the band. Mount Eerie is an experimental rock band from Anacortes, Washington, founded by Phil Elverum in 2003. The band has been active for well over a decade and during that time, they have released a plethora of high-quality albums. The band's music has always been praised for its creativity, versatility, and originality. ""Ocean Roar"" is no exception to this.

Now let's talk about ""Ocean Roar"" specifically. The story of its creation is an intriguing one. It was said that Phil Elverum wrote the songs during the winter season on his own in a remote cabin without electricity or running water in Anacortes, Washington state. As he penned the tracks, the sound of waves crashing through the winter storms occasionally interrupted his thoughts. These sounds eventually became an inspiration for the album.

The album itself is a journey through the unique sounds created by Mount Eerie. Opening with the track ""Pale Lights"", the listener is immediately immersed in a world of tantalizing guitar riffs and haunting vocals. As the album progresses, the listener is taken through a range of emotions from peaceful serenity in ""Ocean Roar"" to heart-hammering chaos in ""Engel Der Gegenwart"".

While I appreciated the variety of the album, I have to admit that not every track was my favourite. For instance, ""Waves"" fell a bit flat for me personally; however, the overwhelmingly positive reception of this track among other fans proves that my opinion isn't the end-all-be-all. However, the standout track for me was undoubtedly ""I Walked Home Beholding"", which seems to encapsulate everything that Mount Eerie does best – intriguing sounds, haunting lyrics and ethereal melodies.

Overall, I would say that ""Ocean Roar"" is an album that any fan of modern rock simply must hear. Its unique blend of sounds, poetic lyrics, and the band's commitment to creating something new and original make it stand out in a crowded sea of music. I would rate this album an 8.1 out of 10, and that's only because one or two tracks fell a little flat for me. For the most part, this album is a work of art that flawlessly executes the band's creative vision.","1.

For Stars,Airline People EP,Rock,4.9,January 1 2000,Ryan Kearney,,"There are only two kinds of music fans: those who focus on lyrics, and those who focus on sound. The former are willing to accept sub-par instrumentation for the sake of strong lyricism, while the latter are willing to ignore poor lyrics, so long as they're accompanied by strong instrumentation. From The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan to Kid A, this has been a major source of division in the music world. This, of course, is one of music criticism's worst myths, perpetuated no doubt by fans of Maya Angelou. But let's pretend, for the sake of this review, that the myth is true. Then For Stars are for all you ""sound"" people. During the opener, ""At the End of the World,"" you'll notice an innocent acoustic guitar, tentative percussion that includes a maraca, and a subtle glockenspiel. It's all very nice-- too consciously nice, in fact. But then frontman Carlos Forster and a set of more feminine pipes join together for the opening lines: ""At the end of the world/ I am yours, you are mine/ When the walls come caving in/ I am yours, you are mine."" ""Lyrics"" people worldwide are using Dylan for cotton balls, while ""sound"" people are rocking back and forth in feigned ignorance. The rest of this five-song EP-- a collection of outtakes from the band's first two U.S. albums-- is more of the same: a quaint indie-folk band stuck in Frisco circa Scott McKenzie's suggestion to hippie pilgrims that they ""be sure to wear some flowers in [their] hair."" If I were a ""sound"" person, I'd invoke rainy days or summer's twilight. I might even use words like ""bittersweet"" and ""heartfelt."" But I must be a ""lyrics"" person, because I can't help but point out the revelatory chorus of the next track, ""Brown Skin Saint"": ""We have dreams, they make us laugh/ We have guns, they make us cry/ We have cars, we'll get there fast/ We have airplanes, for the sky."" And sung in a whiny falsetto, even! The one true bright spot on Airline People is ""The Racecar Driving Scene,"" where the Belle and Sebastian influence is, as opposed to the other tracks, more palpable in the lyrics than the music. ""I got involved with the racecar driving scene/ We'd act like heroes, and smell like gasoline,"" sings Forster, the more subdued vocal route serving him well. Over the course of 4\xBD minutes, the song builds into a crescendo of distorted guitars and roused drums that signals an awakening-- literally-- of band and listener alike. But even this song raises the question: why does it takes five guys to make music this sparse and simple? No one may ever know why, but here's a question you should be able to answer: are you a ""lyrics"" person or a ""sound"" person? Don't know? Here's how you can tell: if you've found the horrible pun in their name, then you're the former; if you haven't, then maybe For Stars are four you.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3152-airline-people-ep/,"Acuarela,Acuarela",,"For Stars' EP, Airline People, is an intriguing rock offering which, despite its rating of 4.9 out of 10, managed to catch my attention and keep me hooked. Let me share my thoughts on this record.

For those unfamiliar with the band, For Stars have been around since the mid-90s and have been creating distinct and genre-bending music ever since. The band's lineup has undergone changes over the years, but the core members include Carlos Forster (vocals, guitar), Brian Aguilar (bass), and Norm Block (drums). Airline People was released in 2002 and consists of six tracks. The album was produced by John Croslin, who has worked with some of the biggest names in indie rock music.

The album's creation story is a result of the band's extensive touring schedule, which had them traveling all over the USA and Europe. This experience provided them with the chance to meet people from all walks of life, and this diverse mix of passengers inspired the songs on the record. Each track depicts a different story or emotion based on the experiences they had while traveling. For example, the track ""I'm in Love With a Girl Who's Already in Love With a Boy"" tells a tale of unrequited love while ""Portugal"" is a song about escaping reality and exploring new places.

Personally, while not all the songs on the album are instant hits, the EP offers a unique and captivating rock experience. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys deep lyrical content and music that tells a story. The production is top-notch, and the band's expertise is evident in the intricacies of each song. While the band's rating of 4.9 out of 10 may deter some listeners, I believe this is a hidden gem that should not be overlooked.

In conclusion, For Stars' Airline People EP is a highly underrated record that offers an emotional and thought-provoking rock experience. Despite the low rating, the album is a testament to the band's ability to create intricate and moving music. I highly recommend this album to anyone looking for a fresh take on the rock genre.","1.

Jóhann Jóhannsson,Dís,Experimental,7.5,September 21 2005,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Composers are artists, but the word is also a job description. When Jóhann Jóhannsson of Iceland was commissioned to write the score for the 2004 film Dís, which he says, ""Captures quite well the zeitgeist of early 21st century Reykjavik,"" he sat down to create music to complement the images. He collaborated with members of various Icelandic bands including guitarist Hilmar Jensson and singer Ragheidur Gröndal but never bothered to ring his friends in the orchestra. Hearing this soundtrack I can't help thinking of Ennio Morricone, another composer who-- though he has a distinct style-- is willing to let his music proceed along functional lines. On almost every level Dís is completely different from Jóhannsson's last two records for Touch. Eschewing strings, horns, and cloud-drift pacing, Jóhannsson opts for a mixture of unassuming and bubbly electronic pop and delicate piano-based instrumentals. I said this record differs from Jóhannsson's work on almost every level, and the areas of overlap tell us a lot about his values as a composer. The common threads are Jóhannsson's airy use of space and the fundamental simplicity with which he approaches melody and arrangement. The repeating themes and motifs-- picking them out is always an enjoyable part of soundtrack listening-- are little tunes that would be easy to play with a couple fingers on a keyboard. Jóhannsson never uses five notes for a melody when four will do, and he's perfectly happy to let a piano with a wisp of processing do all the work when necessary. Some of this is up the job he was asked to do. Film music need only pose questions and it's up to the images to provide answers. While this can sometimes lead to soundtrack albums that seem incomplete, Jóhannsson's comfort with minimalism means Dís works quite well as a standalone album. Though capturing the 21st century zeitgeist was a stated goal, we're living in a retro age and Dís has unmistakable echoes of the past. Certain glitchy techniques seem an electronic development of the last five or six years, but the bulk of the record reflects sounds and attitudes from an earlier time. Wispy instrumentals like ""Efripides Og Nedripides"" and ""Thynnkudagur"" are particularly evocative of early synthesizer music like Cluster or Kraftwerk circa Ralf & Florian. Electronics then were still a novelty and using the machines to play a lovely well-constructed melody, maybe with a bit of piano thrown in, was comforting, a word easily applied to Jóhannsson's charming cues. The handful of upbeat pop numbers, on the other hand, have one string tied to the 80s. The guitar-led instrumental ""10 Rokkstig"" is like a slightly toned-down version of what Giorgio Moroder contributed to the Top Gun soundtrack, while the title track, sung by Gröndal, reminds me a bit of the Sundays. These refracted images of the past fit together to form the album's current of hazy nostalgia touched with a sense of yearning. As effective as it is, Dís can be almost too subtle for its own good, too willing to slip into the background where it will always sound appropriate. Perhaps that's the danger of functional music, though, which doesn't take away from how enjoyable a record this can be given proper focus. It's a taut and efficient collection that, while a departure from Jóhannsson's earlier work, is in its own way just as satisfying.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4276-dis/,"12 Tónar,12 Tónar",2004.0,"Hey guys, today we're going to talk about ""Dís,"" the experimental album by Jóhann Jóhannsson. It's received a rating of 7.5 out of 10, but let's dive deeper into what makes this album so unique.

First things first, let's unpack some background information on the artist himself. Jóhann Jóhannsson, a renowned Icelandic composer, has been a pioneer in the industry for several years. His discography ranges from the experimental techno of ""IBM 1401, A User's Manual"" to his melancholic and heart-wrenching soundtrack contributions on films like ""The Theory of Everything"" and ""Sicario."" He's truly a chameleon in his ability to cohesively blend a wide array of genres.

So what makes ""Dís"" stand out from his previous works? The album was recorded in his own studio in Berlin with an ensemble of musicians. The production process is a credit to why it sounds so raw and organic. It's fascinating to hear how the sounds are layered and how they complement each other. The opening track ""K"" starts with ambient sounds that gradually transform into a tidal wave of emotive strings, which hit me in the soul.

This album is unique in that it blurs the lines between various different genres. In ""Dis,"" some tracks are experimental, others are classical, and some even have jazz influences scattered throughout. It's a collection of sounds that shouldn't necessarily work together, but they do. This in itself showcases the experimental and innovative flair of Jóhannsson. The audio landscape he's created is difficult to define, but it is definitively experimental.

Personally, I found ""Dis"" to be a highly immersive experience. It's not an album that you casually listen to for background music on a long drive or while doing work. It demands your attention and beckons you into its world. Each track is layered with meaning, and at times, it feels like an introspective journey. Standout tracks like ""J,"" ""O,"" and ""N"" leave me feeling somewhat introspective and contemplative.

In conclusion, I highly recommend giving this album a listen to anyone looking to delve into the inner workings of experimental music. Jóhann Jóhannsson manages to combine various genres into a cohesive and thought-provoking project. ""Dis"" is an immersive journey that leaves a unique impression on the listener.","1.

GAS,Rausch,Electronic,7.8,May 18 2018,Daniel Martin-McCormick,Contributor,"“They dreamed of a fusion of worlds,” wrote the historian Modris Eksteins in his landmark Rites of Spring, describing Germany on the eve of the first World War: “The technical became spiritual.” Following a rapid economic expansion from a loose network of rustic provinces to a united industrial superpower, the nation embraced a fresh mythology. “Efficiency became an end, not a means. And Germany herself became the expression of an elemental ‘life force.’” In many ways, this description applies just as readily to the music of Kompakt co-founder Wolfgang Voigt’s GAS alias. By using computers to meticulously process samples of Wagner, Volksmusik, and Schlager into pulsating atmospheres, Voigt refracts German identity through a haunting digital prism. Albums like 1998’s Königsforst and 2000’s Pop are collections of moments drawn out for five, 10, or 15 minutes. The tracks barely evolve; the music feels like a slowly unfolding natural phenomenon, born from a collision of the acoustic and digital. Evoking his youthful LSD trips in the Black Forest, the tingling high frequencies call to mind buzzing insects or rippling water, while slow-motion chords envelop like the womb. The GAS alias went silent following the release of Nah Und Fern, a retrospective 2008 box set cementing the project’s legacy. But last year, Voigt reappeared with Narkopop, which was a bumpy landing for fans: Listeners expecting a second helping of the project’s iconic, mesmerizing tones were instead met with fidgety disruptions. Returning now with Rausch, GAS remains in an unsettled headspace. In 1999, Voigt described the project warmly: “The aim is always to give love and to be loved for your work.” It’s hard to draw that conclusion today. Rausch heaves with a potent cocktail of seasick unease, grand visions, and snarling intensity. As far-right nationalist political views lurch back into Germany’s mainstream, the project’s motherland obsessions seem suddenly less comfortable in their own skin, exuding a dissonant terror alongside the requisite transcendence. Rausch is meant to be taken in as a single, hour-long piece made up of seven parts. It’s an imposing listen. More than anything, this album looms over you, swaying back and forth between awesomeness and menace. The title translates to an ecstatic state of drunkenness, or “frenzy,” and the most joyful passages teeter on the edge of chaos and oblivion. The opening contains some of the most beautiful music on the record: nearly eight minutes of stretched-out symphonic tones, rain-like static, and depth-charge bass. The arrangement is stacked to emphasize the sense of scale: The low end invites vertigo, while cymbals guide your gaze upwards, letting you breathe in pure, brisk air. In the middle, dense harmonies cascade with the muted majesty of cloud banks. Voigt has left the Black Forest for an alpine summit. If Voigt were to fade it out here, “Rausch 1” would stand as another gorgeous addition to the GAS catalogue. Instead, it’s a prelude to a descent accompanied by a chugging beer-hall beat. A bleary unease sets in, the threat of violence looming in the otherwise ethereal mist. Dissonance ripples across the surface, at times deep in the background, elsewhere rudely elbowing its way to the front. By the time we get to “Rausch 4,” the mix is half consumed by a wind-tunnel roar. Over three cycles, this rhythm rises up to the surface amid alternating waves of confusion and splendor, only to recede again. It’s another take on the timelessness that distinguished the GAS albums of the early 1990s. If those records suggested a kind of meditative eternity, Rausch feels like the mess of history playing out in an intoxicated melee. GAS’ rebirth could have easily coasted on almost two decades of accumulated goodwill, ignoring the knotty and uncomfortable problems of the day in favor of a detached, expertly crafted rehash. No one would complain, or perhaps even notice. Instead, Voigt continues to absorb and explore. Rausch, though hardly topical, feels current, as jarring and revealing as last night’s nightmare.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gas-rausch/,Kompakt,2018.0,"If you're looking for an electronic album that'll take you on a journey through a dreamlike soundscape, GAS's ""Rausch"" is just the album for you. The German producer, Wolfgang Voigt, known for having co-founded the influential German techno label Kompakt, has outdone himself with this release.

Voigt began the GAS project in the mid-1990s that was initially a music experiment that centered around exploring the differences between traditional techno and abstract soundscapes. Now, over two decades later, he has released ""Rausch,"" an album that sits comfortably amidst his earlier works, yet also feels fresh and innovative at the same time.

One thing that stands out about ""Rausch"" is the artful use of repetition to create a hypnotic, trance-inducing effect. The opening track, ""Rausch 01,"" runs for 14 minutes and sets the tone for the album. The gentle hum of a synth filled with reverb and echo creates a sound that's both calm and chaotic—the kind of sound that'll make you appreciate the album even more when using a good pair of headphones. 

The second track, ""Rausch 02,"" is where the album reaches full speed. The intense, fast-paced breakbeats, combined with out-of-phase low sub-bass, create an awe-inspiring trance-like experience. The song climaxes with a bass drop that never disappoints. It's an absolute masterpiece of a track that'll make your mind and body move to its rhythms.

The album continues with tracks like ""Rausch 03,"" ""Rausch 04,"" and ""Rausch 05,"" each lasting over 10 minutes. One may expect the tracks to feel monotonous at this point, but GAS manages to keep things dynamic by introducing new elements such as panning hi-hats or changing synth patterns. 

Despite the album's complexity, there's an inherent accessibility to it. It's an album that'll appeal to both long-time electronic music fans and newcomers to the genre. The sound doesn't rely on pounding bass or ear-piercing hi-hats, but rather on a sophisticated use of sonic textures and layers.

Overall, the ""Rausch"" album by GAS is a must-listen. The album is an absolute joy to listen to, and it's evident that GAS dedicated significant time to every detail. The artful use of repetition, the hypnotic synth-work, and the intricate atmospheric sounds— all contribute to the album's mysterious and complex nature.

Overall, I would rate this album an impressive 7.8 out of 10. I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates electronic music that's challenging yet accessible, and that takes the listener on a journey through a hypnotic sonic landscape.","1.

Molly Nilsson,History,Pop/R&B,7.0,April 17 2012,Emilie Friedlander,Contributor,"Last year, John Maus' We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves LP included a song by a little-known, Swedish-born synth-pop artist named Molly Nilsson. ""Hey Moon"" was a lovely, downtempo duet, offsetting the claustrophobic intensity of Maus' originals with a moment of understatement and calm. What many of us didn't realize was that, aside from Maus' vocals, it was an almost note-perfect rendition of a track from These Things Take Time, a CD-R Nilsson self-released in 2008. Since then the interview-shy, Berlin-based songwriter has written and home-recorded no fewer than three LPs, and put all of them out on her own Dark Skies Association imprint. Like Maus', her songs are built primarily from vocals and vintage electronics, with a comforting patina of false age. History, her fourth full-length, is an 11-track collection of power ballads and off-kilter dance-pop, carried by the commanding, almost Nico-like ominousness of her voice. Synthetic, darkly romantic, and full of grandiose swells, her songs are likely to sound self-consciously 1980s without reminding you of any artist in particular. They also feel slightly awkward, as though she were struggling to reproduce the ecstatic pop vision inside her head using the antiquated tools at her disposal. Should there be any doubt that Nilsson's notion of History is partly about the relationship between humans and technology, anthemic opener ""In Real Life"" cuts straight to the chase with an existential meditation on the unreality of life in the internet age: ""Online I never feel alone. I never feel alive."" ""Hotel Home"", another anthemic standout, sees Nilsson comparing herself to a ""satellite,"" and warning us that she's ""never at home, so call on Skype."" There is a sort of wide-eyed innocence to statements like these, a guilelessness that feels equivalent to the cheesy synth presets she unleashes from the opening note. Susan Sontag once defined camp as ""art that proposes itself seriously, but cannot be taken altogether seriously because it is 'too much.'"" Album standout ""I Hope You Die"" demonstrates the over-the-topness of Nilsson's aesthetic most forcefully, combining a bouncy dance beat, swirling synths, and the sort of tragic romanticism that would make Morrissey proud: ""I hope you die, by my side, the two of us at the exact same time."" The key here is that Nilsson's music feels celebratory even at its darkest moments, chock full of auto-harmonies and dramatic tempo changes and eager remind us that ""too much"" can be very satisfying sometimes. For the most part, History unfolds with the theatrical pacing of a rock opera, alternating between large-sounding anthems and more stripped-down, slow-paced asides, usually with Nilsson singing over elementary piano melodies. Even with these variations, everything does start to feel a little bit the same, but you probably won't mind if you're easily enchanted by the album's overall gloss of elegiac, glam-rock decadence, enhanced by Nilsson's deadpan delivery, and lyrics that revolve around doomed love, lost worlds (see: ""The City of Atlantis""), and ""chances... blown"" (""Hotel Home""). Even if you're not, there's still something charming about the sound of a person trying to make ""big"" music with wonky drum machines and limited keyboard technique. When she doesn't quite pull it off, there's a beauty to the sound of a person trying, failing, and letting us bear witness to the whole thing. When she does, we're smitten.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16510-molly-nilsson-history/,Dark Skies Association,2012.0,"Molly Nilsson's 2011 album ""History"" is a true gem of the pop/R&B genre, garnering a rating of 7.0 out of 10. It's easy for an album in this genre to fall into the trap of being predictable and formulaic, but Nilsson has managed to infuse her own unique style and sound into this record, making it stand out from the rest.

Before diving into the details of the album, it's worth mentioning a bit about the band's history. Molly Nilsson is a Swedish singer/songwriter based in Berlin, Germany. She's been active in the underground music scene since the mid-2000s, releasing a number of records through her own label, Dark Skies Association. Her music has gained a cult following, and it's easy to see why. Her intimate and personal lyrics, combined with her pop sensibilities and electronic soundscapes, create a sound that's both familiar and fresh.

""History"" is a culmination of Nilsson's work up until that point. It's her fourth album, and it was recorded in Berlin in just two weeks. What's most impressive about this record is that Nilsson played and recorded everything herself, creating a fully realized and cohesive album that stands up to repeated listens.

The album starts off with ""In Real Life,"" a pulsing synth-pop track that sets the tone for the rest of the record. The lyrics deal with the conflict between the digital world and the real world, a recurring theme throughout the album. ""Hotel Home"" is a standout track, with a simple and catchy melody and lyrics that paint a picture of loneliness and isolation. ""Keep the Change"" is another highlight, with a driving beat and a chorus that's impossible not to sing along to.

Throughout the album, Nilsson's voice is front and center, and it's a thing of beauty. Her voice is gentle and dreamlike, but with an undeniable presence that demands your attention. She's not afraid to experiment with different vocal effects, either. ""Wounds Itch When They Heal"" is a prime example, with her voice distorted and layered over a swirling synthesizer.

All in all, ""History"" is a fantastic album that showcases Molly Nilsson's talent as a songwriter and producer. The album's themes of isolation, technology, and personal history make it a deeply personal listening experience. If you're a fan of pop/R&B with a bit of an edge, then this album is definitely worth your time. Just be warned: you might find yourself singing along to every track.","1.

Kelley Stoltz,Circular Sounds,Rock,6.7,February 18 2008,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Not that anyone's really asking, but the distinction between ""music blogger"" and ""music critic"" seems to fall along the lines of ""Kelley Stoltz."" Circular Sounds is proof of why he's wildly popular amongst the former, since it's a treasure trove for people who divorce mp3s from entire albums. The record seems mindfully considered with proper (if not particularly hip) sonic touchstones in mind, and it's easy to imagine Kelley Stoltz laying down the clip-clop percussion to the loping ballad ""Gardenia"" with a mile-wide grin after his thousandth listen of Pet Sounds. Whether politely rocking out or spinning something pastoral, Circular Sounds manages to come across as casual without seeming tossed-off. If could all sound good on the radio, even if you know that particular station exists in an alternate universe and probably switched over to reggaeton in 2006. You have to wonder why Stoltz insists on the innocuously self-centered act of putting his own name on his records when he's spent so much of his time trying to be someone else, whether it's Jeff Buckley (answering fan mail as one of his interns), Ian McCulloch (covering Crocodiles in its entirety), or a cavalcade of 60s icons (his last LP, Below the Branches). Even the tracks that can remotely be considered contemporary still conjure bands steeped in canon, as in the figure 8s of Elliott Smith guitar work (""Tintinnabulation"") or Spoon's brassy r(y)hthm and soul on the grating character study ""The Birmingham Eccentric"". Stoltz jokingly described the step up in production on Circular Sounds as ""mid-fi,"" about right for someone who sounds like his home studio is overrun with every instrument he's ever come across except a computer. ""Everything Begins"" scampers about with woozy horns and piano, as welcoming as it is disorienting. More than last time, the album's got enough meat and gristle during the midsection to avoid the thing being swallowed whole. The pre-disco string hits of ""Your Reverie"" are his canniest production trick yet and ""When You Forget"" supplements its vocal melodies with ringing guitar lines that avoid becoming flavorless. Yet the sum of Circular Sounds can feel impersonal, especially in how Stoltz hopscotches from voice to voice, some far stronger than others-- he doesn't have near the range to pull off the high notes on the village green waltz of ""Mother Nature"". ""Put My Troubles To Sleep"", a ""what if?"" proposition of Damon Albarn covering Graham Coxon, finds Stoltz trying to cope with an empty bed with everything from tequila to counting sheep. But its impact is dulled by a fussy music hall chord progression that makes everything feel preordained instead of inspired. Even the catchiest numbers derive their impact more from earworm repetition than any sort of pristine melodic architecture. ""To Speak to the Girl"" will wind around your brain in the same manner it's composed, as in a continuous, nagging loop of the title. Waffling on Stoltz begs the question, ""What would happen if he decides to scuff his treasured record collection with some of his own grooves?"" 2007 was a great year for guys who channeled the 60s into a personal vision, but Caribou and Panda Bear did it from the mindframe of electronic music, whereas Stoltz is strictly a singer-songwriter. Desiring a Kelley Stoltz record with no outside artistic guidance is to wish for something that probably doesn't exist, so once again Circular Sounds renders Stoltz a non-entity, subject to your expectations alone.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11137-circular-sounds/,Sub Pop,2008.0,"If you're a fan of rock music and looking for something fresh, new, and surprising, Kelley Stoltz's latest album, ""Circular Sounds,"" is the place to be. With a perfect blend of avant-garde and traditional rock elements, Stoltz takes you on a journey full of twists and turns, leaving you in a state of musical bliss.

Kelley Stoltz is a seasoned musician who's been around for quite some time. He's played with several bands in the past, keeping the indie rock scene alive and well. ""Circular Sounds"" is his sixth studio album, and it's clear that he's only gotten better with time. The album is recorded on an old 16-track tape machine, which gives it a unique sound that feels vintage and authentic.

The album's creation story is as interesting as the music itself. Stoltz recorded the album in his basement, playing every instrument himself, which adds to the personal and authentic feel of the album. The recording process took six months, and it's clear that Stoltz put a lot of effort and time into perfecting every element of the album.

When listening to ""Circular Sounds,"" I was struck by how every track tells a different story. From the introspective and dreamy ""Memory Collector"" to the upbeat and playful ""Pinecone,"" the album manages to create a balance between light and dark tones, which is no small feat in the world of rock music.

Stoltz's unique approach to music is evident in every track, but I couldn't help but feel that the album's pacing was off. Some tracks feel a bit too sluggish, while others are fast-paced and erratic, which can be a bit disorienting. However, this is a minor criticism in what is otherwise a fantastic album.

Overall, ""Circular Sounds"" is a brilliant addition to Kelley Stoltz's discography.

Cian Nugent,Night Fiction,Rock,7.3,January 27 2016,Pat Healy,Contributor,"The key to understanding Cian Nugent is ""Things Don't Change That Fast."" That's the title of the first single from Night Fiction. To begin, the Irish guitarist delicately strums the same chord five times, one for each time he sings a word in the title, demonstrating quite plainly that no, things don't change that fast. This ethos applies to Nugent's career—Night Fiction is his third album, but his first as a singer/songwriter—as well as his technique. On his earlier instrumental releases, he sometimes let the spaces between notes breathe so long that you'd be likely to find yourself checking the headphone jack to make sure you hadn't somehow become disconnected. These spaces don't appear much on Night Fiction; instead each song unwinds unhurried and the members of his backing band, the Cosmos, take their time making their presence known. Nugent is the type of guitarist who can dazzle with his attention to detail on the fretboard, as on the album's sole solo instrumental track, ""Lucy,"" but he is also content to ride out on one chord for several measures if the song calls for it. At first, the guitar feels too high in the mix—it's appropriate that the leadoff track is called ""Lost Your Way""—and the licks he plays sometimes feel like muscle-memory fills that could have come from the Jeff Healey Band, incongruous with the rest of the album. His voice is an ""if Kurt Vile can do it, so can I"" approximation, but Nugent makes braver and more inspired melodic choices. Even if his voice doesn't hit all of the right notes, there's an appealing warmth and conviction to his singing. Nugent also makes up for those irritating suburban-blues licks with his exquisite chordings and inspired solos. It also helps that the Cosmos are an especially dynamic backing band, sounding alternately as ferocious as Dirty Three or as mellow as the Section. His subject matter seems mostly to be interpersonal strains, and his words are simple, but wise and wide open for interpretation. The aforementioned ""Things Don't Change That Fast"" could be a monologue a practicing addict delivers to a recovering addict: ""There may be only one difference between the hopeless and the brave, one's too specific and the other's too vague,"" he sings. As with Nugent's previous releases, many of the songs start in one style to become something else altogether. ""Year of the Snake,"" the glorious final track on Night Fiction, spends its first minute with the guitar gradually uncoiling before the organ and viola eventually enter the fold. The cymbals and bass arrive by the third minute, and by minute four it has morphed into a ""Sister Ray""-like rave-up. Nugent is singing out by the seven-minute mark, sounding more like Pete Shelley than the occasionally flat voice he uses on the rest of the record. This is the catharsis promised at the beginning of the album: Things don’t change that fast, but when they do, they change dramatically, and for the better.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21383-night-fiction/,Woodsist,2016.0,"If you're looking for some new rock music to add to your collection, Cian Nugent's album, ""Night Fiction,"" is an absolute must-listen.

One of the things that stands out about Cian Nugent is their history. The band, which is based in Dublin, Ireland, has been around for over a decade. They're a favorite in the Irish music scene and have been building a following all over the world. With ""Night Fiction,"" they're back and better than ever, showcasing their innovative style and unwavering passion.

The creation story of this album is just as intriguing as the band's history. Nugent describes ""Night Fiction"" as a ""slow and difficult process,"" but the end result was well worth the effort. The album took about a year and a half to create, and the band poured their hearts and souls into every song. The album features a mix of classic rock sounds and modern elements, giving it a timeless quality that's truly unforgettable.

As I listened to ""Night Fiction,"" I found myself lost in the music. Every song is a masterpiece, skillfully recorded and arranged to perfection. The band's technical skill is impressive, but what really stands out is their ability to tell a story through their music. Every track has a unique story to tell, often filled with intricate themes and emotional depth.

Steve Reich,You Are (Variations),Experimental,8.0,January 9 2006,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Urban activity: buses moving; keypads clicking; bikers cutting off cabs; window washers scaling up a half completed skyscraper; the distant wail of an ambulance siren, and its sudden pitch modulation as it zooms past, carrying a rush of wind and a trail of receipts, wrappers, or the rare leaf; the clang of the subway; cash registers opening, closing, opening; everyone is counting something: time, money, appointments, each other; the whistle of a traffic cop and hundreds of half-heard conversations in the street. The flurry of the city isn't something best described as ""beautiful"" so much as alive, unstoppable, cruel, and complex. American composer (and native New Yorker) Steve Reich has been writing the definitive city soundtrack for 40 years. From his early tape pieces ""Come Out"" and ""It's Gonna Rain"", to his now classic minimalist works-- though Reich would certainly scoff at the term-- Drumming and Music For 18 Musicians, to more recent works bother greater in scope and somehow conventionally attractive (Tehillim, Different Trains, The Desert Music), he's invented a sound that nails both the intricate detail and speed-ridden blur of some abstract ""downtown."" Where Philip Glass's music from the 1960s and 70s is vaguely futuristic and precise, Reich's is warm. Where Terry Riley, who never felt a particularly strong allegiance to the minimal aesthetic in the first place, is boundless and organic, Reich is brainy, propulsive, and hardened to the interiors of a metallic landscape. I read someone call him the ""greatest living American composer,"" and though any all-encompassing title is debatable, you'd be hard pressed to find a more fitting example of individualism and stubborn will so often identified with this place. You Are (Variations). is Reich's first CD of new material since the not altogether warmly received Three Tales (2002). If the composer has suffered complaints from critics of lacking ambition in recent years, he hasn't let that affect his writing: You Are is prime Reich, using choral and orchestral elements similarly to older pieces like Tehillim and The Desert Music, but seeming as rhythmically driven as anything he's done in years. Harmonically, he sticks to majors and relative minors (that is, a minor key that utilizes the same notes as a major one, but starts from a different point in the scale)-- a common Reich device-- thereby blurring the line between different tonalities. He uses a choir to impart text translated from Hasidic mystical verse: ""You are wherever your thoughts are"", ""Explanations come to an end somewhere,"" and the idea of saying ""little and do much"". Words are repeated and spread out over great lengths, so the end effect is not one of narrative but of words as purely musical ingredients. The ""variations"" in You Are take up most of the CD, but the closing track is Reich's Cello Counterpoint, featuring cellist Maya Beiser (Bang On a Can) overdubbed eight times to create a surprisingly dense string ensemble. As Reich points out in the CD insert, the cello is great because its capable of resonating clearly in a very wide range-- this piece was actually written for a full string octet, but its marked accents and interweaving melodies sound great all performed by one person. There is a slight similarity to Different Trains for string quartet, though Cello Counterpoint is nowhere near as ""industrial,"" sounding more conventional, perhaps less confrontational, yet still unmistakably Reich. As with the You Are tracks, the constant rumble of motion fills up whatever mental space I have to drift away from the music.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6744-you-are-variations/,Nonesuch,2005.0,"You Are (Variations) by Steve Reich is a masterful work of experimental music that immediately grabs your attention with its unique soundscapes and hypnotic rhythms. From start to finish, this album takes you on a journey through a world of musical experimentation and exploration, leaving you spellbound and captivated by the sheer beauty of the sound.

Steve Reich has been at the forefront of the experimental music scene for decades, and his experience and expertise are on full display on this album. You can feel the depth of his artistic vision and the attention he pays to every single detail. It's almost as if he's trying to make you hear things in a completely new way.

The creation of this album is a fascinating story in and of itself. With You Are (Variations), Steve Reich wanted to explore the idea of musical variation, taking a single musical phrase and repeating it over and over again, each repetition slightly different from the last. This simple concept forms the backbone of the album, and the variations are expertly crafted, each one building on the other to create a rich and complex musical tapestry.

As someone who has listened to experimental music for years, I have to say that You Are (Variations) is truly a masterpiece. The attention to detail and the way that Reich has managed to craft such a mesmerizing sonic landscape is truly impressive. I especially enjoyed the way that the music feels like it's constantly evolving and changing, even as it repeats the same musical phrase over and over again.

In many ways, this album feels like a meditation on sound, with each variation and repetition inviting the listener to delve deeper into the music and explore the many textures and nuances that make it so special. I found myself getting lost in the music, transported to another world entirely, and it was truly a transformative experience.

Overall, if you're a fan of experimental music or just someone who wants to hear something truly unique and special, You Are (Variations) is an album that you simply have to hear. It's a stunning work of art that showcases the immense talent of Steve Reich and the power of music to transport us to new and amazing places.

Date Palms,The Dusted Sessions,,7.9,June 20 2013,Andrew Ryce,Contributor,"The vast desert of the southwestern U.S. has been an inspiration for musicians in all sorts of traditions. Increasingly it creeps into metal and psych, with late period Earth being a particularly strong example of rock that incorporates Western-style melodies and languid strokes meant to evoke the expanse. There’s something exotic but familiar about it, a beguiling quality that Oakland, CA's Date Palms nail to a tee. Riding a foundation of doom metal, psych rock, and mournful country, the group (now a quintet) led by Gregg Kowalsky and Marielle Jakobsons builds soundscapes with keyboards, mournful slide guitar, sitar, flute and a powerful electric bass. Their second album, The Dusted Sessions, ties together modern explorations of the Wild West with more traditional forms, infused with Americana but not giving into its clichés. What separates Date Palms from troves of drifting psych rock bands is their distinct sense of composition. These aren’t lengthy jams but painstakingly considered pieces that ebb and flow. The Dusted Sessions centers around a suite inspired by the Yuba River in California, once central to the Gold Rush and home to a vast Native American tribe that was all but wiped out. There’s a careful reverence to the three-part “Yuba Source”, with its central melody that winds wide like the broad curves of the river itself. As the quintet work their way through the track, they’re propped up by monstrous basslines that provide important momentum without ruffling feathers, and a constant sitar that shimmers like a pool of clear fresh water. The teasing melody of “Yuba Source”-- a simple three note blues phrase-- appears throughout the record, on “Yuba”'s second part and reprise. The group repeat these ideas like mantras, gently echoing so that an idea passes through each instrument as if it were being purified. Jakobsons’ violin, which emerges as the star of the record, takes these melodies and unwinds them out into long, soft strokes while the slide guitar dovetails gracefully beneath. Each track is defined by a different instrument, however. As tight of a unit as they are, Date Palms are also pretty versatile. On “Dusted Down”, a searing electric guitar rises above the dusty tumult, and on “Exodus Due West” Jakobsons’ reverbed flute haunts the landscape. Kowalsky’s keyboards play an almost equally important role, especially in creating a wall-of-sound effect, as on centerpiece “Night Riding the Skyland”. Especially breathtaking on the latter, the viola merges with the synth before it’s all broken up by the thrust of Noah Philips’ electric guitar, diving head-first into a blues jam that recalls early-70s Pink Floyd and other psychedelic cornerstones. That they can do all this on a single album is a testament to Date Palms’ ability and control as an ensemble. Even with 11-minute tracks, there’s not a moment that feels wasted; with so many different sounds and ideas invoked over The Dusted Sessions’ 44 minutes, there’s a clear idea at work even if it’s hard to quantify exactly what it is, which is where their brilliance lies. If the idea of Wild West-style slabs of desert rock doesn’t appeal to you, Kowalsky and Jakobsons will pull you in with their teasing melodies and weeping instruments anyway, their sound rough and immense like a sandpaper sky. On The Dusted Sessions they both deconstruct and reinforce the tenets of Americana and make something transcendent in the process.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18158-date-palms-the-dusted-sessions/,Thrill Jockey,2013.0,"The Dusted Sessions, the latest offering from Date Palms is a breath of fresh air in the world of nan music. With a rating of 7.9 out of 10, it is clear that they have struck a chord with fans of the genre. I had the pleasure of diving deep into this album and I have to say, it's a remarkable piece of work.

Date Palms, a duo consisting of Gregg Kowalsky and Marielle Jakobsons hail from sunny California. They first met in 2008 and quickly bonded over their shared love of experimental music, drone and psychedelic influences. Their unique sound is a mesmerizing blend of guitar, electronic ambiance and hypnotic rhythms. This album, The Dusted Sessions, marks their fifth release to date.

The creation story of this album is as fascinating as the music it produces. According to the band, the album title was inspired by the smoky, dusty atmosphere of the recording space, which was essentially an abandoned restaurant on the outskirts of San Francisco. The duo would set up in the restaurant's large kitchen, surrounded by rusty pots and pans, and let the space influence their musical output. The result is a warm, fuzzy, and at times, meditative sound.

As a listener and admirer of nan music, I was immediately drawn to the opening track ""Yuba Source Part I"". The layered guitar swells, combined with the deep bass tones, create a sense of tranquility that is hard to come by in today's fast-paced world. Throughout the album, Jakobsons and Kowalsky continue to weave together moments of sonic bliss, with tracks such as ""Six Hands To The Light"" offering a respite from the chaos of everyday life.

Personally, I found The Dusted Sessions to be immersive and transporting. The album pulls you into a world of its own, a world where time seems to stand still. Each track has its own unique flavor, its own distinctive mood, but all feel connected to a greater, underlying theme. At times, the music feels like a conversation between the artists and their instruments, with the sound ebbing and flowing like a river.

Umberto,Night Has a Thousand Screams,Electronic,6.1,December 4 2012,Nick Neyland,Contributor,"Pieces is a slasher horror feature from 1982 that revolves around a serial killer who tries to construct a jigsaw puzzle from human body parts. The idea of bastardizing existing forms appears to hold great appeal for Kansas City musician Matt Hill, who records schlocky instrumental fare indebted to a broad range of Z-grade giallo peddlers under the Umberto name. His prior work, of which the deathly Not Not Fun LP Prophecy of the Black Widow was a highlight, provided, in Hill's own words, ""soundtracks to films that don't exist"". There still isn't a bona fide soundtrack that bears the Umberto name, but he took one step closer to realizing that dream by performing the music on Night Has a Thousand Screams to a screening of Pieces at the Glasgow Music and Film Festival earlier this year. Mogwai's Stuart Braithwaite was in attendance at the screening, and subsequently offered to release the music on his Rock Action imprint. The results are a fractional advance on what came before, with the blood running a little thicker and brighter than prior Umberto releases. To draw on an analogy from the film work to which Hill is so clearly enthralled, Night of a Thousand Screams is like picking up a copy of Buddy Giovinazzo's masterfully frayed Combat Shock after gorging on the base slice and dice chills of the Friday the 13th  series. *Prophecy'*s opening cut, ""Temple Room"", was a piece of Claudio Simonetti worship that was both a little too in awe of its source and lacking in the necessary tools to make it ooze under your skin. In short, it felt like a tinny replica cowering in the wake of a far bolder creation. Goblin's work was purposefully big, with every power chord designed to hammer into your chest. It's no wonder Justice found so much much fertile territory to mine from the band's output on Audio, Video, Disco. Hill has wisely chosen not to match Simonetti at his game here, instead edging toward the low rent chills of Italian soundtrack master Fabio Frizzi, in particular his superior City of the Living Dead score. The influence of Frizzi is primarily manifested in the choral work, presumably lifted from Hill's sample library. It's a great sweep of male humming that resurfaces at pertinent points in the record, reaching a maximal crescendo during the appropriately named final track, ""End Credits"". Night Has a Thousand Screams is structured around subtly repeating motifs like that, subtly bringing back small keyboard parts to mirror the way a horror film will often return to its central theme song. At its worst it borders on a barely palatable mesh of kitsch and homage, such as the cheap Ghost Box knock-off ""Paralyzed"". It's when Hill reaches into purposefully more restrained areas that the album picks up its eerie glow. ""The Puzzle"" is a brief, beatless passage full of cold vapors; ""The Pool"" is even better, combining thudding keys with further choral enhancements that briefly make it sound like a lost Lamberto Bava score composed by Popol Vuh. Similar moments of inspiration arise sporadically on Night Has a Thousand Screams, but the overall feel is often tugged down by Hill's tendency to lapse into genre exercises. He creates his own world through work like ""The Waterbed"", which succeeds by melding sparse, hissy textures with a sudden jolt into a stiffly mechanized final third full of siren wails. In a market flooded with electronic acts reaching toward horror soundtrack work to fulfill their ""dark"" remit, it often feels like supply is far outweighing demand, making it hard to stand out from the pack. Hill's work is steadily gaining its own hue, and this album is a step toward a recognizable Umberto sound that won't instantly be tagged with all the influences he so adores. It's interesting that he's had a minor breakthrough by having some visual stimulus to compose around. A fully-fledged soundtrack assignment might push him even harder to create his own recognizable strain of musical terror.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17385-night-has-a-thousand-screams/,Rock Action,2012.0,"When it comes to Umberto's album ""Night Has a Thousand Screams,"" one can't help but feel like they are being transported to a dark, dystopian world. The electronic beats and haunting melodies create a soundscape that is both ominous and alluring.

For those unfamiliar with Umberto, he is a musician, composer, and filmmaker based in Los Angeles. He is known for his work in the horror genre, and ""Night Has a Thousand Screams"" certainly lives up to that reputation. This album was created as the soundtrack for a short horror film of the same name, and it succeeds in setting a chilling tone.

The album opens with ""The Night,"" which sets the stage for what is to come with its eerie opening notes. From there, we are led on a journey through the darkness with tracks like ""Death Mask,"" ""Black Candles,"" and ""The Investigation."" The use of synthesizers and other electronic instruments creates an otherworldly atmosphere that is both mesmerizing and disturbing.

While ""Night Has a Thousand Screams"" may not be for everyone, it is clear that Umberto has a strong vision and executes it flawlessly throughout the album. The soundscapes he creates are fully immersive and transport the listener to a world that is both frightening and beautiful.

As someone who enjoys horror films and dark music, I found this album to be a captivating experience. However, I can see how others may find it too intense or unsettling. It's definitely not something you'd want to listen to before bed!

Overall, I would give ""Night Has a Thousand Screams"" a rating of 6.1 out of 10. While I appreciate the artistry and craftsmanship that went into the album, I don't see myself listening to it on repeat. But for those who enjoy horror music or want to channel their inner goth, it's definitely worth checking out.","- Both reviews discuss Umberto's album ""Night Has a Thousand Screams"" and mention its connection to the horror genre.
- Review A goes into more detail about the background of the album, its influences, and its strengths and weaknesses, whereas Review B is more focused on describing the atmosphere and soundscapes of the album.
- Review A references specific tracks and compares them to other horror soundtracks, whereas Review B simply lists track names without much elaboration.
- Review A also includes more complex language and sentence structure, with references to specific people and events, suggesting that it was likely written by a human.
- On the other hand, Review B uses simpler language and more straightforward descriptions and opinions, which could be indicative of a model-generated review.

Pep Llopis,Poiemusia La Nau Dels Argonautes,Experimental,7.6,July 8 2017,Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,"Some of the best reissue labels, like Soul Jazz, Numero Group, and Light in the Attic, made their mark by unearthing sounds that most of us never knew existed. They give names to them and put frames around them—a taxonomical project that has brought us essential compendiums of Ohio proto-punk, private-press new age music, and psychedelic country from the early ’70s, to name just a few pins in our ever-expanding musical atlas. RVNG Intl.’s Freedom to Spend imprint takes the opposite tack. Instead of creating alternative canons, it’s plucking obscure records from the ether and presenting them as standalone curios. Co-founders Pete Swanson, Jed Bindeman, and Matt Werth are interested, they say, in confusing the timeline, in sidestepping the historical frame to engage strangeness and wonder head-on. For its first few releases since re-launching earlier this year, after a trial run nearly a decade ago, Freedom to Spend has swung its lens widely. First there was Eye Chant, a 1986 album of synthesizer music recorded in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania by Michele Mercure (aka Michele Musser); then came the Seattle electronic musician Marc Barreca’s Music Works for Industry, a 1983 cassette of sleek electro and wry anti-capitalism. The label’s third release stems from the same time period and thousands of miles to the east: the Mediterranean city of Valencia, Spain. Pep Llopis’ 1987 album Poiemusia La Nau Dels Argonautes makes for a good opportunity to meet the label’s challenge of listening without prejudice. Mixing the sounds of classical minimalism with period electronics, folk melodies, and chanted poetry in Catalan, it’s the most unusual thing they’ve put out yet. Long a sought-after prize by record collectors, the album is, fittingly enough, driven by the spirit of the quest. Llopis began writing the music after the dissolution of his previous band, the progressive rock group Cotó-en-Pèl, sent him sailing across the Mediterranean, island-hopping from Menorca to Crete, Lesbos, and Santorini. Inspiration from Wim Mertens and Philip Glass spun in his head along with the Greek music he had brought back from the Aegean; it was an encounter with the Valencian poet Salvador Jàfer’s collection Navegant obscur that pointed him toward the final form of the piece, in which Jàfer’s poetry—not so much spoken as chanted—infused the music with the dark, swirling pulse of the open sea. Llopis and his ensemble performed a version of the piece at Valencia’s Poiemusia, a 1986 festival of contemporary composition and poetry, and he recorded the album in early 1987, utilizing a limited set of instruments—cello, flute, clarinet, vibraphone, marimba, and keyboards—and with Jàfer himself reciting the text, accompanied by the late actress Montse Anfruns. The album was released later that year on Madrid’s Grabaciones Accidentales, home also to the Iberian Fourth World sounds of Finis Africae. All these points of reference can help orient you within Poiemusia’s waters, but the listening experience itself requires few footnotes. Llopis’ work makes no secret of its debt to composers like Glass, Mertens, and Steve Reich: Throughout most of the album’s five tracks, contrapuntal arpeggios spin like wheels within wheels, with diverse acoustic and electronic timbres fusing into a sumptuous sound as dynamic as the play of light on choppy water. (The lone exception is “Nits de Cristall,” a beautiful, piano-led piece that brings Satie and Debussy to mind.) Minimalism’s sense of moving while standing still is balanced by a forceful compositional hand that emphasizes major shifts from passage to passage—not unlike jibing and tacking in the wind. Both individually and as a set, the five tracks have a strong narrative feel, with chapter-like arrangements and mirroring sections. “El Vell Rei De La Serp” begins with a lengthy passage of bowed cello and gentle flute before shifting into tumbling pulse-minimalism mode; after five minutes of rising pitch and growing complexity, all the instruments drop out save a faint whistle, and a two-minute coda brings us back to the flute-and-cello theme of the opening. In a similar maneuver, the whole album is bookended by the drifting synths that suggest the stillness of the harbor that lies on either side of the journey. The text, however, is not narrative. Jàfer’s impressionistic poetry emphasizes striking visual imagery—“Bees and slugs, honey and liquefied wax”; “Mysteries, algae, lips”—and its incantations begin to assume an almost liturgical feel. You don’t need to understand Catalan to appreciate the sonority of the voices, particularly when they are subtly processed through vocoder-like effects. Swirled into the music, the voices contribute to an overall effect that is like painting in sound and word, and just enough of the text cuts through to trigger unexpected associations in the listener’s mind. (“Moriré amb l’enyorança/De no ser un jaguar,” goes one particularly potent line which is bound to resonate, whatever your degree of exposure to various Romance languages.) Poiemusia La Nau Dels Argonauts is an album of oceanic currents, of cultural exchange, with a shape dictated by the rhythms of both the sea and the journey. Despite its late-’80s provenance, it still sounds both futuristic and faintly medieval. It might as well be a message in a bottle washed up with no returning address—a fine example of Freedom to Spend’s vision of historical music that strikes home like a bolt from the blue.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pep-llopis-poiemusia-la-nau-dels-argonautes/,Freedom to Spend,1987.0,"Experimental music can be an acquired taste, but Pep Llopis' album 'Poiemusia La Nau Dels Argonautes' makes a compelling argument for exploring this genre deeper. With a rating of 7.6 out of 10, this album showcases a unique blend of sounds that defy convention and resonate with audiences.

To appreciate this album fully, it's essential to understand Pep Llopis' background. Born in Valencia, Spain, Llopis was exposed to a diverse array of musical influences from a young age. He dabbled in traditional and folk music before eventually gravitating towards experimental and avant-garde sounds.

'Poiemusia La Nau Dels Argonautes' is no exception to Llopis' experimental approach to music-making. The album is a result of his deep fascination with electronic music and his exploration of its possibilities. It features an array of instruments, ranging from the traditional folk instruments of his homestead to electronic ones, and blends them in a unique and intricate way.

The album's creation story is equally intriguing. Llopis spent over two years composing and recording the album in his home studio. The recording process was an intimate one, as he experimented, tinkered, and fine-tuned each song until it reached its full potential.

The standout track on the album, 'Africa Imaginada,' is a prime example of this meticulous attention to detail. The song features a sample of a traditional African song, which Llopis manipulates and layers multiple times, adding new soundscapes with each pass. The result is a hypnotic and rich tapestry of sound that's impossible to ignore.

While this album might not appeal to everyone, it offers a unique listening experience that's worth exploring. Personally, I found myself transported to another world while listening to it. Each song felt like a journey, taking me on a sonic adventure that was both exhilarating and intimidating.

In conclusion, 'Poiemusia La Nau Dels Argonautes' is a testament to Pep Llopis' talent and his commitment to pushing the boundaries of music. It's an album that demands your attention and rewards you with an unparalleled listening experience.","1.

Simply Saucer,Cyborgs Revisited,Rock,8.8,August 18 2003,Chris Dahlen,,"Let's say you're skeptical when you flip through the liner notes and read quote after quote, all from reputable rock publications, praising Cyborgs Revisited as nothing less than ""the greatest Canadian rock album ever."" And sure, they overreacted, but you understand, because this is everything a cult album should be: the only trace of a lost band that was so exciting, but so obscure it's a wonder there's anything to remember them by at all. This album first came out in 1989, a full decade after Simply Saucer had broken up. Flipping through the small booklet, you can read countless anecdotes of rock band purgatory: gigs that almost sparked riots, others that did nothing at all, rough demos, stolen gear, and of course, continuous line-up changes. In spite of it all, the band kept experimenting-- like the time they cranked up the feedback in their Hamilton, Ontario rehearsal space, and went outside to see if they could hear it (they could), locking themselves out in the process. The local firemen who had to let the band back inside described it as ""the loudest sound heard in these parts since World War II."" Here's a band that could splice the DNA of Syd Barrett and Soft Machine with Iggy Pop and the Velvet Underground, that could bridge post-psychedelic mind-altering electronics with a buzzed proto-punk urgency: the ultimate garage band, rehearsing constantly and trying everything and doing it all at top fucking volume. And right after they finally got around to issuing their debut release, a well-received seven-inch, in 1978, the band split and became history. The saga, however, was just getting underway. Longtime Saucer fan Bruce ""Mole"" Mowat uncovered enough of the band's material in the late 1980s to assemble an actual posthumous full-length album. A one-single cult band that could have been consigned to Nuggets III: Original Artyfacts from the Northern Territories and Beyond instead captured their own spotlight. Mowat culled nine songs from a forgotten studio session and a free afternoon show at a shopping center, and crazily, they're all so fantastic that you can properly call them a legacy. The studio cuts come from a 1974 session recorded by Bob Lanois in his and brother Daniel's basement studio (the live set was recorded a year later). We'll never know what the band's original epic setpieces sounded like, but apparently, by this point, frontman and main songwriter Edgar Breau was cutting the material down into more concise songs (if jarring and very eccentric ones)-- it's all the fury of the band's live sprawl crammed into the most condensed possible space. These sessions are explosive, with Breau playing the space-rock guitar hero while Ping Romany works out on Moog synth and some other analog electronics. The three live tracks, meanwhile, see the band stretching out: drums and bass gallop through on ""Illegal Bodies"", setting up a noisy busy-circuit solo from Romany that sets the stage for Breau's most precise, shrieking guitar attack. Even at a free show on a Saturday afternoon you can tell these guys were an absolutely crushing entity in the flesh. But jams and noise-rock don't always ossify well onto vinyl. Which brings us back to the songs: a whole set of garage rock classics that are both ecstatic and bluntly riff-bound. Breau wrote lyrics that were strikingly direct-- from ""Instant Pleasure""'s demand for carnal reward, to ""Nazi Apocalypse""'s crass punk humor, to ""Bullet Proof Nothing"", which just keeps demanding, ""Treat me like dirt."" And though Breau's voice, while strong and clear, has no actual remarkable qualities (I'm saying he'd never stand out in a garage-rocker line-up), it's the perfect counterbalance to the music, grounding Simply Saucer's instrumental flights and Romany's ""third ear"" electronics. Sonic Unyon's reissue collects the 1989 album, and also tacks on a half hour of rehearsal and live tapes. The later material (dating from '77 and '78) has the band arcing away from psychedelia and closer to proto-punk; Ping Romany has quit and Steve Parks has joined the band on second guitar. The bonus tracks sound rough but they include some gems, like the bluesy ""Low Profile"" demo or the album's only ballad, the affecting ""Yes I Do"". Sonic Unyon also included the first CD issue of the band's single, ""I Can Change My Mind"", along with its flipside, ""She's a Dog"". The single deservedly made waves in its day, landing them a touring slot with Pere Ubu, but the band sounds diminished on it: the songs are jagged, semi-chaotic shards of sneer-punk with lyrics that snarl but that never hinge off the groin like the band's earlier work. It shouldn't have ended there-- the band were slated to record an official full-length before they disbanded-- though it is hard to imagine how this band could have improved on Cyborgs Revisited; ""I Can Change My Mind"" and ""She's a Dog"", in particular, seem like formal grade school portraits after all the candid craziness that came before them. With all their ideas and influences it's unbelievable that we could catch them at a point of such balance, but that might have been because they didn't freeze up to perfect it. Simply Saucer made their defining statement without even knowing it. How can you beat that?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7704-cyborgs-revisited/,"Sonic Unyon,Mole Sound,Sonic Unyon,Mole Sound",1989.0,"If you're in the mood for something a little dark and brooding, Simply Saucer's ""Cyborgs Revisited"" is a perfect album to dive into. This album is a must-hear for any rock enthusiast, with its compelling sound and intricate instrumentals. I'd give it a solid 8.8 out of 10.

Simply Saucer is not your typical rock band, and this album is the perfect representation of that. They have been around since the 1970s, but only released their first album in 2014. So, when I discovered that ""Cyborgs Revisited"" was actually the band's long-lost second album, I knew I had to check it out.

The story behind the creation of this album is fascinating. The band recorded it back in the 70s, but it was never released due to issues with the record label. Thanks to some determined fans and a few lucky breaks, the album was finally unearthed and released in 2018, more than 40 years after it was recorded.

Now, let's talk about the music itself. ""Cyborgs Revisited"" is a beautiful mix of dark, psychedelic, and punk rock. The album's sound is incredibly unique, with its swirling synths, wailing guitars, and driving bass lines perfectly encapsulating the band's vision. The songs take you on a journey, with each one drawing you deeper into the world that Simply Saucer has created.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Dance the Mutation."" It starts off with a haunting synth line, then explodes into a flurry of drums and guitars that perfectly captures the song's dark energy. Another standout track is ""Mole Machine,"" with its driving rhythm and eerie theremin adding to the sense of unease that permeates the album.

Overall, ""Cyborgs Revisited"" is a fantastic album that showcases Simply Saucer's incredible talent and gives you a glimpse into the punk rock scene of the 70s. It's a must-hear for any rock fan who is looking for something a little different. To me, this album has all the makings of a cult classic, and I'm thrilled to have discovered it.","1.

Andrew Bird,Andrew Bird & the Mysterious Production of Eggs,Rock,8.3,March 10 2005,David Raposa,Contributor,"This album begins with Andrew Bird referencing Wagner's epochal ""Ride of the Valkyries""; it ends with a narrator asking someone to sing him ""Happy Birthday"" ""like it's gonna be your last day on earth"". In between are disheartening references to psychoanalysis, economic ruin, the slow death of living, and couplets such as: ""You're what happens when two substances collide/ And by all accounts, you really should have died"". But while the lyrics here are the stuff of sleepless nights and empty liquor bottles, the sonics belie any gloom or doom. The music on Eggs is ebullient, starting with a nameless, minute-long intro that features Bird's winding wind-swept violin and beguiling whistling. That's right, whistling-- he's credited as a ""professional whistler"" in his bio, and since he can make the breath passing between his lips sound like a singing saw or a radiant theremin, I'm willing to take him at his word. As for the violin, Bird's trademark instrument-- it's all over the album, but it's not what the album is about. Any plucking or sawing or twittering is done in service of the track at hand, not as a grand flourish of technique. The CD's accompanying insert features fantastic illustrations by Jay Ryan, one for each song on the album. At first glance, Ryan's drawings look like half-finished sketches, with faint pencil marks still visible in the finished picture. These sketch lines, rather than making the artwork seem sloppy or half-ass, give the pictures a sense of motion, a frisky kinetic energy reflected in the music. Whether the song is slow and somber, like the gentle ""Masterfade"", or contagiously upbeat, like Bird's musical nod to ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", ""Fake Palindromes"", there's a looseness and freshness to the playing. Even though this record took three years to finish, it has the life and verve of a one-take, time-is-money recording session. Such verve is also evident in the words themselves. For the most part, Bird eschews straight-forward storytelling, opting instead to drench the listener with wordplay and imagery. He might send you to the dictionary a few times, but there's nothing wrong with a little research. He might also sideswipe you with seemingly random lines-- ""Memories like mohair sweaters/ Stretched and pilled faux distressed letters/ Moose's horns and figure eights/ White plastic bags in search of mates""-- but Bird's love of language is so evident in lines like this that it's easy to forgive him his excesses and missteps. All this talk about lyrics isn't to say they'll ever get in the way of enjoying the record. They're there if you want them, but you can still savor the fantastic popcraft of Eggs without giving a damn about what's being said. Andrew Bird's voice is the spoonful of sugar that makes this medicine go down so smooth. Much like his violin playing and his whistling and his songwriting, Bird's voice is versatile, simultaneously recalling Paul Simon's conversational croon, Rufus Wainwright's self-aware drama, and Thom Yorke's mournful wail. He can hang on one word and give it emotional heft, and he can nail a line like ""and I'm gonna tie your wrists with leather/ and drill a tiny hole in your head"" with the nonchalant whimsy it requires. Ultimately, whimsy leavened with wisdom and humor is what typifies this album. When Bird sings, ""Sing me 'Happy Birthday'/ Sing like it's going to be your last day,"" it's a call for carpe diem, not a requiem. The Mysterious Production of Eggs might wrestle with unsavory topics, but it does so with a shrug of the shoulders, a wry smile, and a heart full of awe-inspiring song.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/714-andrew-bird-the-mysterious-production-of-eggs/,Righteous Babe,2005.0,"Andrew Bird's ""The Mysterious Production of Eggs"" is a true gem in the world of rock music. With an impressive rating of 8.3 out of 10, the album showcases the talents of a man who has spent years perfecting his craft. Combining unique instruments and an almost unknown genre, Bird creates a world of sound that is both captivating and thought-provoking.

For those who may not know, Andrew Bird is an American multi-instrumentalist known for his distinctive sound that blends elements of gypsy jazz, indie rock, and folk music. Bird gained popularity in the early 2000s with his album ""Andrew Bird & the Mysterious Production of Eggs."" The album was a significant departure from his past works, featuring a more stripped-down sound that highlighted the raw lyrics and intricate melodies.

""The Mysterious Production of Eggs"" is a product of Bird's evolution from a traditional violinist to a solo artist who layers intricate soundscapes with loops and effects. In the album, he showcases his unique ability to blend a wide range of sounds from various instruments like guitars, violins, horns, and drums into one cohesive and compelling album. 

That being said, ""The Mysterious Production of Eggs"" is not an album for everyone. Those who prefer traditional rock music may find the album's unique sound challenging to embrace. Yet, if you're open to something new, this album is worth a listen.

Personal favourites from the album include the melancholic yet endearing “Sovay”, the enchanting “Masterfade”, and the quirky “Spare-Ohs”. The latter is especially notable for its distinctive lyrics, blending storytelling and wittiness with a catchy melody. Something about the song just captures the listener's imagination in a way that's hard to explain.

In summary, Andrew Bird's ""The Mysterious Production of Eggs"" is a testament to his artistry, his ability to create an album that's both distinctive and thought-provoking. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, those who are looking for a unique and memorable musical experience will find it here.","1.

The Game,The Documentary,Rap,8.3,January 18 2005,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"A couple of months ago, Vibe published an article lamenting the decline of New York hip-hop. With Southern and Midwestern rappers rising to prominence over the past few years, the birthplace of hip-hop has only constituted about a third of rap radio playlists. But the article's unspoken question was: What's going on with the West? A pie chart showed that California rappers only constituted around 3% of those same playlists-- a far cry from the early 90s, when Dr. Dre, 2pac, and Snoop Dogg all but owned the rap landscape. Since then, 2pac's been gunned down, Snoop and Ice Cube have fallen off hard, and DJ Quik and the Bay Area scene have had little success breaking through to the mainstream. Dre's kept his name in circulation by producing Eminem and 50 Cent-- but even he hasn't released material under his own name since 1999, constantly delaying the release of his supposed masterpiece, Detox. So The Game, Dre's newest protégé, has a lot riding on him. The Compton MC made a name for himself on the mixtape scene that made 50 Cent a star; it made perfect sense for him to become the first West Coast representative of G-Unit. And having spent the past few months embroiled in pointless beefs with also-rans like Joe Budden and Yukmouth-- and getting hammered from all sides-- Game needs more than ever to deliver a debut to back up his talk. Now he has: The Documentary is the best West Coast street-rap album since DJ Quik's 2002 LP Under tha Influence. All of the G-Unit solo albums thus far have been aesthetically unified, a rarity in hip-hop; the tracks on The Documentary actually sound like they belong on the same album. Dre produces five of the album's 17 songs, applying his recent stripped-down cinematic style, and many of the record's other producers follow his lead. Superstar beatmakers like Timbaland and Kanye West hold back on their signature tics, fitting their usual approaches into the album's fabric. The end result is a rich, triumphant sonic tapestry; you can hear every dollar that went into it. The Game is not a particularly singular rapper. His hoarse, guttural voice doesn't possess any of the relaxed menace of classic West Coast rappers; he sounds more like Tha Dogg Pound member Daz Dillinger than Eazy or Snoop or The D.O.C. He has an appealing confidence and an unforced lyrical toughness, though: ""I spit for the niggas doing 25 on they fifth year, ready to throw a nigga off the fifth tier/ For the white boys in the Abercrombie & Fitch, yeeah/ And every nigga who helped me to get here,"" he rhymes on the dramatic and brutally hard Just Blaze banger ""Church for Thugs"". Unfortunately, he also frequently sounds awkward on hooks, seemingly hoping that simply repeating the same phrases a few times will suffice. In fact, many of the best tracks are the ones on which 50 steps in to deliver the hook, like the bananas single ""How We Do"", where 50 pushes the music-box Dre beat perfectly. Throughout the album, Game seems obsessed with his place in rap history, constantly name-checking Dre and Eazy-E; on ""Dreams"", he spits, ""The dream of Erik Wright, that's what I'm giving you/ Who walked through the White House without a business suit/ Compton hat, jheri curl dripping on Ronald Reagan's shoes."" But the impeccable beats and The Game's authoritative gruffness carry him through the album; he never sounds like anything less than a star on the rise. Only at the album's end, however, does he reveal his greatest gift: a powerful, heartfelt vulnerability. On ""Like Father, Like Son"", the album's final track, he tells of the birth of his son. Over Needlez' melodramatic, string-laden track, he raps, ""Nose, ears, eyes, chin just like your daddy/ I'll die before you grow up and be just like your daddy."" Same rhyme or not, it lends a stark humanity to Game's sometimes empty braggadocio.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3663-the-documentary/,"Interscope,Aftermath,G-Unit",2005.0,"If you're a fan of rap music, you've probably heard of The Game. The Compton-based rapper released his debut album, The Documentary, in 2005, and it quickly became a classic in the genre. With a rating of 8.3 out of 10, it's no surprise that this album is still beloved by fans today.

The Documentary has a unique blend of classic West Coast beats and that new-school rap sound. It's evident that the album was created with a lot of effort and thought. The Game's lyrical prowess and storytelling abilities are showcased throughout the album, which is a testament to his ability to captivate listeners with his words.

When The Game released The Documentary, he was already a well-known figure in the hip-hop community. But the album solidified his place as a force to be reckoned with. What makes this album so special is its collaborations. There are appearances from big names like 50 Cent, Nate Dogg, and Eminem, which elevate the overall sound of the album. The Game's introspective and honest lyrics are best exemplified in the song ""Dreams,"" which tells a poignant story of his life, from his early struggles to his current success.

One thing that sets The Documentary apart from other rap albums is its personal storytelling. The Game raps about his experiences and his upbringing, with every song providing a glimpse into his perspective of life. This gives the album a unique depth that is generally missing in modern day rap.

It's clear that The Documentary is a well-crafted, well-executed album that has rightfully earned its place in hip-hop history.

Comethazine,Bawskee,Rap,2.6,September 7 2018,Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,"Put a team of desperate record executives looking to cash-in on a demographic that looks at No Jumper podcast host Adam22 as this generation’s Barbara Walters, and the result is Comethazine. The 20-year old St. Louis rapper is designed to be an amalgamation of everything that has worked on SoundCloud before him: edgy, polarizing, iconoclastic. The result is anything but, an unoriginal and outdated rip-off attempting to fool a generation obsessed with stardom into thinking he is a star. These qualities contribute to Comethazine’s debut album Bawskee, a project that tries so badly to force its way into the SoundCloud upper echelon that it ends up birthing one of the most wretched and stylistically unappealing projects to come from the scene. In early 2018, Comethazine’s blatant attempts at manipulating his way into the limelight came to a head when his early single “Bands” bait-and-switched its way into the elusive No. 1 spot on the SoundCloud charts. A SoundCloud page by the name of SoundClout had posted YBN Nahmir’s “Bounce Out With That,” which was making waves on YouTube but had yet to be posted to SoundCloud. Almost instantly, it shot up to the platform’s top spot. Once there, the page took advantage of SoundCloud’s ability to swap sound files at any time and replaced “Bounce Out With That” with Comethazine’s “Bands,” making it appear that this relatively new rapper had hot-shotted all the way to having the most popular song on the platform. The song was eventually removed, and his label Alamo Records put out a vague “oops oh well” quote laughing off the foolery. Quickly on Bawskee, it becomes evident that the SoundCloud file-swapping scheme was the only original idea ever associated with Comethazine. Borrowing flows and aesthetics has always been a part of hip-hop, but there is not a single point throughout the 18-track album—loaded with short little ad-lib marathons—where we get any insight to who the hell Comethazine actually is. The thievery is soulless as Comethazine doesn’t just reach for a flow but instead tries to copy the entire essence of an artist. Over the empty and heartless drums of “V12” he rips every aspect of Lil Pump: the jumpy ad-libs, the flow, and even the obsession with a former child star: “Demi Lovato my bitch but I’m still out here fucking these females.” His burglary extends to artists throughout the SoundCloud world: the BHUNNA-produced “Sick Shit” sounds like a Pi’erre Bourne type beat that’s been left on the shelf and Comethazine’s voice is hardly recognizable like a low-quality Playboi Carti leak that was never meant to see the light. Essentially, Comethazine is not engaged with the genre of music he makes. The album is out of touch with the current direction of SoundCloud as if Comethazine hasn’t logged onto the site since the 2016 XXL Freshman List. The drums on tracks like “No Ex” sound leftover from an ancient 808 Mafia drum kit. And the speaker-blaring kicks on “Blicky” belong on an XXXTentacion project from his “Look At Me!” era. Even the features feel like hail marys, a last-ditch effort for some clicks by recruiting a tired Lil Yachty and a lost Ugly God clinging to relevance. Comethazine seems to think that to be a SoundCloud star you need to be edgy. He creates a running gag throughout Bawskee about how he wants to sleep with Demi Lovato that plays out uncomfortably. On “Demi,” Comethazine’s trollish obsession with the pop singer is just not charming, at all: “I just wanna fuck Demi, nut on her titties/Whip out my cock, ayy, make that bitch lick it.” He then leans on some homophobic jabs on “Let It Eat” which don’t make an attempt at sounding the least bit clever: “Sweet ass nigga, you belong in a Gay bar.” And his humor rubs off on Yachty who drops a line on “Bring Dat Bag Out” (”Got them white folks saying ni**er/Got them black folks saying cracker”) that makes you ask the question: What the hell is fun about any of this? It’s rare you come across an album as hollow as Bawskee. It’s so worthless across the board that you fear it might tarnish everything the SoundCloud scene has built from association alone. Comethazine is joyless, making an album that some executive must’ve told him will make his Instagram Live numbers spike. He is a vapid figure who has not developed a personality, direction, or sense of his own style, left to collect dust once the No Jumper diehards and out of touch label heads move on to their next cash-grab obsession.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/comethazine-bawskee/,Alamo,2018.0,"Comethazine's sophomore album Bawskee is a mixtape that has been gaining a lot of attention in the rap community. With a rating of 2.6 out of 10, Bawskee might seem like a disappointment at first. However, after listening to the album multiple times, I can confirm that this album is a masterpiece in its own right.

Comethazine started his career on SoundCloud, using the platform to drop freestyles and songs. His fast flow and relatable lyrics quickly gained him a large following. This underground fame eventually led to Comethazine signing with Alamo Records and his debut album, Bawskee, being released in 2018. He quickly followed this up with Bawskee 2, which features a darker and more introspective sound.

Bawskee 2 is a 30-minute barrage of hard beats and aggressive rapping. Comethazine's flow is fast, almost too fast to follow at times. However, this is what makes the album so uniquely Comethazine. He raps with a certain intensity that only he knows how to deliver. The beats on Bawskee 2 are minimalist and grimy, perfectly complementing Comethazine's dark lyrics.

The album's creation story can be traced back to 2018 when Comethazine signed with Alamo Records. He moved from St. Louis to Los Angeles to start working on his debut album, Bawskee. After the success of Bawskee, Comethazine focused on working on Bawskee 2. He spent months in the recording studio perfecting his flow and finding the perfect beats to match his lyrics.

The production on Bawskee 2 is also something to be admired. The beats are dark, minimalistic, and truly match the aesthetic of the album perfectly. The beats allow for Comethazine's vocals to really shine and showcase what he's capable of doing as a rapper.

As someone who enjoys rap music, I found the album to be truly impressive. While some might argue that the album's fast pace and aggressive flow can be overwhelming, I believe that's what makes Comethazine so unique. His flow and lyrics are unmatched in the rap game, and this album is proof of that.

If you're a fan of hard-hitting beats and intense flows, Bawskee 2 is an album that you need to add to your rotation. While it may not have received the highest rating, it's an album that shouldn't be slept on. I highly recommend giving it a listen and don't be surprised if it quickly becomes one of your go-to albums.","Step 1: Review A is longer and provides more detail and substance than Review B.

Companion,Companion,,6.5,February 15 2013,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"Companion is the project of the singer/songwriter Pepi Ginsberg, who released a few appealingly loose, lo-fi records on Park the Van under her own name. As Companion, however, she's almost unrecognizable as her former self: Armed with some glowing, magic-hour production, booming drums, and her trembling, emotive voice, she offers her personal vision of a big tent pop record, and it's a compellingly weird and personal one. ""I was listening to a lot of Hot 97,"" she has said, which explains absolutely nothing save for perhaps reaffirming the basic mysteriousness of music-making: She went on a strict diet of Hot 97, and somehow emerged with a project that resembles Kate Bush singing Gloria Estefan. Go figure. Whatever her influences, they moved Ginsberg to some of the most charged, vivid songwriting of her career, starting with the ripe opener ""20th Century Crime"". Set to a watery, oscillating synth part that evokes a blue John Hughes skyline, she sings in a delicate puff of head voice on the verses before opening up into the glorious, stretched-out melisma of the chorus. She has a fluttery, decentered approach to singing-- somewhere between R&B theatrics and Natasha Khan doing vocal warm-ups-- that is intriguingly wayward, and it leads many of the songs on Companion through odd detours. ""No Kid/Blast"", for example, starts as a slow-burning lover's lament (""You, you, you/ You treat me like an arrow/ You shoot me into places/ I don't wanna go""), Ginsberg bending notes soulfully on the chorus. The guitar smears its tone into a Grizzly Bear-ish blot, Ginsberg stacks her voice in layers of harmony, and then itchy drums and post-punkish guitars break out, starting a panicky dance party that settles back down just as it gets going. Every song comes with at least one cheap-seats hook, but the album's tone is unsettled, seemingly unsure of how arty or how straightforward it wants to be, and it makes Companion a genuinely unpredictable listen. Some of these songs digress so often that they end up banging their heads away in corners; ""Homegirl"" interrupts itself repeatedly in its three minutes without making a point. Companion feels like a band hashing out its identity, and there are portions (the drifting instrumental coda to""Swimming/Wave"") where the listener feels like taking a bathroom break to leave them to it. The quirks that make Ginsberg's vision personal and unusual detract from the record's streamlined nature; pared down, it would almost certainly hit harder. As it is, Companion is a dramatic, ambitious record that falls a few inches short of its target. Ginsberg and co. aren't quite ""there"" yet; they sound like a band opening up for the band they ultimately want to become. But you can hear nervy exhilaration in Companion's best moments: ""Welcome the new age,"" Ginsberg exults on ""New Age/Real Change"". Hopefully with a few more anthemic warm-up stretches, they'll get there.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17751-companion-companion/,Self-released,2013.0,"If you're a fan of indie music, then you're in for a treat with Companion's self-titled album. The band, consisting of members Jane, Tom, and Alex, has been making music together for almost a decade. Their experience and chemistry truly shine through in this latest album which blends elements of folk, rock, and electronic soundscapes into an ethereal listening experience.

Companion has a unique approach to creating music. Rather than working on individual songs, they set out to create a cohesive album, allowing the songs to flow into each other seamlessly. This is evident throughout the album as transitions between tracks are smooth, creating an almost cinematic experience.

The album opens with ""Lost in Translation,"" a dreamy synth soundscape that sets the tone for the rest of the album. The haunting vocals and poetic lyrics transport the listener to a world of introspection and self-discovery. ""Ghost"" is another standout track, featuring a groovy bassline and a catchy chorus that will have you singing along.

One of the strengths of this album is how it manages to blend different genres while still staying true to its unique sound. ""Runaway"" has a folk-inspired acoustic guitar riff that builds towards an energetic chorus full of electronic beats and distorted guitars. Meanwhile, ""Awaken"" features a more stripped-down approach with just a piano and Jane's mesmerizing vocals, allowing the song's emotional lyrics to shine.

As someone who is not typically a fan of nan music, I found myself pleasantly surprised by Companion's self-titled album. The band's commitment to creating a cohesive and captivating listening experience truly pays off. While the album is not without its flaws (some tracks feel like they could benefit from more instrumental variation), it's clear that Companion is a band worth paying attention to.

Overall, I would give Companion's self-titled album a solid 6.5 out of 10. While it may not be a perfect album, it's clear that Companion has poured their hearts and souls into the creation of this record. It's an album that grows on you with each listen, revealing new layers of depth and emotion. If you're a fan of indie music with a unique and introspective flair, then Companion's self-titled album is definitely worth checking out.","1.

Various Artists,1970's Algerian Proto-Raï Underground,,7.5,December 10 2008,Joshua Klein,,"There are any number of reasons why certain bands and singers fall into obscurity-- it's not always due to lack of impact, importance, or even something as practical as distribution. Sometimes they disappear because they're made to disappear. In the case of raï, Algeria's vibrant hybrid of Middle Eastern and European folk, its subject matter and party vibe often made the music a target in post-colonial Algeria, with former FLN fighter and later the nation's Marxist leader Houari Boumédienne not as huge a fan of free speech as he was of suppressing it. Of course, raï never vanished. Every bit the people's music as much as punk or hip-hop, raï had flourished for decades before the government brought the hammer down-- and even then it merely moved underground; it's from those years that Sublime Frequencies' vinyl-only 1970's Algerian Proto-Raï Underground compiles (thanks to Hicham Chadly) eight festive horn (and, in one case, electric guitar) adorned tracks from four Algerian acts. These rough hewn recordings sound like they were surreptitiously recorded at some wedding or street party, full as they are of pounding percussion, bleating brass, humming organ or accordion, and full-throated Arabic vocals. Translations of the titles reveal a quotidian truth to the songs: Bellemou & Benfissa's ""Li Maandouche L'Auto"", for example, translates roughly to ""He Who Doesn't Own a Car"" (it's about drunk driving, and features ""Father of Raï"" Messaoud Bellemou, whose L'Orchestre Bellemou updated many traditional Algerian melodies for modern ears). Boutaiba Sghir's ""Dayha Oulabes"" is perhaps more universally resonant as ""I'll Marry Her Whether They Like It or Not"", while Groupe El Azhar's ""Mazal Nesker Mazal"" becomes the remarkably descriptive ""I'm Still Getting Drunk...Still"". Cheb Zergui's ""Ana Dellali"" means, straightforwardly enough, ""I Cuddle Myself"". The late-70s track ""Ana Dellali"" is the most striking track on the comp, given its psychedelic wah-wah guitar and dub-wise bass. The rest of the set is more slice of life. Culled from long-forgotten 45s, this collection plays like a snapshot of what one imagines might have been found performed in cabarets or blaring in a some backroom Oran jukebox when the long arm of the law was looking the other way. Given the subsequent global spread of raï and the international success of several bona fide raï stars, archivists, DJs and treasure hunters would be wise to dispatch their best vinyl hounds to the city forthright, in search of more gems likes these, just waiting to be dusted off and discovered anew.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12487-1970s-algerian-proto-rai-underground/,Sublime Frequencies,2008.0,"Have you ever felt like rediscovering a whole new genre? Well, my friends, that's what listening to '1970's Algerian Proto-Raï Underground' felt like. This album, consisting of various artists, is a masterful compilation of raï music that was produced during a time when Algeria was just gaining independence. 

The inception of this album is intriguing as it pays tribute to an era in history when Algerian musicians were pushing the boundaries of the music industry, experimenting with different techniques and sounds. The music genre is nan, and the album is a fusion of different elements; from folk and traditional music to modern adaptations blended seamlessly together. Each song has a unique story behind it with diverse and moving lyrics and an astonishing variety of musical instruments that are both exotic and ear-catching. 

The album’s creation was no easy feat as the political climate in the country was in turmoil, and censorship was prevalent. While the artists faced barriers and obstacles of this nature, they soldiered on to produce music that speaks not only to their generation but also to ours. The songs take us on a vivid journey of the joys and troubles of life, showcasing the emotions that one can go through in our daily lives. 

Listening to this album, I felt a sense of cultural immersion that I’ve never quite experienced before. The beauty of it is that it gives off an essence of African mysticism while still presenting dance-worthy tunes that contemporary audiences will love. It’s a collection that one can lose themselves in while still creating an avenue for a sense of community as each song tells a story that resonates with us. 

On the whole, '1970's Algerian Proto-Raï Underground' is a brilliant piece of music that should be listened to and admired by all. It successfully merges traditional music with modern sounds and creates an appealing, toe-tapping sound wave that will have you comprehensively jamming along.

Tim Hecker,"Ravedeath, 1972",Experimental,8.6,February 18 2011,Joe Colly,Contributor,"There are plenty of synth and drone artists that make epic, transportive music, but one of the unique things about Tim Hecker is his conceptual ability. Each of his records, from the cinematic rush of Harmony in Ultraviolet to the dreamed-up cartography of An Imaginary Country, explores a specific theme, often in great detail. When he talked to us last month about the artwork for his latest LP, Ravedeath, 1972, Hecker mentioned that he'd been consumed with the idea of sonic decay. ""I became obsessed with digital garbage,"" he said. ""Like when the Kazakstan government cracks down on piracy and there's pictures of 10 million DVDs and CDRs being pushed by bulldozers."" That idea, the notion of music as a cheapened, battered object, touches nearly every aspect of Ravedeath, 1972, a dark and often claustrophobic record that is arguably Hecker's finest work to date. The album is based on a single day's worth of recordings in a church in Reykjavik, Iceland, where Hecker used a groaning pipe organ to lay down the foundation for its tracks. (Throughout, you can hear the vastness of this place, as sounds ricochet around, bounce off the rafters.) With help from Iceland-based producer Ben Frost-- whose ominous By the Throat is a touchstone here-- Hecker then finished the record in studio, digitally adding synth wash and wailing shoegaze crunch to his live recordings. The result is a strange hybrid that lives somewhere between the digital and material realms, and it's remarkable how seamlessly the two are combined. For example, in a track like ""In the Fog II"", it's difficult to distinguish between the organic church sounds and the processed ones that came after. But while there is harmony between the source material, Ravedeath, 1972 is by no means about prettiness or tranquility. Hecker pits noises against one another in such a way that creates a constant push and pull between discord and beauty. It's a bit like William Basinski's Disintegration Loops, but instead of music aging over time, this is far more combative-- like these songs are being attacked from the inside out. It's an unusual concept but relevant given the rate at which music is consumed and discarded these days. More important than the record's ideology, though, is what Hecker does with it-- the weight, atmosphere, and contrast he builds into these songs. Take for example the ""In the Fog"" suite, where over three tracks, Hecker lets dissonant squall threaten an undulating organ drone until it's taken over by wailing guitar noise in third passage. Or the two-part ""Hatred of Music"", which recalls an Oneohtrix Point Never synth shimmer before it disintegrates into distant industrial creaks. In each case it's not just about the wild, unearthly sounds he creates but the force with which they move around the mix. Hecker is also smart with pacing and knows when to dial things back or add in softer, interstitial numbers when things start to become overwhelming. That's the case in the record's back half where he uses open-ended pieces to achieve the same foreboding effect. ""Studio Suicide, 1980"" is almost dreamy but has a sinister undercurrent, sounding something like the more punishing moments of My Bloody Valentine's ""Only Shallow"" heard through the walls of a neighbor's apartment. I wouldn't go so far as to call songs like this and ""Analog Paralysis, 1978"", which has a similar celestial vibe, ""ambient,"" but they are subtler than those in the first half and give the album a sense of balance and a natural arc. If you buy into the concept of Ravedeath, 1972 as an examination of music threatened by technology, there are pretty clear threads that pop up over the course of the record to support that. For one, it seems that the organ sounds Hecker captured back in that Rejkjavik church represent a certain purity of sound and that the digital noise battering it throughout act as the enemy, the corrosive effect. There's an ongoing struggle between the two that's mirrored in the menacing song titles and gripping cover art. It's important, then, that the album closes with ""In the Air III"", a track that features almost no interference whatsoever, just the plinking organ by itself. If I'm reading it right, it feels like Hecker's point is that music, in its purest form, survives no matter what you throw at it.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15124-ravedeath-1972/,Kranky,2011.0,"Tim Hecker's 'Ravedeath, 1972' is a mesmerizing work of art that takes listeners on an unforgettable journey through the world of experimental music. With a rating of 8.6 out of 10, this album showcases the sheer brilliance of Hecker's unique musical style, which fuses together elements of electronic, drone, ambient, and classical music to create a sound that is both hauntingly beautiful and deeply immersive.

Hecker's journey in the music industry has been an eventful one. After graduating from McGill University's music program, he gained attention with his debut album 'Haunt Me, Haunt Me Do It Again' in 2001, and has since released several critically acclaimed albums, including 'Ravedeath, 1972.' The album was recorded in a church in Reykjavik, Iceland, where Hecker used the natural reverb of the church to create a unique soundscape that truly immerses listeners in the music.

'Ravedeath, 1972' is an album that cannot be pigeonholed into any specific genre. Its experimental sound showcases Hecker's immense creativity and boundary-pushing approach to music-making. As someone who is a fan of both electronic and classical music, I found this album to be a perfect marriage of these two genres. The use of electronic elements creates a sense of ethereal otherworldliness, while the classical instruments bring in a human element that grounds the music and makes it relatable.

One of the standout tracks on the album is 'Hatred Of Music I,' a haunting and eerie piece that utilizes the natural reverb of the church to create a sense of vastness and infinity. As the track progresses, the sound transforms into something akin to an industrial wasteland, with echoes of distorted sounds that add to the overall feeling of foreboding.

Another standout track is 'In The Fog III,' which takes listeners on a journey through a soundscape that is at once melancholic and hopeful. The use of the piano paired with electronic elements creates a sense of warmth and intimacy that provides a perfect contrast to the more abstract tracks on the album.

Overall, 'Ravedeath, 1972' is an album that requires active participation from listeners. It is not a background music type of album, but rather an immersive experience that demands attention and focus. Hecker's talent is in creating an atmosphere and soundscape that is both unique and mesmerizing. This album is a masterpiece of experimental music, and a must-listen for anyone who wants to explore the boundaries of what music can be.","1. Review A has more complex and detailed sentences.

Antwon,Heavy Hearted in Doldrums,Rap,7.3,May 6 2014,Zoe Camp,Contributor,"Even by the standards of alt-rap eccentrics, Antwon’s pretty damn protean: a former hardcore kid brought up on boom-bap and pop singers who’ll readily name his new favorite thrash bands after compiling a list of the best Cocteau Twins songs. The San Jose rapper’s unorthodox backstory easily situates him within the broader, border-crossing movement that, thanks to peers like Le1f, Big Baby Ghandi, and Cities Aviv, seeps steadily into hip- hop’s consciousness. “Post-internet” labels aside, it’s easy to see why his two most recent mix tapes, End of Earth and In Dark Denim, were received with enthusiasm: combining vaporwave synths, Death-Grips-style compression, and Biggie worship into a cohesive rap song is hard enough, and tougher still when sex jams are one of your main specialties. Somehow, Antwon pulled it off. On his new album, Heavy Hearted in Doldrums, the rapper constructs his boldest collection yet, grounded in improved production and his characteristic schoolboy wit. If the album’s mildly redundant title and its po-faced track list don’t make it clear enough, Antwon’s grown sulkier since we last saw him. From the shadowy posturing of “Cold Tears”—this album’s closest thing to a banger—to the molasses-thick, melancholic  “Don’t Care”, Heavy Hearted in Doldrums is often mired in sorrow. But the sadness is ultimately powerless before the rapper’s insatiable libido. In spite of his laments on “Loser” (“I used to have a heart/ It once was filled with love”), Antwon continues to approach sex with the bushy-tailed perspective of a teenager who’s just been handed his driver’s license. “She bust seven times, made a nigga feel great!” he crows on “Break Yo' Back”, a boast he supports throughout the album with his many, many references to oral sex. Wacky erotic banter remains his biggest strength, fueled by a warmhearted, sex-positive spirit that recalls fellow horn dog Danny Brown, or perhaps, a kinkier Biz Markie. Even when he’s being a creep (“As long as your Dad don’t care/ I’ma run my fingers through your baby hairs”) or indulging his bad habit of running a phrase like “bust in threes” into the ground, you’ve got to admire his originality, not to mention his gusto. At the very least, he’s leagues above the majority of his guests, whose contributions to this album range from tight (Lil Ugly Mane’s crossfaded musings on “Rain Song”) to irremediably tepid (Wiki’s shrill, stilted verse on ""No Metro Nome”). Heavy Hearted in Doldrums has been billed as Antwon’s first proper “album”, a distinction that translates into some much-needed upgrades in production. Most notably, there’s none of the dodgy mixing that rendered portions of In Dark Denim downright unlistenable. After the cramped sonics of the past, even the first few seconds of the Sean Kemp-produced, “Rain Song” feel overwhelming: a sudden onslaught of ambient nature sounds, cavernous chorals, and somber violins before the bongo beat comes creeping in. When Antwon finally comes in over the primal beat, his voice doesn’t have to fight for space, so even a stale hook like “She’s got me up all night doing that rain dance” gets a vital dose of immediacy. That’s not to say the mix is immaculate. It suffers from a serious dearth of bass, and frequently overemphasizes their weaker aspects, like the cheap synths that drive  “Mr. Intercontinental”. “KLF ELF”, the worst offender in this regard, includes a refreshingly ribald guest verse from Das Racist’s Heems that packs in a reference to Olivia Benson from “Law and Order: SVU”, but it’s hard to appreciate the rapper’s wit when he’s muffled by Pictureplane’s blaring calisthenics jams. Were this another run-of-the-mill mixtape, these flaws could easily be overlooked. But considering the fact that Heavy Hearted in Doldrums was funded by a clothing company that charges upwards of 50 bucks for a faux-distressed t-shirt, one would think there’d be fewer duds. Last summer, Antwon crossed paths with Deafheaven guitarist Kerry McCoy for a washed-out remix of In Dark Denim’s title track, hinting at a possible new scheme through which his two selves, Crusthead and Biz Markie .gif incarnate, could be joined in anguish. Instead of putting these new configurations to the test, Heavy Hearted in Doldrums tinkers with the made-in-the-‘90s blueprint he’s been using from the start, with solid and safe results. That framework suits the rapper just fine, but listening to this album, you can’t help but wish for his dirty genius to fester into something fiercer.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19262-antwon-heavy-hearted-in-doldrums/,Aesop,2014.0,"Antwon's latest release, ""Heavy Hearted in Doldrums,"" is an introspective journey through the rap genre that showcases the versatility and depth of this artist's sound. With a rating of 7.3 out of 10, this album is a noteworthy addition to Antwon's already impressive body of work.

Antwon, known for his unique style and introspective lyrics, has been in the rap game for several years now. His music explores themes of love, anguish, and addiction, and this album is no different. The creation story of ""Heavy Hearted in Doldrums"" is just as fascinating as the music itself.

According to Antwon, the album was inspired by a dark period in his life where he felt trapped by his own thoughts and emotions. He wanted to create music that would reflect this feeling of helplessness, while also offering hope to those who may be going through similar experiences. The album was recorded over a period of two years, with Antwon writing and producing each track himself.

From the opening track, ""Corrosive,"" listeners are immediately immersed in Antwon's world of emotional strife. The haunting instrumental, paired with Antwon's introspective lyrics, sets the tone for the rest of the album. The second track, ""Intolerant,"" picks up the pace a bit with a more upbeat instrumental, yet Antwon's lyrics remain just as raw and emotive.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Sundress."" This track takes a lighter approach and offers listeners some relief from the heavier themes of the album. The instrumental is bright and melodic, and Antwon's lyrics about a love interest are both playful and vulnerable.

All in all, ""Heavy Hearted in Doldrums"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged journey through the mind of a talented artist. Antwon's introspective lyrics and haunting instrumentals are sure to resonate with listeners who have experienced similar struggles in their own lives. At a rating of 7.3 out of 10, this album is a worthy addition to any rap fan's collection.","1.

Jay Som,Everybody Works,Rock,8.6,March 10 2017,Judy Berman,Contributor,"Virtuous though it may be, patience is a difficult quality to capture in guitar rock, a medium that much prefers boldness, concision, and urgency. Perhaps that’s why Bay Area multi-instrumentalist Melina Duterte’s reverence for the human capacity to wait and think and grow comes across as a revelation on Everybody Works, her first official album as Jay Som. “Take time to figure it out,” she advises on lead single “The Bus Song.” In its context, she’s caught between relationship statuses, assuring the object of her fixation that she’ll “be the one who sticks around.” As an introduction to an album full of reminders not to rush things, though, the line is a relief, enough to make you involuntarily exhale. Bedroom pop is a genre designation that loses meaning by the year—not just as technology creeps closer to erasing any distinction between studio production and home recording, but also as the musicians associated with it develop tastes more varied and less retro than, say, Ariel Pink’s. Twenty-two-year-old Duterte made the fuzzy, dreamy, plaintive aesthetic her own on Turn Into, nine self-recorded tracks she uploaded to Bandcamp on a tipsy whim over a year ago and re-released with Polyvinyl in late 2016, billing the makeshift debut as a collection of “finished and unfinished songs” rather than a proper album. Although she made *Everybody Works *alone in her bedroom studio, its repertoire ranges from folk to funk to chart pop. It’s not a bedroom-pop album because it sounds a certain way, but because it feels so intimate. Most of Duterte’s elaborate songs could be mistaken for full-band compositions, yet her preference for writing and recording in solitude imbues each one with an introspective quality. Liberated from the obligation to conform to any one sound, Duterte investigates new styles with purpose. She’s smitten with Carly Rae Jepsen’s E•MO•TION, and it shows in the hooky choruses of “The Bus Song” and “Remain,” two tracks steeped in exuberant longing. With its smooth keyboards and slinky bass line, “Baybee” comes on like an R&B slow jam, but instead of steaming up the windows, it’s about seducing yourself into seeing your beloved through a rough patch: “If I leave you alone/When you don’t feel right/I know we’ll sink for sure,” Duterte coos on top of the music, like a layer of pure calm. “1 Billion Dogs” submerges anxious lyrics in a cloud of feedback that melds shoegaze, indie pop, and grunge as if it were a forgotten gem from the *DGC Rarities *compilation. But the most arresting songs are the ones that defy categorization entirely. The first minute of the album, on “Lipstick Stains,” sounds the way orchestra instruments might upon waking from an afternoon nap, blinking and stretching in the sunlight. When the vocals kick in more than halfway through the track, Duterte’s murmur is just as drowsily blissful: “I like the way your lipstick stains/The corner of my smile,” she breathes. Everybody Works closes with “For Light,” an epic, seven-minute ballad that transforms a whispered promise—“I’ll be right on time/Open blinds for light/Won’t forget to climb”—into a sing-along prayer by adding in the voices of backup singers. The mood of weary resilience is reminiscent of Nick Cave’s “Push the Sky Away,” another album-closing message of encouragement that fully acknowledges the herculean effort it takes, sometimes, to merely keep going. As that comparison suggests, Duterte has absorbed more of life’s hard lessons than most of us do by age 22. The patience that suffuses *Everybody Works *doesn’t reflect the naïveté of a kid who’s sure she has unlimited time to chase her ambitions and find love; it comes out of an emotionally mature view of relationships and the 10 years of work she has already put into her songwriting, taking shitty jobs and enduring family strife to become the musician she is today. “I’ll remain under your moon,” she pledges on “Remain,” an anthem of (perhaps one-sided) commitment. “Everybody Works” registers Duterte’s resentment at how easily success seems to come to the “rock star” who make her wonder, “Did you pay your way through?” But empathy wins out in the end; she makes “everybody works” a mantra, repeating the phrase as though to remind herself of the way other people’s painstaking efforts can be invisible to us. “All of my songs are so different, but you know it’s me,” Duterte remarked in a recent Pitchfork profile. She’s right, and there’s no better indicator that a songwriter has found her voice than the ability to explore new styles and still sound like the same artist. Just a few years into her adult life, and only one album into her recording career, Melina Duterte has swept past a milestone many musicians never even get in their sights.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22982-everybody-works/,"Polyvinyl,Double Denim",2017.0,"Jay Som's ""Everybody Works"" is a beautifully crafted rock album that showcases the band's impressive musicianship and songwriting skills. From start to finish, the album captures the essence of what it means to be a lover of contemporary rock music.

When looking at the history of Jay Som, it is incredible to see how far the band has come in such a short amount of time. The solo project of Melina Duterte, Jay Som gained recognition through the release of her debut album in 2017, and it's been a steady upward trend for the band since then. Jay Som's unique blend of rock, indie, and dream pop elements has attracted fans from all over the world, and their new album continues to prove why they are such a big deal.

""Everybody Works"" was created in a more collaborative way than Jay Som's previous albums, which allowed the band members to put their own spin on the tracks. This new approach to songwriting allowed for experimentation, and the end result is a beautifully crafted album that feels both cohesive and diverse.

What sets this album apart from others in the genre is the attention given to crafting each track. From the opening track ""Lipstick Stains"" to the final notes of ""For Light,"" each song is meticulously crafted with thoughtful lyrics, intricate melodies, and powerful instrumentation. Duterte's vocals are particularly noteworthy, and they are both haunting and effortlessly beautiful.

Personally, I found myself drawn to tracks like ""Remain,"" which has a driving, almost hypnotic quality to it, and ""The Bus Song,"" which is a more stripped-down, emotional ballad that showcases Duterte's vocal range. The album as a whole is a perfect blend of emotional vulnerability and raw energy, and it's hands down one of the best rock albums I've heard in recent years.

Overall, Jay Som's ""Everybody Works"" is a masterful indie rock album that showcases the band's immense talent and passion for music. For fans of the genre, this album is an instant classic, and for newcomers to the band, it's the perfect introduction to the world of Jay Som. It's an album that is meant to be listened to from start to finish, and it's definitely worth adding to any music lover's collection. I'd give it an 8.6 out of 10, and it's definitely one of my favorite albums of the year.","1.

Duster,Contemporary Movement,Rock,8.4,August 22 2000,Mark Richard-San,,"There's something oddly comforting about the fact that Carl Sagan was a stoner. When young and in the throes of psychedelic experience, the mind automatically focuses on the heavens, wondering if it is really possible that, like, dude, check it: what if there's a whole universe like the one out there inside of a single blackhead? Sagan had this same experience at some point and ran with it; next thing you know, he's loading albums onto the Voyager probes for distant civilizations to rock to. (Fact: the Voyager probes, which will continue to move in a line away from Earth for the next 40,000 years, were outfitted with gold-plated turntables and records cut with sounds from Earth. Among the sounds are Chuck Berry's ""Maybelene"" and a greeting from Jimmy Carter. Sagan selected the tunes, making him by far the most out-there DJ of the pre-remix era.) Whatever powered Sagan's imagination, it should serve as inspiration for us all. Like the Voyager probes, San Jose's Duster has been known to travel the spaceways. It's unclear if the root of it all lies in astronomy or neurology, and maybe it was just the song titles (""Moon Age,"" ""Constellations,"" ""Docking the Pod"") or the Cold War-era reverb on the guitars, but Duster's first album evoked a slow, drifting journey through the void-- one to be taken in either a space capsule or a plush four-poster canopy bed. Contemporary Movement is something a little bit different. While the band sees this as the album where they shed some excess guitar layering, move the vocals up in the mix, and focus on the songs, the sound here isn't all that different. True, there's nothing here nearly as abstract as the buzzing drone construction that was Stratosphere's title track, but Duster still has a way with the slow tempo and the beautifully distorted guitar noise. And from the first washed-out strum on ""Operations,"" it's clearly Duster all the way. No, the major change on this album is in bringing the thematic focus back to earth, over the mountains, through the city, and into the bedroom. Continuing a trend they began on their 1975 EP, Duster show some vulnerability and refuse to mask feelings in cosmic metaphor. For contrast, Duster's first 7"" single, Transmission/Flux, featured a sad, dreamy song that repeated the refrain ""all my friends are cosmonauts""; Contemporary Movement has a song that says, ""Goddamn, I wish I was a little bit smarter"" (on ""Contemporary Breakups""). In the titles and lyrics, these are intimate songs about real emotion. What carries these fragile (and easily mocked) sentiments across is the absolutely fucking gorgeous guitar music they're riding on. Ewing Parton and Canaan Amber (Duster's co-leaders) are wonderful musicians, though I doubt they could play with any real speed or dexterity, even if they wanted to. Their skill lies in finding the perfect guitar to go with just the right amp, so that the sound coming out of the speaker bears all the prickly warmth of your favorite wool sweater-- a tone so detailed you want to rub it between your fingers. Parton and Amber can only sing three notes between them (and sometimes they miss one), so the melodies here have to be simple. This apparent limitation gives the melancholy tunes on Contemporary Movement a haiku-like clarity, and leaves plenty of gaps for the lovely chords to seep through. Aware of delicate humanity with their eyes trained on the stars, Duster has done Carl proud.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2493-contemporary-movement/,"Up,Up",,"If you're a fan of indie rock, you've likely heard of Duster--and if you haven't, well, ""Contemporary Movement"" is a fantastic introduction to the band's unique sound.

For those who aren't familiar, Duster formed in San Jose, California in the late 90s. The trio consists of multi-instrumentalists Clay Parton, Jason Albertini, and Canaan Dove Amber. For years, they were known for their lo-fi, experimental sound and their ability to evoke a sense of dreaminess and introspection in their listeners.

""Contemporary Movement"" was released in 2020, marking the band's first album in 19 years. As someone who was eagerly awaiting its release, I can say that it was definitely worth the wait. The album is a beautiful continuation of the band's legacy, showcasing their ability to create intricate, atmospheric rock music.

From the beginning, ""Contemporary Movement"" feels like a journey--each song flows seamlessly into the next, creating a cohesive listening experience. Fans of Duster's earlier work will recognize their signature sound, but will also notice subtle advancements in their approach. The album's production is cleaner than their earlier releases, giving more space for the instruments and vocals to breathe.

The album's opening track, ""I'm Lost"", is an excellent introduction to what's to come. It's a minimalist track, built around a steady drumbeat and a repeating guitar riff. The lyrics are simple yet evocative, with lines like ""All I remember are the things I forget"". The real magic of the song comes during the bridge, when a warm wave of synths washes over everything.

Other standout tracks include ""Letting Go"", a beautiful slow-burner that builds to a cathartic climax, and ""Hoya Paranoia"", which features some of the band's catchiest melodies and most upbeat instrumentation.

As a longtime fan of Duster, I was thrilled to hear ""Contemporary Movement"". It feels like a natural progression for the band, and I truly believe it's one of their best works to date. I highly recommend giving it a listen--you won't be disappointed.","1. Review A has a more unconventional structure, with the writer meandering between different thoughts and topics.

Nocturnal Poisoning,Doomgrass,,3.0,October 8 2014,Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,"For a musician who first staked his entire reputation on the shadows provided by pseudonyms, Scott Conner is suddenly and certainly full of braggadocio. He spent 15 years hidden behind nested aliases: he was Malefic, or the sole member of the one-man black metal mystery Xasthur, and a one-time contributor to Twilight. But Xasthur released its last record, the divisive Portal of Sorrow, in 2010, and Conner has since shed not just the corpse-painted nicknames but also the shield of distorted electric guitars, primitive drums, and hissing electronics that defined that band. Now, credited under his own name (or, at the very least, “Scott C.”), he records thin, sullen acoustic music as Nocturnal Poisoning. In liner note selfies, he is clean-shaven and makeup-free. In interviews, he is confident not only about his decision to leave black metal behind but also his technical progression as a fingerpicking summoner of the blues, bluegrass, and country. “Nocturnal Poisoning is actually more technical than Xasthur was,” he said in a recent chat with Noisey. “It’s just more mellow and doesn’t have any of my mediocre drumming.” To that end, he titled the third Nocturnal Poisoning album in three years Doomgrass, an illustrative portmanteau of doom metal and bluegrass. The creation and naming of a new genre from whole cloth? That’s a pretty heavy burden to wrap around the neck of any project, especially the first album not to be self-released in a very limited edition. But Conner, who climbed inside a coffin to sing for Sunn O))) a decade ago, has never been one for soft statements. But the results are embarrassing. Doomgrass is an interminable 14-track slog through inconsequential guitar instrumentals and croaked-and-groaned high-school diary entries, laughably sung by Nocturnal Poisoning’s only collaborator to date, Robert Nesslin. The previous Nocturnal Poisoning albums have been mostly inoffensive affairs of acoustic strum-alongs, backed by modest percussion, mild effects and Nesslin’s occasional vocal contributions. As he’d been with Xasthur, Conner seemed comfortable with a defiant sort of primitivism, where the music’s cumulative effect and feeling mattered much more than the compositional acumen. Doomgrass would be difficult to appreciate just as a neofolk record, or even as a continuation of Death in June’s own shambling acoustic misery. Conner, though, is in the uncomfortable position of trying to pass off looped and delayed guitars as bona fide technical merit in two fields where skill can be difficult to fake. His “licks” are little more than a patchwork pastiche of sputtering arpeggios and bent strings, dispatched with the kind of lightweight tone that suggests a college freshman learning the tablature to “Dancing Nancies” on a used Ovation. “Vagrant, Seeker of Empty Treasures” vaguely recalls Doc Watson’s heavy thumb and swift fingers, “Bet It All” the quick progressions of Clarence White. But there are entire skills absent from Conner’s set, and they limit him to the insulting side of passable. Doomgrass suggests a translation where the interpreter, though cocksure, knows one language well but only has a rudimentary grasp of the second tongue. If that sounds rough, wait until you hear the words, and the way they’re sung. Conner wrote these lyrics, which amount to little more than dire reflections scribbled in the back of a notebook during a lunch break. There are misery clichés galore—“Roses you never smell,” “Become yesterday’s news,” and so on—and the prevailing sense that Conner has been too busy learning how to complain about life to live. He trades the experiential focus of the folk music he appropriates for empty lines about no money and dirty cities. Nesslin does his best to give the words the gravitas they demand, but his strained, dark-blues croon is mostly funny, as if he’s moaning these tunes from a toilet stall. Above the trebly guitar and light percussion of “Can’t Find the Sky,” he sings, “Life is a phase and a failed test/ Wait for God to clean up the mess,” doubling his voice so as to sound doubly mean. Try not to giggle. Bluegrass, blues, and old-time music, like most all other folk arts in the world, can sometimes suffer assumptions that, simply because they’re old, they’re quaint and genteel. That is, we tend to teach our children Mother Maybelle Carter’s big-time version of “Keep on the Sunny Side” rather than the apocalyptic meltdown of “When the World’s on Fire”, which she sang long before with her parents. But that view is a bleached and sterilized reality, of course, one that doesn’t recognize the way that this music has long worked as an anchor in times of crisis. Bluegrass and folk music at large are nothing if not full of doom—hell, “Rank Strangers,” the standard of the bluegrass gospel canon, essentially suggests that, if you leave home for too long, everyone you know will be dead (or at least gone) when you return. So every antediluvian form that Conner tries to wrangle for his woe has a well-established pedigree of melancholy, but he seems to have missed that memo. That alone is not a reason to discount Conner’s attempt to weld doom metal to folk, but it’s certainly a reason to hope he could have as much deference for one side of that equation as he seems to have for the other. And maybe Conner will get there, since he seems newly devoted to practice, perfection, and building his repertoire piecemeal. Perhaps in a decade, Doomgrass will be a foundation for something that actually deserves to be called that. But for now, it’s hard not to hear these songs of self-pity and wish that, like a rank stranger, Xasthur would simply slip back into the shadows.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19800-nocturnal-poisoning-doomgrass/,The End,2014.0,"Nocturnal Poisoning's ""Doomgrass"" is a curious venture into the realm of nan music. At first listen, it may be difficult to discern where the album is headed, but after a few listens, it begins to reveal itself as an artful and experimental take on traditional bluegrass music. 

To understand ""Doomgrass,"" it's essential to know the history of the man behind Nocturnal Poisoning - Scott Conner. Conner has been active in the underground metal scene for over two decades, and his contributions to the genre's expansive soundscapes are undeniable. However, in recent years, Conner has shifted his focus to exploring different musical styles, and ""Doomgrass"" is the result of that experiment.

The album was recorded in the basement of Conner's home, which allowed him to take his time and experiment freely. The length of time it took to record is evident in the album's overall sound. It's a raw, intimate, and hauntingly beautiful work of art. 

At first glance, the rating of 3.0 out of 10 may discourage some listeners from giving ""Doomgrass"" a chance. However, to dismiss the album based on that number alone would do it a disservice. There is undoubtedly something unique and captivating about ""Doomgrass,"" and while it may not be for everyone, it's worth giving it a chance.

Personally, the album resonated with me on a profound level. The themes of loss and sorrow in tracks like ""Stars"" and ""In Solitude"" hit me on an emotional level, and the unorthodox instrumentation added a layer of intrigue that kept me coming back for more. 

In conclusion, ""Doomgrass"" may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a carefully crafted work of art that deserves to be appreciated. Nocturnal Poisoning has taken a risk with this album, and it's a gamble that has paid off in its own unique way.","1.

Badly Drawn Boy,One Plus One Is One,Rock,3.0,July 21 2004,Sam Ubl,,"You need not have your head buried too deeply in your iBook to catch a whiff of bias against Nick Hornby from the independent music press. The balding, perpetually thirtysomething pop novelist has lately been trying his hand at rock commentary (a passion second only to soccer-- er, football), crafting articles for The New York Times and The Believer, editing a popular critical anthology (Da Capo's annual Best Music Writing series), and even publishing an homage to his 31 favorite songs, titled, appropriately enough, 31 Songs. Like it or not, Hornby is a relevant cultural figure who has used his clout as a novelist to help develop an ancillary career in music journalism. Though his work in the field is certainly passionate, Hornby is undoubtedly a novelist first and a critic second. The backlash, then, is understandable, when he exhausts 2,000 words on sentimental lauding over uneven Philadelphia schlock-rockers Marah, or incessantly pontificates about his bygone youth and its tenuous-at-best connection to music. It seems wherever the man lays his pen, it serves as a clarion call for the press to root against his new favorite band. The task for fans becomes deciding if, in fact, the death knell is warranted. Witness: Damon Gough. Gough is an artist who has been handily and, some may argue, unfairly smote by Hornby's approbation. After hearing his wonderfully enigmatic debut, 2000's The Hour of Bewilderbeast, Hornby was smitten, and asked the Badly Drawn Boy to score the big-screen adaptation of his About a Boy. Both film and score, however, were met with equal parts acclaim and enmity, leaving Gough's standing in flux. While many insist the entrapments of commercial success (About a Boy, a contract with ArtistDirect BMG) have led Gough down an ill-fated path toward mainstream banality, I've willingly given him the benefit of the doubt. A gleeful champion of Bewilderbeast, I've been searching for some hard evidence-- any evidence-- with which to refute Gough's intensely biased detractors. I concede that, since his wily debut, the threadbare Briton hasn't crafted anything approaching the idiosyncrasy and charming verve of Bewilderbeast. But while the flaccid one-two punch of About a Boy and Have You Fed the Fish? festered in light of his momentous debut, those lackluster efforts surely weren't so awful as to rule out a potential return to form... were they? Well, it's beginning to look that way. Back with a new label (Astralwerks), and a shot at a new beginning, One Plus One Is One finds Gough accelerating his concerted drive toward commercial success, and the results only offer more fodder for the fallen auteur's ruthless gadflies. There's nary a strong song here-- not even a retread of ""Silent Sigh"" or ""Something to Talk About"", much less another ""Once Around the Block"" or ""Everybody's Stalking"". Sadly, Gough has firmly and perhaps inevitably cleared, as ex-PFM writer Jesse Fahnestock put it, the ""fenceline between execrable REO Speedwagon pomp-pop and touching, emotive songwriting,"" and landed on, well, you can guess which side. The troubling thing about Gough's undoing is that it hasn't come in the form of a mere stasis, but rather a willful regression to a by-the-numbers approach to songwriting, devoid of pretty much any substance. On top of being simplistic, sonically unadventurous, and poorly recorded, these songs aren't the slightest bit catchy, a consequence of Gough attempting to balance his dour, nine-o'clock-shadow persona with FM radio aspirations. The album's most immediately memorable aspect is its indiscreet prologue and epilogue: a pointless sample of what sounds like shopping carts being jostled in a supermarket, only without the telltale ch-ching of cash registers. Gone are the sultry orch-pop orchestrations that characterized his debut and parts of the spotty Fed the Fish, replaced by a more pared-down palette of maudlin grand piano, close mic'd drums, plenty of indiscriminate strumming, and, for good measure, some new-age flute. Even Gough's trademark demure croon seems oddly self-conscious, doubtless a result of his voice sticking further out than usual from the tepid instrumental mix. Points of interest are few and far between. With their staid textures, the songs tend to blend into one another, sounding at best like a spiritless hodgepodge of About a Boy's weaker moments. The title track opener features a smattering of glockenspiel, trumpet, and overwrought strings, but the parts fail to coagulate, and the finished orchestration sounds like a bush league Fleetwood Mac. Elsewhere, Gough's lyrics are regrettably schmaltzy, as on ""Year of the Rat"" he croons (with some help from a completely unironic children's choir), ""Everybody needs to know it's the year of the rat/ Everyday we've got to hold on/ 'Cause if we hold on, we could find some new energy."" Elsewhere, ""Summertime in Wintertime"" feebly acknowledges Jethro Tull, juxtaposing a bouncy flute against a generic prog riff. In context, it's something of a tour de force number for Gough, but ultimately a stone better left unturned on an album best left unheard.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/529-one-plus-one-is-one/,Astralwerks,2004.0,"As an avid music listener and critic, I was recently introduced to the album ""One Plus One Is One"" by Badly Drawn Boy. With a rating of 3.0 out of 10 in the rock genre, I must admit that I was initially hesitant to give it a listen. However, after diving into the album headfirst, I found myself pleasantly surprised.

Before delving into the gritty details of the album itself, it is important to understand a bit about the band and their history. Badly Drawn Boy is the one-man project of Damon Gough, a singer-songwriter hailing from the UK. Gough initially gained popularity with the release of his debut album, ""The Hour of Bewilderbeast,"" in 2000. The album earned him nominations for several prestigious music awards and put him on the map as one of the UK's most promising new artists.

Fast-forwarding to 2004, Gough released ""One Plus One Is One."" The album was his fourth studio release and was born out of a tumultuous yet creatively fertile period in the artist's life. Gough has said that he was dealing with a lot of personal issues during the time he was creating the album, including the death of his father and the dissolution of his relationship. This heartache is evident throughout the album's 12 tracks, which are introspective and melancholic yet still manage to maintain an air of hopefulness.

As someone who personally gravitates toward heavier rock and metal music, ""One Plus One Is One"" initially struck me as being on the slower side. However, as I began to immerse myself in Gough's lyrics and melodies, I found myself drawn in by the emotionally complex nature of his work. The opening track, ""One Plus One Is One,"" sets the tone for the album with its bittersweet message of having to navigate life's challenges alone. This theme is carried throughout the album, particularly in standout tracks like ""Another Devil Dies"" and ""This Is That New Song.""

Gough's vocal stylings are, perhaps, an acquired taste for some. His voice is raw and unpolished, which lends itself well to the emotional weight of the material. However, for those who prefer their singers to have a bit more finesse, his delivery may come off as a bit sloppy. Nevertheless, the musicianship on ""One Plus One Is One"" is top-notch, particularly on tracks like ""The Blossoms"" and ""Without a Kiss.""

In conclusion, while ""One Plus One Is One"" may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is an album that deserves recognition for its depth and nuance. Gough's personal struggles are palpable throughout the record, making it a powerful and cathartic listening experience. The rock genre may not be the most obvious fit for the type of work that is presented here, but it is a testament to Gough's versatility as a musician and artist that he is able to mold it to his creative will. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who is looking for something a bit different from their typical rock fare.","1. Review A has a more complex structure and vocabulary.

Amazing Baby,Rewild,Rock,6.1,July 28 2009,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Coming straight out of Wesleyan to score a ton of SXSW buzz, bro-ing down with MGMT, getting breathless future-of-the-scene press from Interview and Rolling Stone and The Guardian, strutting around in 1971 cosplay while rolling their eyes at journalists who try to connect their hippie chic with actual usage of psychotropic substances-- there are plenty of reasons for skeptics to violently reject Amazing Baby. Granted, they're not particularly useful reasons, what with them having more to do with scenester anxiety and cred wars than anything, but they're floating around right now and muddling up the discourse. Fortunately, they have an album out now, which means that extrapolating judgments from little more than a 7"", an EP, and the dreaded Williamsburg address is no longer necessary. And here's a shock: Rewild isn't brought down by irony or posing or whatever it is about trust funds and/or beards that's supposed to make music shitty-- it's just a really scattershot debut, albeit a frequently entertaining one. Amazing Baby seem to be at the point in their young career where they're a short distance away from transitioning out of the traditional ""riffing off bands we like"" phase, and while there's a healthy eclecticism to their nebulous classic rock affectations, they do a better job at creating interesting variations of known quantities than transcending them. Opener ""Bayonets"" features a more muscular take on ELO's baroque, string-driven prog-pop, ""Invisible Palace"" towers like Pink Floyd's ""Astronomy Domine"" reproduced in neon and buffed to a metal-flake shine, ""The Narwhal"" is an amped-up, bongo-driven echo of Led Zeppelin's ""The Battle of Evermore"", and ""Dead Light"" and ""Headdress"" are perforated with glimmering shards of T. Rex. Still, it's a sign of hope that their stuff's hooky enough to transcend their semi-obvious source material, and combining early-70s rock histrionics with glossy post-electro party-rock wildness is a promising formula. But to get past the decent-pastiche stage, they still need a little work in the identity department. Frontman Will Roan has a voice that can't stick to a single memorable template, so he shades towards Marc Bolan astral swagger one moment and Donovan pastoralism the next. The single most consistent thing about his voice is how dazed and mumbly it sounds, which is either an asset or a detriment depending on how far towards dope-haze swooning any given song skews; he sounds effortlessly majestic in the gauzy slog of ""Pump Yr Brakes"" but smothered and lagging beneath the energetic uptempo charge of ""Kankra"". Simon O'Connor, guitarist and the other half of the band's core founding duo, has a broader problem: he drowns his instrument in so much arena-sized production glop it can be hard to tell what he's got going on stylistically beneath it all, though when he breaks out-- like he does in the squalling solos during ""Smoke Bros"" or ""Pump Yr Brakes""-- it's a pretty good jolt. (And since he played in Stylofone, who put out the great Thin Lizzy-toned riff-fest single ""Nighttime"" two and a half years ago, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.) This wall-of-gunk approach extends across the rest of the band, to the point where there's not a lot of breathing space; compare their Daytrotter sessions or the version of ""Headdress"" from their Infinite Fucking Cross EP to the overproduced re-recordings here and you'll hear what a subtler mix could do for these guys. That lack of breathing space, combined with Roan's mumbly-Joe tendencies, does obscure the hell out of the lyrics, which is a mixed blessing; Roan admitted to Rolling Stone that ""our lyrics are totally ridiculous sometimes,"" and it is at least to his credit he recognizes this. I'm not sure if that makes it more or less difficult to forgive ""Bayonets"" for using the phrase ""the kids are all right"" as part of its chorus, or ""Smoke Bros"" for its baffling refrain, ""We are starving cannibals/ She protects her animals."" I suppose when your closest lyrical analogue on the album's most memorable sing-along/chant-along line is Total Coelo, you risk alienating some people. But that's the kind of turf that can come with the feeling-out process, and there's enough lyrics that aren't goofy, uninspiring, or just plain illegible to make up for the ones that are. Unfortunately, the post-Web 2.0 hype cycle doesn't have time for growing pains; their reactionary approach tends to be enthusiastic first, then disappointed. Speaking as someone who would prefer to see the opposite happen-- letting bands dick around and get mediocrity out of their system before hitting on the inspiration that makes them worth following-- Rewild is how an average debut album should pan out. It might outstrip its ambition and wear its influences too blatantly, but Amazing Baby could be something special once it all clicks.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13286-rewild/,"V2,Shangri-La Music",2009.0,"If you're looking to take a ride on the wild side, the new album ""Rewild"" from Amazing Baby is definitely worth a listen. Their particular brand of rock, while not necessarily revolutionary in its execution, has a certain energy that makes it stand out from the crowd.

Before we dive into the album itself, let's take a moment to discuss Amazing Baby as a band. The group formed back in 2008 in Brooklyn, and quickly became one to watch after their debut EP ""Infinite Fucking Cross"" garnered some attention from music critics. Led by singer/guitarist Will Roan, the band has undergone some lineup changes over the years but has managed to maintain a consistent level of quality in their releases.

""Rewild"" was recorded over the course of several years, with some tracks dating back to as early as 2012. This lack of urgency to put out a new album can often result in a more refined, cohesive work, and that's certainly the case here. The songs on ""Rewild"" flow together seamlessly, creating a listening experience that feels like a journey rather than a collection of singles.

One standout track is ""The Narwhal"" which features Roan's raspy vocals over a driving guitar riff. It's a perfect example of the type of crunchy, riff-heavy rock that Amazing Baby excels at. ""The Narwhal"" is also notable for its lyrics, which center around a relationship gone sour but do so in a way that avoids the cliches often associated with the topic.

On the slower side of things, ""Deserter"" is a haunting ballad that showcases Roan's vocal range. The sparse instrumentation allows his voice to really shine, giving the listener a glimpse into the emotional depth of the lyrics. It's a gut-punch of a song, and one that lingers long after the album has ended.

Of course, not every song on ""Rewild"" hits the mark. ""Dead Light"" feels overlong and repetitive, while ""White Dress"" is a bit too derivative of earlier rock ballads. But even the weakest tracks are saved by the band's undeniable energy and charisma.

Overall, ""Rewild"" isn't going to change the face of rock music. But it's a solid addition to the genre, and a testament to the staying power of guitar-based rock. This album demonstrates that Amazing Baby is a band that knows what they do best, and they do it with aplomb. At a 6.1 rating out of 10, I would wholeheartedly recommend this album to anyone looking for a fresh take on classic rock.","1.

Meek Mill,DC4,Rap,6.9,November 2 2016,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,Contributor,"Since his last major-label release, 2015’s Dreams Worth More Than Money**, Meek Mill has been anything but silent. He put out a two-part EP (4/4), and fired up an assortment of beefs with Drake, the Game, Joe Budden, and 50 Cent. The largest course, of course, was with Drake, a Mean Girls meme-war that left Meek’s credibility so pummeled that fast-food chains felt safe enough to roast him. Even his MMG Boss Rick Ross distanced himself from his once proud protege (“I never took an L back when Meek fell…”). If nothing else, his next LP would be his best chance to define the next chapter in his story. But that LP, DC4, inspires more questions than answers. It’s ostensibly a mixtape, but it’s for sale on iTunes, suggesting the samples were cleared. Conceptually, it’s the fourth in his Dreamchasers series, a concept that defines both his side ventures and his identity. Meek’s struggle is quintessentially American. With the deck stacked against him from day one, his American Dream was laser-focused on climbing out of the South Philadelphia ghetto that claimed his father’s life. His Philly heroes in the State Property crew rapped as tough as they looked, and his hip-hop education played out on street corners He brings that energy to every one of his songs, and DC4 is no different. Taking a cue from Nas & Puffy, he starts off with nothing less dramatic than the “O Fortuna”-sampling “On the Regular,” produced by Lex Luger protege MP808. The opening bars serve as a prologue for the rest of the record, listing the things he will rap about: selling dope, going to court, wearing jewelry, drinking alcohol, having sex, smoking high-quality marijuana. Or as he puts it, “Stickin’ to the basics.” And if there’s a knock on Meek, it’s just that—he’s basic. Struggle rappers are constantly underestimated, dropping countless releases, scrapping for every ounce of recognition they can get. After more than a dozen releases, Meek Mill is really just a struggle rapper that made it. If he started from the bottom, now that he’s here, what else does he have to say? Not much, it turns out. Meek’s beat selection has always been impressive, especially considering his prolific output. And DC4 may have benefitted further from the relatively delayed release; The track list is loaded from top to bottom with bangers from young producers such as Sound M.O.B. (“Litty”) and the 808 Mafia. The features are a good indication of the sound he’s adopted, with guest appearances from Lil Uzi Vert, Young Thug, 21 Savage, and Migos’ Quavo. He takes a welcome left turn with the blues-guitar driven “Blue Notes,” built off a Snowy White sample, and puts on up-and-coming R&B crooner Guordan Banks with the Pusha T-featuring “Two Wrongs.” But when it comes to his rhymes, there’s little variety in his style. No matter the tone or mood of the beat he’s rhyming over, his rhymes are yelled rather than rapped. He’s 2016’s version of Bad Boy’s “Madd Rapper”—mad cuz he’s not getting enough “Shine,” mad cuz he didn’t get a tweet from the game’s biggest star. His energy at shows, honed from years of street-corner battles, is infectious. But on record, with his volume always cranked to 10, it really only works in small doses. And while he’s capable of detail-rich narratives, he never manages to focus on any one thought long enough to say anything of substance. Even the serial story of “Tony Story 3” is mired in hoary gangsta tropes. On DC4, Meek Mill is caught between his old life and his new one. His history with actual “gangsta shit” may have boosted his credibility—and profile—but now, it seems to be holding him back. He’s still prone to the occasional exhibition of garden-variety homophobia, but at least since he’s been in a relationship with Nicki Minaj, there’s been a noticeable reduction in misogyny. He almost certainly would love to graduate from his tough-guy street persona, but it’s as if he feels his core audience won’t let him. “You can't be hard all the time, man,” he told Billboard in an interview last year. “There's both sides to everything. What's wrong with it? Jay Z was a street rapper and he had a girlfriend.” He’s clearly thinking about how these pieces of his life fit into the larger struggle, but DC4 merely hints at powerful, ugly truths. The album’s cover is a collage of court documents (including his plea agreement) and a mug shot of an 18-year-old Meek, his face bandaged and eye swollen after a beat down from black cops. But he went harder on Funkmaster Flex’s Hot 97 show than he does on record, eloquently questioning the morality of the prison system and Flint’s poisoned water. Time will tell if Meek’s legacy outlasts the embarrassing Drake episode, as the only questions DC4 has answered are related to how he’d like his famous friends to promote his new record. But as an MC, Meek’s considerable potential remains untapped.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22575-dc4/,Maybach,2016.0,"Hailing from Philadelphia, Meek Mill has been making waves in the rap game since his debut album in 2012. Fast forward to 2016, and we have DC4, a highly anticipated release that showcases the rapper's growth and maturity as an artist.

Meek Mill has had a tumultuous journey to get to this point. He's been in and out of jail, had public feuds with other rappers, and faced backlash from critics who doubted his talent. Despite these obstacles, Meek has persevered and continues to prove doubters wrong.

DC4 is an embodiment of this unrelenting spirit. The album's creation story is rooted in Meek's reconciliation with fellow rapper, Drake, after a heated feud. The two joined forces for the track ""Going Bad,"" which became a chart-topping hit. This collaboration set the tone for the rest of the album, as it features an impressive list of guest artists.

The album's opening track, ""On The Regular,"" sets the tone for what's to come, as Meek's high-energy delivery and piercing lyrics captivate from the start. Throughout the album, Meek delves into various subject matters, from the dangers of street life in ""Shine"" to his come-up in Philly in ""Blue Notes.""

Amidst the bangers and braggadocious bars, Meek also shows his lyrical versatility on tracks like ""Tony Story 3,"" where he tells a vivid story of a drug dealer's rise and fall. The storytelling on this track is particularly notable, as Meek's flow and wordplay keep listeners engaged from start to finish.

While DC4 definitely has its strong points, there are some moments where the album falls short. The track ""Froze,"" featuring Lil Uzi Vert and Nicki Minaj, feels lackluster and out of place compared to the rest of the project. Additionally, some of the features on the album don't quite hit the mark, such as Quavo's uninspired verse on ""The Difference.""

Overall, DC4 is a solid effort from Meek Mill that showcases his growth as an artist. The album has its highs and lows, but Meek's lyricism and storytelling shine through on the tracks that garner the most attention. While the project may not be a masterpiece, it's definitely worth checking out for fans of the rapper and the genre. I give it a rating of 6.9 out of 10.","1.

Samantha Urbani,Policies of Power EP,Pop/R&B,7.2,August 19 2017,Claire Lobenfeld,Contributor,"Samantha Urbani has been exploring the boundaries of pop music since her days as a founder and frontwoman of the Bushwick group Friends. The collective—who channeled ESG and Stacey Q.—was a Brooklyn DIY staple and one among a coterie of producers and performers finding blog acclaim for pushing pop outside of its overly-manufactured confines (see: Charli XCX’s “Nuclear Seasons,” MNDR’s “Fade to Black”). Like other subcultures before it, alt-pop was a direct response to 2010s Top 40 despondency. The artists creating some of the hookiest songs of the year weren’t necessarily trying to navigate the indie world, but rather trying to make glossy, catchy music whose substance and heart were in plain view. “The current, tragic state of pop music doesn’t mean that people should forget about great pop artists of the past or write off the genre’s future,” Urbani said in 2012. “Look at somebody like Prince, for example; he was such a genius who was in control of all aspects of his music, and he still made complex yet commercially palatable music with a statement behind it.” Five years later, Urbani has readied her debut, a five-track collection called Policies of Power. If her goal is simply to have control over music and create sonic and lyrical depth while still being primed for radio, then she ticked all of those boxes easily with her EP. Featuring two songs released in 2015 (“1 2 3 4” and “U Know I Know”), Power is a product of patience. In 2016, she launched her own record label URU (as in “you are you”) where she first reissued overlooked British synth-pop duo Rexy’s 1981 album Running Out of Time. The reissue was released in tandem with a covers series for which she enlisted people like Ariel Pink and Zoë Kravitz, among others, to perform alongside her. Her own music stayed on the back-burner. Even though one of her oldies, “1 2 3 4,” is the most euphoric point on the album, the new songs are deft and nuanced—synths make way for sax on “Time Time Time” (supplied by Sade’s co-writer and “Smooth Operator” saxophonist Stuart Matthewman) and ’80s hair metal shredding goes bubblegum on “Hints & Implications.” The vibe can feel more suited to a decades-old, forgotten teen comedy, but because Urbani’s lyrics avoid platitudes, it scans as something more grounded and mature. “No more invitations/I got the hint that you don’t want them,” she sings on the hook. “Without the same information/We’re living in two separate dimension/So break it to me.” It isn’t as detailed as the failed romance narratives some like Kelela displays so baldly, but it is far more personal than the vague missives pop so often provides. “Go Deeper” pulls out the same shattered poetry: “I had an attitude/And you can't, can't, can't stand that/I hear you, respect your solitude/But was it poetry when you told me you would be right back?” Some listeners will suspect that lines like these are about her former paramour Dev Hynes, but those coming to the EP for indie gossip are here for the wrong reason. Urbani’s big draw is her contrast, the elation that glows behind the sadness revealing more and more layers of her sound and personality. Policies of Power may only suffer because it does have so much style. Urbani is often compared to Madonna because of her ’80s throwbacks caked in contemporary gloss. But unlike some mainstream pop music that is incubated in songwriting camps with each piece fabricated until it is blemish-free, Urbani’s music comes almost entirely from herself. Considering the time it took for her to reveal who she is and the art she wants to make, it was worth the wait.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/samantha-urbani-policies-of-power-ep/,"Lucky Number,URU",2017.0,"Welcome to my review of Samantha Urbani's EP, ""Policies of Power."" With this release, Urbani sets her sights on the intersection of pop and R&B, creating a sound that is both danceable and introspective. Overall, I'd give the album a rating of 7.2 out of 10. Let's dive into what makes this EP worth your attention.

First, let's talk about Urbani's background. Some may recognize her as the former frontwoman of the band Friends, which gained popularity in the early 2010s. With this new release, Urbani has taken her musical career in a more solo direction, honing her sound and style along the way.

The creative process behind ""Policies of Power"" is particularly interesting. According to Urbani, this EP was born out of a period of political frustration and a desire to tackle big social issues through her music. On this album, we see Urbani attempting to grapple with themes like power, corruption, and inequality over a backdrop of synth-heavy beats and funk-infused grooves.

Personally, I found the EP to be both engaging and thought-provoking. Urbani is a talented songwriter, and her talents are on clear display throughout this release. For example, one standout track for me was ""Bad Situation,"" which tackles the toxic effects of power dynamics in relationships. The lyrics are raw and honest, and the melody is simultaneously catchy and melancholic. 

Another highlight of this album is Urbani's vocal range. She has a powerful voice that can easily switch between sultry and soaring, and it's fascinating to hear her experiment with different vocal styles on each track. The EP's title track, ""Policies of Power,"" is a particularly good example of this, as Urbani uses her voice to convey a sense of defiance and anger.

That being said, some tracks on the EP did fall a bit flat for me. While I appreciate Urbani's commitment to experimenting with different musical styles, some tracks felt a bit disjointed or underdeveloped. For example, ""Go Deeper"" starts off promisingly, with a catchy beat and a funky bassline, but the chorus doesn't quite hook me in the way I hoped it would.

In conclusion, ""Policies of Power"" is a solid EP that showcases Samantha Urbani's talents as a songwriter and vocalist. While not every track is a home run, there are definitely some standout moments that make this release worth a spin. If you're a fan of pop and R&B with a socially conscious edge, then give this EP a listen. You won't be disappointed.","1.

EMA,Exile in the Outer Ring,Rock,8.0,August 25 2017,Judy Berman,Contributor,"Red State, the first and only album by Erika M. Anderson’s late-2000s noise-folk trio, Gowns, opens with a bleak but hopeful spoken-word tableau. Over morbid drones, Anderson describes a soldier’s bedroom in Fargo, N.D., “with an American flag draped over a basement window.” She listlessly names the various drugs consumed one summer in that subterranean chamber. Titled “Fargo,” the brief track ends with an image of secular transcendence. Echoed by what sounds like a heavenly chorus of junkies, Anderson recalls that “the light shining in through the window was golden/And the days stretched out as far as the horizon/And you could see the dust flow like sparkles in the air.” A decade later, Red-state rhetoric feels more suffocating than ever, Anderson is now the solo artist EMA, and her new album, Exile in the Outer Ring, ends with a similar scene. Her voice emerges from a mist of feedback as she recounts an escape attempt: “I ran away/To the darkest place that I could find:/A basement in the Outer Ring/It was an interior that was familiar to me/ The smoke, the blinds/Sometimes sunlight coming in/And sometimes street lamps/Brighter now than they used to be/Casting lines on beige carpeting.” This time, there’s no redemption to be found. Darkness pervades the squalid room, even with the lights on. “It seems to be closing in from around the edges,” Anderson whispers, “but it’s possible that it’s coming from inside you.” Contrast these two views of American alienation: If the former is a vérité-style documentary on life in Anderson’s native Dakotas during George W. Bush’s hawkish, theocratic presidency, then the latter is a horror movie that captures the darkly surreal mood of the Trump era. Fargo is an actual city. The Outer Ring is an imagined territory that may substantially overlap with certain segments of the U.S. electorate, where broken dreams and desperation metastasize into a B-movie monster of uncontrollable rage. Anderson has said that she finished writing Exile before the end of last year’s presidential primaries. Coming from an artist whose prescience about societal preoccupations yielded an entire album, 2014’s The Future’s Void, suffused with the same kind of technology anxiety that is fueling the current “fake news” panic, that’s entirely believable. And Exile’s timing might’ve made it a more complex work than it would have been if it had been composed after Trump’s victory. In the past few years, EMA has released a series of overtly political songs, from “Active Shooter” to her cover of Sinead O’Connor’s “Black Boys on Mopeds.” Accompanied by a lyric video in which phrases like “no hate” and “no xenophobia” appear over images of rural decay, Exile’s deceptively catchy first single, “Aryan Nation,” seemed to promise more of the same. But the album turns out to be an atmospheric, character-driven narrative more than a polemic, and that makes it a more graceful political statement than the singles that preceded it. EMA doesn’t distance herself from the angry, poor, white, largely male milieu she understands intimately, having grown up in South Dakota. Instead, she channels her own leftist, female rage through the abject rhetoric of Middle America. She has described her persona on Exile as “a woman who swallowed a scumbag teen boy whole,” and the fusion of those two points of view is astonishingly seamless. At the chorus of “Aryan Nation,” Anderson’s voice goes from sweet to strained as she sings, “Tell me stories of famous men/I can’t see myself in them/We could steal, we could steal, we could steal/But we’re stealing from them.” A tornado of noise gathers before Anderson’s torrential vocals kick in and propel us through “33 Nihilistic and Female,” whose title is self-explanatory. The Outer Ring has an aesthetic. It is the creeping dread of “Breathalyzer,” whose six minutes of jittery synths, echoing drum beats, and narcotized vocals paint a blurry picture of an intoxicated suburban couple in a landscape of big-box stores and parking lots. The music video follows a white woman with a nose ring, a bondage collar, and a baggy FUBU parka who rides with a male companion (gold chain, black baseball cap, red-tinted glasses) through a desolate suburban landscape. Anderson appears as a drug dealer, selling a glow-in-the-dark paste that the woman spreads under her long nails. This is a reminder that the Outer Ring isn’t exactly the real world, but rather an uncanny, impressionistic rendering of life on America’s fringes—dirtbag cyberpunk. Anderson’s ideas and lyrics tend to be so compelling, they drown out any discussion of her songwriting. But it’s a mistake to consider her words or sounds in isolation, especially on Exile. The album is a bridge from EMA’s past to the present, fusing Red State’s drones and fuzz and political-made-personal portraiture with the dystopian sci-fi of The Future’s Void. From her excellent solo debut, 2011’s Past Life Martyred Saints, it takes pop vocal melodies and the sparse, explosive percussion of “California.” What’s unique to Exile is the unreal world of the Outer Ring, which is as well developed in the music as it is in the lyrics and videos. To a base of noise, folk, and pop, Anderson adds industrial coldness, in the pounding and clanging of “Fire Water Air LSD” and the buzzsaw synths of “Breathalyzer.” These sounds will force many of us who are 33, nihilistic and female (especially if we’re white and grew up outside of any major urban center) to recall blasting Nine Inch Nails in grimy, ’90s bedrooms with disaffected white boys who might have grown up to be neo-Nazis. There is empathy in EMA’s insistence on revisiting that place and making us remember the anger it incubates, but don’t mistake Exile in the Outer Ring for some “understanding Trump’s America” thinkpiece. It’s a horror movie. It does not have a happy ending.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ema-exile-in-the-outer-ring/,City Slang,2017.0,"If you're looking for an album that perfectly captures the feeling of being lost and alienated in an increasingly hostile world, EMA's ""Exile in the Outer Ring"" might just be the one for you. With a blend of rock and electronic influences, this record is a haunting and powerful exploration of contemporary life and politics.

EMA, otherwise known as Erika M. Anderson, has been on the music scene for some time now, with her debut album ""Past Life Martyred Saints"" receiving critical acclaim in 2011. Since then, she has continued to evolve her sound, covering topics like depression, intergenerational trauma, and the rise of nationalism. ""Exile in the Outer Ring"" feels like a natural extension of her oeuvre, but perhaps even more nuanced and ambitious than anything she's done before.

As for the creation of this album, Anderson has stated that it was inspired by her experiences living in a working-class suburb of Portland, Oregon. She saw firsthand how the people in the outer ring, as she puts it, were being left behind by globalism and neoliberalism, and how that was leading to feelings of frustration, hopelessness, and anger. This sense of dislocation and disorientation permeates every track on this record, from the explosive opening of ""7 Years"" to the haunting atmospherics of ""I Wanna Destroy"".

One of the things that really stands out about ""Exile in the Outer Ring"" is the way that it incorporates different musical styles and influences. There's a sense of experimentation here, as EMA blends rock, electronic, industrial, and even country music into something that is uniquely her own. The guitar work in particular is top-notch, with Anderson's riffs veering from delicate and melancholic to distorted and aggressive.

But it's not just about the music; the lyrics on this album are also incredibly powerful. Anderson's poetry is raw and honest, dealing with themes like poverty, addiction, violence, and resistance. It's clear that she has a lot of empathy for the people she's singing about, and a deep understanding of the systemic issues that are affecting their lives. Tracks like ""Down and Out"" and ""Breathalyzer"" are especially potent, with Anderson's vocals conveying a sense of emotional intensity and vulnerability.

Zomby,Ultra,Electronic,7.9,September 6 2016,Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,"The lead single to Zomby’s first album in more than three years was not terribly auspicious. Sure, in the run-up to its release, the prospect sounded almost too good to be true: Zomby and Burial together at last—bass music’s two most notoriously hermetic producers emerging from their studio lairs bearing, one could only assume, fistfuls of charcoal and lightning. But their collaboration “Sweetz” sounded half-assed: desultory in spirit, scattered in form, and overlaid with an insistent vocal loop insisting, “Get me fucked up/Get me fucked up/Get me fucked up,” over and over, like the inner monologue of a user whose serotonin receptors have long since scabbed over. Heard on its own, it didn't sound like much. But “Sweetz” turns out to make a strange kind of sense in the context of the album. Its weird twists and turns draw you in; its lysergic extremes fuck you up. In its dead-eyed way, it comes alive. Zomby has never played to expectations. From his early, squirrelly dubstep singles and the full-bore breakbeat hardcore of his debut album, 2008’s Where Were U in ’92?—an album that helped set up a broad wave of British rave revivalism from artists like Lone, Special Request, and even Jamie xx—he veered into unexpectedly sentimental territory with 2011’s expansive Dedication, his first album for 4AD. It was a promising turn of affairs, the famously cagey artist finally wearing his heart on his Balmain sleeve. But 2013’s With Love tested even his most stalwart fans’ patience. Its grim mood hung like a pall, and many of its 33 tracks felt like unfinished sketches; some of them, like “Digital Smoke” and “Entropy Sketch,” were merely variants of each other, separated by inelegant fadeouts. But Ultra is the most self-assured Zomby record in ages, and a huge step forward from the slightly pro-forma DJ tools of last year’s Let's Jam!! EPs. Even at its darkest—which is to say, most of it—he sounds like he’s enjoying himself, from the triumphant fanfare of the opening “Reflection” to the regal tones of the closing “Thaw.” Sometimes, he’s in and out in two minutes, just to see what kind of sparks fly when one sound rubs up against another. Elsewhere, he lets loops tumble on as long as he likes. That strategy doesn’t always work: the cycling synths and voices of “Fly 2” abruptly drop in tempo some two-and-a-half minutes into the tune and then continue spinning away for three more minutes, slow and stuporous, like a battery-operated toy running low on charge. “Her,” on the other hand, is perfect—just a four-bar chord progression made of bright, gleaming synths and booming, Phil Collins-grade toms. It’s so hopeful it makes you a little nervous, because nothing in life works out as well as the utopia it promises. Ultra is also Zomby’s most experimental record in ages. That might sound strange, given how many of his usual tropes come into play: video-game bleeps, laser blasts, gun-cock samples, and all the other accouterments of grime. But, particularly after the polished sonics of With Love, he’s letting himself get weird again. “Burst” may employ the same arcade chirps that he’s used forever, but the way the stuttering synth riff seems to slow down in mid-tumble is unusual, like grime turned gelatinous. “Quandary,” a co-production with Darkstar, pairs the pinging of tilting pinball machines with a bouncy lead that's almost Caribbean in feel. It’s a disorienting listening experience, especially the drums' mismatched, tangled reverb tails. You feel torn different ways at once—which, given the title, might be the point. It’s not all so successful. The drab, bitcrushed “E.S.P.,” reminiscent of Actress’ desiccated atmospheres, feels longer than its three minutes; “Yeti,” an icy grime tune in the mold of Wiley’s “Eskimo” or “Igloo” is rather superfluous coming right after “Freeze,” another bright, brittle grime track that sounds absolutely fantastic. (Zomby presumably thought that placing such similar tunes together would be illuminating, and it is: He still hasn’t perfected the art of editing down his tracklists.) And some of his choices, like the gunshots and “Twin Peaks” monologue of “Reflection,” feel slightly uninspired for an artist whose public persona puts such a premium on audacity. But those are minor quibbles, because when he's on, he’s on. The sparkling “Glass,” the sorrowful “I,” the rough-cut jungle of “S.D.Y.F.” (“So Dance You Fuckers”), a collaboration with The Trilogy Tapes’ Rezzett—all of it finds Zomby sounding refreshed and invigorated. On the closing “Thaw,” he even sets the drums aside, lavishing all his attention on an absolutely gorgeous set of chords played on an absolutely gorgeous set of synthesizer patches. You can hear his passion for fashion coming to the surface here: It resembles draping; it sounds expensive, and it suggests that he’s still got a few tricks up his sleeve.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22322-ultra/,Hyperdub,2016.0,"Electronic music fans, thanks to Zomby's 2011 release ""Ultra,"" can enjoy one of the most creative and versatile albums of its kind. With its distinctive production and its ability to incorporate an eclectic range of musical genres, ""Ultra"" proves to be a stunning precedent for electronic music production.

Zomby, a stage name for the English musician and producer Oliver Jones, began his career in the early 2000s. He has since become a prolific electronic music star, releasing a large number of tracks and remixes that have garnered praise from fans and critics alike. Zomby’s music has been described as a combination of UK Garage, Dubstep, and Grime, and he is known for his use of cutting-edge technology and rigorous production methods.

Enter ""Ultra,"" one of Zomby's most successful albums in his discography. The album features a very distinct sound that blends together a multitude of genres and influences. Zomby's background in UK Garage and Grime is evident in the frenetic rhythms and synth chords that are prevalent throughout the album. However, Zomby mixes these distinctly English styles with a diverse range of other electronic and dance genres to create a truly unique and original piece of work.

One of the most appealing aspects of ""Ultra"" is its range. Tracks such as ""Labyrinth"" and ""Digital Rain"" are fast and rhythmic, with complex drum patterns that will keep listeners on their toes. Meanwhile, ""Azure"" and ""Mozaik"" are more mellow and introspective, featuring gentle melodies and warm, atmospheric chord progressions.

Personal experience-wise, ""Ultra"" is a perfect album for anyone who wants to get lost in a world of music. Whether you're dancing or relaxing, the variety of sounds that Zomby presents creates an engaging and immersive experience for listeners. The music is deep and complex yet accessible, providing something for both casual and dedicated electronic music fans.

Overall, I would rate this album an impressive 7.9 out of 10. It's a standout piece of work that demonstrates Zomby's skill as a producer, but more than that, it's an incredible listening experience that truly captures the essence of electronic music. ""Ultra"" is a must-listen for anyone who loves electronic music and wants to experience its true potential.","1.

Janet Jackson,Unbreakable,Pop/R&B,8.0,October 6 2015,Anupa Mistry,Contributor,"Montreal producer Kaytranada put out a remix of Janet Jackson's 1993 single ""If"" in the fall of 2012, but the edit, which reimagines the misty original as bubbling, whimsical house, became a party staple. The remix was unique, not just because it lingered on DJ playlists far longer than most major-label hits, but because it created an entry point to then-rising nu-house operatives like Soulection and HW&W via a cross-generational touchpoint like no other: Janet. That gauzy vocal loop, floating in on an elastic bassline, nudged along by dense handclaps and pin-sharp hi-hats, deaded the lumbering, surly dominance of brostep in one fell swoop. What Kaytranada did with the remix is what Janet’s long accomplished over her musical career: she won hearts and bridged imaginations on the dance floor. It’s playful and funky and sensual; it sounds like something Janet would make for herself. And even though it’s been out in the world for three years, the tour DJ on Jackson’s current tour runs it pre-show. Probably the only downside to Janet’s 11th album *Unbreakable—*aside from it running about three tracks too long—is that it doesn’t contain that kind of axis-shifting single. Missy Elliott gives it a try, two-stepping in with a squirmy synthesizer for ""BURNITUP!"" and the lazy bass and airy vocals of ""Dammn Baby"" sounds like Tinashe-meets-Teena Marie. ""The Great Forever"" and ""Night"" are formally ambitious pop songs, but don’t deliver as much personality as 2004’s underrated Damita Jo. Instead, Unbreakable is a synthesis of ideas Jackson’s collected and tested throughout her career. ""2 B Loved"", with its cavalcade of hoots and hollers, is probably the album’s most ""now""-sounding song. ""No Sleeep,"" the dusky R&B single, is quintessential Jam & Lewis-abetted Janet. A sweet melody and ribald Isley Brothers sample builds a sultry Quiet Storm groove. Even the silly J. Cole feature can't prevent it from being one of the best songs of the year, a conscious curving of the melismatic summertime bombast of chart-toppers like the Weeknd, Jidenna, OMI, and Bieber. It came out in June, in time for warm summer nights, but fits in better with the enveloping dark of fall. Like Janet, it's timeless. The story here is love and catharsis. It's her first album since Michael Jackson's death in 2009, and the dissolution of her relationship with Jermaine Dupri. The warm, acoustic guitar sway of the title track sets the tone: these are giddy, grateful grown-woman songs. Janet's settled into a new relationship and, if songs like ""After You Fall"" and ""Broken Hearts Heal"", are any indication, ruminating with love on her brother's life and death. On the former she dips into her lower register whilst singing over a somber piano line; on the latter, an uptempo pop song filled with sunny harmonies, she tilts her voice skyward, singing a song of praise about childhood memories and afterlives with an Arabic 'inshallah' on the hook. Jackson, now married to a Qatari businessman, remains private about her personal life but has reportedly converted to Islam. And that one word coming from a pop icon does more for a post-9/11 world than Unbreakable's social-message songs like ""Black Eagle"", and especially ""Shoulda Known Better"", a start-stop fist-pumper about reading beyond the headlines that's two choruses and a verse too long. This ability to synthesize what music needs instead of catering to its whims is what has made Janet Jackson an enduring pop star. Unlike Madonna, whose presence and work open up much-needed conversations about sexuality, commodity, and the gendered age biases of pop music, Jackson, 49, exposes these conventions as construct. Unbreakable might be her most demure album in years, but that doesn't mean it's not sexy. Its strength comes from savvy instead of gimmickry, returning to the producers and formula Jackson built her career on (jubilant dance-pop, bedroom R&B, that angelic giggle). Because Unbreakable is about putting faith in one's career and fans, it plays like the natural next phase in Jackson's discography, which individually might be markers of their time but are ultimately ageless.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21060-unbreakable/,"BMG,Rhythm Nation",2015.0,"Janet Jackson, the Pop/R&B queen, has once again graced us with her album 'Unbreakable'. With a rating of 8.0 out of 10, this album is definitely worth listening to. As a music enthusiast, I was thrilled to explore the work of a woman who has been making hits since the 80s. 

For those who may not know, Janet Jackson has been in the music industry for over 30 years. She is a living legend who has influenced generations of artists. 'Unbreakable' is her eleventh studio album, released in 2015, after a seven-year break. This album marks the reunion between Janet and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, two of the producers who worked with Janet in her prime years. 

From the vibes of the songs, I could tell that this album took a significant level of thought and precision. It's a carefully crafted album that showcases the kind of artist that promises us an evening of pure entertainment. The album features a blend of Pop/R&B, soulful melodies that bring to the forefront of our minds the reason why we love Janet Jackson. 

One of my favorite tracks from the album is ""Night."" The song's beat is groovy, making it an instant crowd-pleaser that gets you on your feet. The music video for this track is phenomenal! It features Janet dancing like she's 20 again, proving to us that age is just a number. Another track that stood out for me is ""No Sleeep,"" which features J. Cole. Janet's voice is smokey in the song, oozing with seduction and tantalizing whispers. 

Beyond the entertainment value of this album, 'Unbreakable' also features some excellent slow jams, such as ""After You Fall,"" ""Promise,"" and ""The Great Forever."" These tracks prove that Janet is not just about uptempo rhythms, but can also take her time and deliver a soulful and solid ballad. 

In my opinion, 'Unbreakable' was worth the wait. It's an album that speaks to both the millennials and those who grew up listening to Janet. The ability to deliver a hybrid of genres is something that only contemporary artists can master, which Janet has indeed achieved. I can unequivocally say that Janet has made a huge comeback with 'Unbreakable,' an album that will undoubtedly be on any respectable music lover's playlist.","1.

Bear in Heaven,Beast Rest Forth Mouth,Rock,8.4,November 9 2009,Eric Harvey,Contributor,"While it may seem as if there's not a new release without a hyphenated genre to give it birth, Bear in Heaven's second LP feels fresh simply because it resists easy categorization or comparison. This isn't to say it's sonically groundbreaking, though-- fitting for an album whose title references the four main navigational directions, Beast Rest Forth Mouth is as familiar-feeling as it is difficult to pinpoint. Mostly made up of textural, spacious three- to four-minute pop anthems with towering choruses, BRFM is a welcome reminder that an album doesn't have to be bombastic to feel huge and important. Take out the earbuds and let it fill a space: This is music that's bigger than your iPod-- music you'll want to feel all around you. Though not quite coming out of nowhere, BRFM seems like a surprise gift-- a striking consolidation of the spiky psych-prog tendencies of their debut into a pop framework. In terms of career gear-shifts, the move Caribou made with Andorra is the most recent precedent. Though at 41 minutes the album is economical and sharp in its execution, the band-- all from Georgia and Alabama-- still imbues its compositions with the generosity of spirit that makes the best Southern rock so invigorating. ""Beast in Peace"" opens the record with a gentle lockstep before shifting seamlessly into a mile-wide chorus. Then, they expand that chorus even further, like switching to the widest camera lens to capture a vista they just realized the full vastness of. Elsewhere, as its title indicates, ""Ultimate Satisfaction"" is an IMAX-wide ode to what starts out as a simple thought, then turns bodily-- the refrain of ""coming down!"" charts the sensation spreading like a spasm. That towering exultation is also felt on the primal ""Deafening Love"". While aiming for a similar sense of awe-inspiring bliss, ""Love"" widens the focus and luxuriates in the tremors, approximating a more protracted take on Jane's Addiction's ""Mountain Song"". Yet Bear in Heaven's greatest trick is creating music that evokes the sort of physicality and scope that could soundtrack a Hollywood film, but also works equally well at stirring up intimate bodily passion. Lush synth beds, warm electronics accenting polyrhythms, and Jon Philpot's yearning, boyish howl coalesce into a vibe that's muscular without being macho, and which strikes a rare balance between nuanced emotion and overwhelming sensation. Even when delving into more disconcerting subject matter-- dabbling in self-loathing on ""Wholehearted Mess"" or confronting paranoia on the slinky ""You Do You""-- Philpot still manages to imbue the songs with an atmosphere of seduction and intrigue. An album like BRFM couldn't exist without a paean to the most severe and high-stakes of endeavors, and first single ""Lovesick Teenagers"" more than meets the requirements for 2009's Epic Song About Tortured Young Romance. With briskly alternating synth chords spitting by like fast-moving highway stripes, the titular couple are doomed to crash, but most likely in a JG Ballard sort of way. The pair martyr themselves in order to eternalize their passion, and the band is generous enough to resurrect them later, in the reprise of ""Teenagers"" that closes the album, seamlessly and surprisingly emerging from ""Casual Goodbye"". As a gesture, it's a slight nod backwards to the suite-like structures of their debut, but moreoever a celebration of abundance that wraps up an album overflowing with feeling. It's also an exclamation point signaling that Bear in Heaven not only clearly recognize their own best instincts, they're not shy about dwelling on them. Sure, bands can adapt to the current musical climate by adding extras to LPs, tweaking release dates to accommodate fan interest, or even giving away their music free. A curtain call like ""Teenagers"", though: now that's generosity.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13618-beast-rest-forth-mouth/,Hometapes,2009.0,"To begin with, let's talk about the band behind 'Beast Rest Forth Mouth' - Bear in Heaven. Formed in 2003, this Brooklyn-based group has been delivering genre-bending music to their fans for almost a decade. The founder members, Jon Philpot and Adam Wills, were initially part of a band called Presocratics, but when that band disbanded, they decided to form Bear in Heaven. Since then, they've gained a reputation for creating music that's both experimental and accessible.

Coming to 'Beast Rest Forth Mouth,' their third full-length album, it's a roller coaster ride of sounds and emotions. From the opening intro of ""Beast in Peace"" to the closing notes of ""Dust Cloud,"" this album is like a journey that takes you through a world of rock with psychedelic tones and electronic accents. 

What sets Bear in Heaven apart from other bands is their willingness to take risks with their sound. They experiment with different textures and sounds to create music that’s rich and layered. I love how they play with tension and release throughout the album, like in the song ""Deafening Love"" where the buildup to the chorus is cathartic and explosive.

The production and engineering of 'Beast Rest Forth Mouth' are top-notch. The album was co-produced by Jon Philpot and newcomer to the scene, David Wrench. The result is a record that sounds crisp, yet retains its rawness. The drums are punchy, the synths are atmospheric, and the guitar riffs are sharp. Every song is perfectly balanced and mixed, and the attention to detail is remarkable.

One of my favorite tracks is ""You Do You"", which features a catchy bassline that's infectious and unforgettable. This song is the perfect blend of rock and electronic music, something that Bear in Heaven has become known for. It's a feel-good song that you can dance to, but with enough depth to keep you coming back for more.

As a listener, I appreciate how 'Beast Rest Forth Mouth' is an album that can be listened to on repeat. Every time I hear it, I notice something new - a melody here, a sound effect there. It's an album that rewards the attentive listener.

In conclusion, 'Beast Rest Forth Mouth' by Bear in Heaven is a fantastic album that showcases the band's ability to create complex music that's both accessible and experimental. With powerful songs and top-notch production, it's no wonder this album has a rating of 8.4 out of 10. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to explore the breadth of the rock genre.","1.

"Nef the Pharaoh, 03 Greedo",Porter 2 Grape EP,Rap,7.2,July 26 2018,Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,"Last month, 03 Greedo reported to a prison in Texas to serve a 20-year sentence on drug and weapons charges. The week he set foot in the facility, he dropped God Level, an anxious opus that mulls his pending incarceration and its impact on his rapidly ascending career as a rap star. The sentence will rip him away from his family and his fans, but it won’t mark a hard stop to his output: There are dozens of solo and collaborative albums sitting on hard drives, waiting to be parceled out over however long the authorities in Texas keep him caged. Porter 2 Grape is the first such record to surface; it pairs Greedo with Nef the Pharaoh, who distinguished himself in the last couple years as one of the Bay Area’s most exciting and charismatic rappers. Their mixtape together is warm and refreshingly slight. It also reveals that, while Nef’s rise has proven much slower and less stratospheric than Greedo’s, he still possesses the wit, versatility, and magnetism that might land him a larger, nationwide audience. Both Nef and Greedo grew their followings from their hometowns outward, but their relationships with rap’s regionalist conventions are far different. Greedo, who bounced all over the country in his childhood before settling in Watts, is a synthesist, as fluent in popular modes from Atlanta and Baton Rouge as he is in those from L.A. By contrast, when Nef broke through, in 2015, he was rightly singled out as the heir to the Vallejo throne—he even signed with E-40. While Nef’s style is more straightforward, Greedo’s is more in tune with national pop trends on rap radio in most cities; Nef is from a lineage that, save for a few breakout stars, has been hermetically sealed in one location. Nef, though, has absolutely no interest in sitting still. The EP is littered with little odes to traveling: On “Ball Out,” he’s appalled that some of his peers haven’t ridden double-decker buses in London; on “Blow-Up Bed,” he compares his tattoos to the stamps in his passport; he and Greedo brag about being in Paris, Miami, Memphis, everywhere. That jetsetting figures so centrally on Porter is a testament to how both rappers process abstract ideas like fame and success: They ground them in the material changes of their day-to-day lives. How else do you account for the record’s best and most deeply felt song being an upbeat cut about air mattresses? While the rapid pace of Greedo’s writing and recording in the final months before his prison term could have been expected, what’s intriguing about Porter 2 Grape is how carefully his vocals have been attuned to Nef’s. Their harmonizing on the “Blow-Up Bed” hook crystallizes the EP’s promise: Greedo’s voice is stranger than Nef’s, but he comes in softer, more melodic, while Nef is allowed to take the more forceful lead. Throughout the tape, but especially on that song and “Choosy” (the latter also features ALLBLACK and Chris O’Bannon), the two rappers pull one another into breezy, comfortable pockets that not only allow their senses of humor to come through but also communicate appreciation for their incremental progress—and, by implication (and occasionally overtly), lament the ways their advances might be reversed in a matter of seconds. The last song on Porter 2 Grape, “Feeling You,” flips the same Bobby Caldwell sample that 2Pac used for “Heaven Ain’t Hard 2 Find,” the closing number on All Eyez on Me. (There are few better arguments for the symbiosis between Bay rap and L.A. rap than the second disc of All Eyez.) The Pac song is nominally about sex, but there’s a break in the middle where he reveals the neuroses that plague nearly all of his work. Pac was a more linear writer than Greedo and a more self-mythologizing one than Nef. What Porter shares with the breezy back-end cuts on Pac’s masterpiece is the sense that it’s never all good or all bad; that blow-up mattresses can become luxury hotel beds and, occasionally, prison cots.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nef-the-pharaoh-03-greedo-porter-2-grape-ep/,"KILFMB,SickWidIt ,EMPIRE",2018.0,"The Porter 2 Grape EP by Nef the Pharaoh and 03 Greedo is an exciting album that showcases the talent of two rising stars in the rap genre. The EP oozes with the raw and unapologetic energy that has become a hallmark of the West Coast rap scene.

Before delving into the EP, it is worth taking a moment to appreciate the backstory of Nef the Pharaoh and 03 Greedo. Nef the Pharaoh hails from Vallejo, California, and has quickly established himself as one of the most promising young rappers in the game. He has a distinct style that blends old-school West Coast vibes with more contemporary flows, and his lyrics are always brutally honest.

03 Greedo, on the other hand, has a more turbulent background. The Watts native was sentenced to 20 years in prison for drug trafficking, but still managed to record and release a number of projects from behind bars. His music is a reflection of the harsh realities of his life, and he brings an undeniable rawness to every track he features on.

The Porter 2 Grape EP was recorded following Nef the Pharaoh and 03 Greedo's chance meeting in the studio. The two struck up an immediate rapport, bonding over their shared love of music and street life. It is this chemistry that makes the EP so compelling.

The EP opens with ""Ball Out,"" a banger that showcases both artists at their best. Nef the Pharaoh's flow is infectious, and 03 Greedo's delivery is as raw as ever. ""Pluto"" is another standout track, with a dreamy beat and a catchy hook that will stay in your head for days.

What really makes Porter 2 Grape stand out, however, is the authenticity of the lyrics. Both Nef the Pharaoh and 03 Greedo have lived through the experiences they rap about, and it shows. The EP is filled with tales of street life, heartbreak, and the daily struggles that come with trying to make it in the music industry.

In terms of production, Porter 2 Grape is solid but not groundbreaking. The beats are simple and catchy, but they don't necessarily break any new ground. However, this is more than made up for by the raw and unbridled energy of the rapping.

Overall, the Porter 2 Grape EP is a promising release from two of the most exciting young rappers in the game. While it may not be a groundbreaking release, it is authentic and unapologetic, and it showcases the unique chemistry between Nef the Pharaoh and 03 Greedo.

Lexxi,5TARB01,Electronic,8.0,August 17 2016,Thea Ballard,Contributor,"London-based producer Lexxi’s “Red Eyez” served as the closer on Elysia Crampton’s excellent July release Demon City. Crisp and determined, the track did the tough work of providing resolution to Crampton’s thematically and sonically sprawling album, setting the listener in a dark-but-hopeful present. A version of “Red Eyez” reappears on Lexxi’s debut EP 5STARBOI—this time, weighted down by the introduction of blown-out bass—linking the two projects; Crampton herself tweeted that Demon City “is really just an advertisement for Lexxi’s *5TARBO1 *EP, a poem and captivating accomplishment in its own right.” The succinctness of “Red Eyez” carries throughout the five tracks that comprise 5STARBOI. Where their collaborations on Demon City embraced collage, Lexxi’s solo material is notably direct. “Pared-down” might be an overstatement, as his compositions are still generously adorned, hissing and crackling at the seams, but if Demon City stretched to encompass both past and future, *5TARBOI *takes place in a single wide-eyed moment. The EP opens with an anarchic deluge of synth noise, which swiftly gives way to the sort of icy, winding phrase Lexxi is particularly skilled at making. His melodies, which are generally quite simple and will reiterate for the length of a track, bring to mind a less-elastic Arca. Bookended by squalls of texture and undergirded by stuttering grime-inflected beats, this music is certainly aggressive (angry, even) but by no means relentless. On “$ever0” (whose title references severo, a style pioneered by Lexxi, Crampton, and their friends: “an accumulation or accretion, an ongoing process of becoming-with,” as Crampton recently described it to Resident Advisor), a creeping rhythm is met with ambient tones and metallic echoes—pacing that’s far from the club. It brings to mind a somewhat-more-contemporary version of the sort of affected London sound in Zomby and Burial’s saddest tracks; similarly, this is music that is very much marked by urban space. What differentiates this set of tracks from such UK forebears, and draws it even closer to associates like Chino Amobi, Lotic, and Crampton, is its nuanced emotional tenor. *5TARBOI *feels balefully of-the-moment, acutely aware of its surroundings. At its heart, it’s a statement of youth, a coming-of-age record, even. And, tinged with sadness, this coming-of-age can be as much a mourning as it is a celebration. Any moody restraint sustained elsewhere on the release is cast aside on closer “Up Top,” an anthem with both crushing and delicate elements. Its melancholic climax winds across octaves, while an errant synth screeches uncomfortably close to atonal territory; the track finishes on an unresolved note. Lexxi captures a feeling of cathartic dissolution, a moment when coming into being means coming undone.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22234-5tarb01/,Endless Xclusive,2016.0,"Electronic music has always been a genre that intrigues and ignites my senses with its unique use of sounds and beats.

Firstly, let's talk about the band's history. Lexxi is a relatively new band that only formed a few years ago. Made up of two talented musicians, their music has been described as a journey through waves of electronic soundscapes, each one unique yet intertwined. The duo has quickly made a name for themselves in the music industry, with their fresh sound and unique style.

Now, let's move on to the creation story of '5TARB01'. From the opening track, it was evident that this album was going to be something special. The album is a collection of ten tracks that take the listener on a cosmic journey through electronic soundscapes. The band used a range of different sounds and instruments to create the captivating beats and melodies that make up this album.

The production quality of '5TARB01' is immaculate. From the opening track, I was drawn into the world that the band created. Each track is a carefully crafted piece of art, with different sounds and beats layered together to create music that is both melodic and energizing.

Personally, I was blown away by the range of sounds and emotions that Lexxi was able to capture within this album. Tracks like ""Midnight Stroll"" and ""Celestial Dreams"" are perfect examples of how the band was able to mix different elements to create something truly unique. The use of unconventional sounds and rhythms made these tracks stand out from anything I have heard before.

One thing I really appreciated about this album was the attention to detail that the band showed. The mix of different sounds and instruments was blended together flawlessly, creating an overall sound that was both cohesive and varied.

In conclusion, '5TARB01' by Lexxi is an album that any electronic music lover should listen to. With its captivating beats and rhythms, combined with exquisite production and attention to detail, this album was a joy to listen to from start to finish. I give it a rating of 8.0 out of 10, because while it is an incredible album, there are still areas that could be improved. If you are a fan of electronic music, then this album is definitely worth your time.","Step by step reasoning:

Lullaby for the Working Class,Song,"Folk/Country,Pop/R&B,Rock",4.8,September 21 1999,Neil Lieberman,,"Suppose I started writing about a turtle crossing a hot, desert highway. Suppose I wrote in great and excruciating detail of the turtle's slow journey, describing each deliberate motion in real time as you read on in search of my thoughts on Lullaby for the Working Class' third album, Song. Maybe I'd slow continue on about the turtle's journey across the highway-- about how cars of varying makes and models (which I also would describe to you, along with the conditions of their paint jobs and their drivers) zoomed past it, you would eventually grow bored and tired, clicking over to the Pitchfork news page to find out once and for all whether or not Pavement actually broke up. Now imagine sitting next to me on the bus. I'm telling you a story about my fourth birthday. A half an hour has passed and you've already learned of the grand party thrown for me by my parents. You've learned of the clown that scared children as clowns inevitably do, and of the large cake upon which ""Happy Birthday, Neil"" was written in icing. Now, if you're of right mind, you're shooting out the door at the next stop, or perhaps even jumping out the window as the bus slows for a turn. In either of the above cases, you might notice the care with which I tell my story, recognizing certain beautiful episodes. You'd notice the sensitivity with which I wrote of the truck driver who swerves to hit the turtle, or the sublime beauty of a drunken clown's gift to a boy on the anniversary of the kid's birth. But in the end, you'd be bored. Neither of these tales are particularly compelling in and of themselves, and told slowly in terrible detail, they only become bogged in their own pointlessness. Lullaby for the Working Class' Song is the sound of that bogging. About a year ago, I wrote on this website of Chris Whitley's guitar stylings, noting his incredible ability to elicit more sound out of a single guitar than many full bands can coax from their instruments. That statement holds true when talking about Lullaby. Eleven people play on the album's first track, ""Expand, Contract,"" and after untold listening, all eleven fail to even dent my consciousness. Sure, the band's nearly symphonic arrangements are pretty, but here they function only to their own ineffective end. Without individually compelling songs to add support, the arrangements are details without a storyline. Unfortunately, a reverse paradigm operates throughout the album. The songs seem to serve merely as skeletons for the band's arrangements, creating the ultimate irony of the album's title. A secondary irony exists in the album's structure, which both begins and ends with long droning buzzes that serve as the album's only attention- grabbing moments. But guys, why limit yourself to just the working class? The rich could sleep to this just as well.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4910-song/,"Bar/None,Bar/None",,"If you're a fan of Folk/Country, Pop/R&B, and Rock music, then you should definitely check out 'Song' by Lullaby for the Working Class. This album, which has a rating of 4.8 out of 10, might not be for everyone, but I found it to be quite an enjoyable and unique listening experience.

To start with, let's talk about the band's history. Lullaby for the Working Class originally formed in Lincoln, Nebraska in the early 1990s. They were known for their eclectic mix of influences, which included everything from Neil Young to The Beatles. Over the years, they released a handful of critically acclaimed albums, but their music never really caught on with mainstream audiences.

Fast forward to the year 2000, when they released 'Song,' their fourth and final album. According to the band, this album was meant to be a departure from their previous work. They wanted to create something that was more experimental and less tied to any particular genre.

And that's exactly what they did. 'Song' is a mishmash of styles and sounds, with each track taking the listener on a different journey. The album opens with ""Midwestern,"" a slow-burning folk ballad that sets the tone for the rest of the record. But from there, things start to get a little crazier.

""Spetember's Coming Soon"" is a poppy R&B track that sounds like it could have been a hit in the 90s. ""London Lives"" is a sprawling, psychedelic rock song that seems to go on forever. And ""Lighthouse"" is a hauntingly beautiful acoustic track that might just be the highlight of the album.

I'll admit that not every track on 'Song' is a winner. Some of the experiments don't quite work, and there are definitely moments where the album feels a bit disjointed. But overall, I found this to be a fascinating and rewarding listening experience.

As for my personal experience and opinions, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by 'Song.' I had never heard of Lullaby for the Working Class before, and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But I found myself getting sucked in by the album's eclectic mix of sounds and styles. The production is excellent throughout, with lots of intricate and unexpected details that reveal themselves upon repeated listens.

Overall, I'd say that 'Song' is a worthy addition to any eclectic music collection. It's not perfect, but it's certainly an interesting and unique piece of work. So if you're in the mood for something a little out of the ordinary, give Lullaby for the Working Class a chance. You might just be pleasantly surprised.","1.

Grails,Take Refuge in Clean Living,"Metal,Rock",7.8,June 24 2008,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"The members of the Portland, Oregon-based Grails may wish that reviews of their albums didn't always open with references to bong water and lava lamps. They are clearly serious musicians, after all, and though their music swims in 1970s head-rock signifiers-- reverbed guitar washes, droning sitars, and drum-circle bongos? Don't mind if I do!-- it builds momentum with an unforced grace and attention to detail that warrants more careful consideration than corny jokes about incense and beanbag chairs allow. But when you decide to name the opening track on your fourth album of warmly pulsing instrumental rock ""Stoned at the Taj Again""-- well, you're just asking for it. Actually, the stoner-rock tag probably wouldn't bother these guys much. They identify themselves on their MySpace page as-- gasp!-- a jam band, and thoughtfully name-check Pink Floyd right up front, so that we don't have to. The five long-form compositions that comprise Take Refuge In Clean Living all occupy more or less the same languorous headspace and blend together into a pleasantly hypnotic whole. But repeat listens reveal a sturdy musical intelligence upholding the entire affair, which is probably why an album this drowsy never once feels aimless. ""Stoned at the Taj"" builds slowly from a mammoth-sounding two-note synthesizer riff into some delicate pentatonic guitar noodling before the central motif, a hazy four-note sitar refrain, announces itself, and the track launches into a raga-rock rave-up that recalls the Byrds. (Throughout the album, it should be said, Grails demonstrate the effortless command of faux-Easternisms that only lifelong study of ""Eight Miles High"" and ""Kashmir"" provides.) Elsewhere, Take Refuge offers a haunted cover of the Ventures' ""11th Hour"" that transforms cool surf-rock into windswept desert-rock via a cavern of reverb and an imperial harpsichord; the result could pass off as incidental music for David Lynch's Inland Empire. That air of dark mystery, which pervades the album, is partly due to the skillful arrangements, but also comes from the immaculate mastering and production, which makes heavy use of contrast and lends the appropriate air of otherworldliness. The best moments on Take Refuge in Clean Living resemble ""a pinch felt in a dream,"" to quote another (far superior) album that takes place in a similar numinous middle distance: Perfect From Now On. Grails have been honing their spaghetti-western drone-rock for almost a decade, and have reached a point where they can skillfully fold just about any element into their ambient haze. To say that nothing stands out from the whole on Take Refuge is not so much an insult as it is an observation that Grails have succeeded in their aims, which is to create a full-length that flows uninterrupted from start to finish. There is something charmingly anachronistic about this goal, and it adds to the appealing sense that Grails exist in a kind of time warp. After all, it was never really considered ""cool"" to make this sort of music, but that hasn't stopped three or four generations of bands from turning down the lights and attempting to craft something resembling a soundscape. And there are moments here-- especially on the quietly gorgeous cello-and-piano coda ""Clean Living""-- where Grails successfully transcend the trappings of their genre and tap into something truly celestial.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11605-take-refuge-in-clean-living/,Important,2008.0,"Are you looking for a music album that will leave you thoroughly satisfied? One that merges metal and rock so seamlessly that you can't quite tell where one genre ends and the other begins? If so, then I have just the album for you. Grail's ""Take Refuge in Clean Living"" is a sonic masterpiece.

Grails is a band that has been around since the early 2000s, and their journey has been an interesting one. Initially started as a collaboration between two members of the band Holy Sons, the band went through various lineup changes before settling on a core group of musicians. Over the years, they have developed a unique sound, which is both heavy and atmospheric. And their latest album, ""Take Refuge in Clean Living,"" is undoubtedly the pinnacle of their musical journey.

The album took a few years to create, and the hard work and dedication of the band members shine through in every note. The first thing that strikes you about the album is the sheer intensity of the music. It's heavy, but not in a way that feels oppressive or overwhelming. Each song takes you on a journey, like a well-written story that unfolds over time.

As a metal and rock enthusiast, I was pleasantly surprised by the album's versatility. It's not just about hard-hitting riffs and thunderous drums. There are moments of serenity, where the band pulls back and allows the music to breathe, showcasing their keen sense of dynamics.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""The Natural Man,"" which starts with an ominous bass line and gradually builds into a soaring and climactic finale. The use of keyboards and synths adds a layer of complexity to the music, and the result is an otherworldly experience unlike any other.

Another standout track is ""All the Colors of the Dark,"" which has a hypnotic quality that draws you in and refuses to let go. The use of strings and horns adds to the grandeur of the music, making it feel like you're listening to a cinematic masterpiece.

In conclusion, ""Take Refuge in Clean Living"" is an album that every fan of metal and rock should have in their collection. It's a testament to the band's growth and dedication to their craft, and it's clear that they poured their hearts and souls into creating something truly special. So go ahead and take a listen, you won't be disappointed. I certainly wasn't. I give this album a solid rating of 8.5 out of 10.","1.

Vaura,The Missing,,7.5,December 4 2013,Grayson Currin,Contributor,"If you’re checking résumés, the New York quartet Vaura probably seems daunting. Two of its members, bassist Toby Driver and guitarist Kevin Hufnagel, have logged recent time in some of heavy metal’s more dense and complicated units. Hufnagel counters Luc Lemay in the relaunched version of Gorguts and plays guitar with perpetually knotty instrumental trio Dysrhythmia. Driver, meanwhile, is the mastermind of the ever-recondite Kayo Dot and a survivor of the wonderfully exploratory maudlin of the Well. The pedigree of the band’s other half—drummer Charlie Schmid and leader, vocalist and guitarist Josh Strawn—is less metallic but nevertheless impressive and important: They both played in the lightly gothic Religious to Damn. That band’s hypnotic rock mirrored, at least in part, Strawn’s chilling post-punk standouts in Blacklist. So, just how intricate and truculent can Vaura be? No matter what the credits might suggest, The Missing—Vaura’s second album in as many years and first for Profound Lore—is not altogether intimidating, either stylistically or technically. Sure, there are blast beats and wave-of-treble black metal guitars. There’s some doom lurch and even a touch of industrial disorientation. And the compositions aren’t exactly simple. “Passage to Vice” is a Rube Goldberg contraption of rhythms, with pianos and drums, guitars and vocals bouncing off of one another at just the right angles and moments to bloom into a chorus. During a late-song break, “Incomplete Burning” sprints down a spiral staircase of complication, colorful riffs wrapping like quickly growing vines around the structure. The eight-minute closer moves through slinking post-rock and pulsing New Wave, with Strawn lifting lyrics liberally from Ovid’s Metamorphoses. But there’s a core of incandescent pop at the center of The Missing, too, an anchor that pulls its songs together as Vaura bridges post-punk and black metal, feathered atmospherics and cavalier dexterity. Though The Missing is intense enough to remind you of its members’ respective histories, it is at times disarmingly catchy and surprisingly bright. There’s perhaps no better summary of Vaura’s success here than “Passage to Vice”, a tune so metrically poised that every piece seems to move in reaction to another. But Strawn speak-sings his way through the verses and stretches out in the hooks. He handles the words with the sort of cool aplomb that suggests the best work of Pinback. Gloom notwithstanding, you’ll want to follow him through the various slinks and soars, to sing along. And there’s “The Fire”, which shrieks open after a lengthy introduction with the most aggressive guitar layers and drum blitzes on the album. The beat is heavy during the verses, but it flares upward as it enters the chorus, dual guitars retrenching the obsidian escalation—that is, the parts you’d normally expect to be the most abrasive and potentially off-putting only bolster Strawn’s exquisite refrain. It’s not a novel technique, as you can hear similar moves from most every atmospheric black metal act. It does, however, illustrate Vaura’s aim of accessibility on The Missing. Alternately, “Incomplete Burning” eases up on its torrent of drums and guitars as it enters the chorus, finding an unexpected middle point between metal and mid-90s college rock. It does not sound altogether unlike the Gin Blossoms’ “Hey Jealousy”. Selenelion, Vaura’s very good 2012 debut, was a touch longer than The Missing, in part because it incorporated more disparate elements. There was downtrodden folk and a little Sonic Youth-style squall, unabashed deathrock homage, and a touch of tech-metal maul. It felt almost like a DJ mix of its members’ interests, pivoting from one look to another competently, but without too much worry about making it all work as a whole. The Missing not only better integrates these elements but dispatches with some of the more superfluous ones. There’s no folksy interlude, and there are no unnecessary solos. As the record pushes toward its more doleful back half, Strawn’s gothic past wedges toward the spotlight, especially on the excellent and gray “The Things That We All Hide”. It doesn’t feel abrupt. Rather, without those previous distractions, all of these pieces fit into a more cohesive picture, and the melodies ring out that much clearer. Watching the rollout of reactions to The Missing has offered an intriguing look at the expectations placed upon artists because of their past. To wit, Metal Sucks dismissed The Missing outright for its seeming omission of heaviness, decrying its “fake smoke and eyeliner, lacking any of the blood and sweat and grit that infuses raw life into metal.” But at Echoes and Dust, a reviewer commended the hints of the National and U2 nestled into its heaviness. Writing for Decibel, Adrien Begrand lauded its ambitious mix of post-punk and black metal and Strawn’s “high-gloss 1986-87” gothic tendencies. He called it a “challenging listen,” though, but here I am mentioning Armistead Burwell Smith IV, the Gin Blossoms, and Mogwai. The Missing, then, seems like a meticulous collage, where the parts that mean the most to you are the parts you’ll find the fastest. Maybe there won’t be enough metal or enough solos or enough eyeliner, or maybe there will be too much of all of it. I sometimes wish it dipped down into mid-tempo trods a bit less. Still, on The Missing, Vaura’s stylistic composite is decisive and deliberate, putting those pedigrees to use in a surprising and somehow entirely sensible fashion.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18545-vaura-the-missing/,Profound Lore,2013.0,"The Missing by Vaura - An Ethereal Journey Through Soundscapes

Vaura is a band that manages to blend a number of different genres together while still offering cohesive and inviting soundscapes. The Missing is their latest album, which takes the listener on a journey through unique and mesmerizing nan sounds that never fail to impress.

The band has a deeply-rooted history in the music world, with members who have previously played with notable outfits such as Tombs, Kayo Dot, Dysrhythmia and Gorguts. With a diverse array of influences, it's easy to see how Vaura manages to explore different soundscapes through their music.

The Missing was born out of a collaborative effort within the band. Vaura spent a lot of time experimenting with unique sounds and instrumentation in creating the album. The band has managed to create a cohesive narrative across the record, with each track flowing seamlessly into the other. The collective effort of the group is evident in the attention to detail and the quality of the compositions.

As for the music itself, The Missing is a beautifully crafted album that explores the nuances of nan. The opening track, “Espionage” immediately sets the tone for the album. The ethereal synths create a dream-like soundscape, while the drums and bass set a steady and hypnotic pace. The vocals add yet another layer of otherworldliness, making it easy to get lost within the song.

One of the standout tracks on the album is “The Ruins (Hymne)” which features a striking and memorable combination of baritone vocals and piercing guitar tones. It's an intense moment of sonic beauty that the band has crafted masterfully.

The album closes with “Sables” which features stripped-back instrumentation, enriching the listeners with an intimate and mellow musical experience. The track feels like a fitting conclusion after the trip that we have been on throughout The Missing's nine tracks.

Overall, The Missing is an album that has something to offer for any lover of nan or experimental music. Its beauty lies in the ability of Vaura to fully immerse the listener in the ethereal soundscapes, which are intriguing and exciting at every turn. With a rating of 7.5/10, The Missing is a must-listen for anyone seeking to be taken on a journey of the senses.","1.

Phish,Big Boat,Rock,5.3,October 7 2016,Sam Sodomsky,Associate Staff Writer,"The best of Phish’s music aims for transcendence. It’s at the heart of any jam band, or really, any kind of improvisatory outfit: an attempt to find language beyond language, to go somewhere you could not go alone. It’s why the length of any given Phish song in concert might stretch deep into the double-digits, and why their loyal legion of fans feel an instinctual desire to see as many of their shows as possible. Despite their massive audience, Phish remain a countercultural force, and their goofy, shroomy jams resonate as an aural rejection of the monotonous sobriety of suburban adolescence. For much of Phish’s fans, the band is akin to the class clown who’s also the smartest kid in the room. Their energy is infectious and vital; when you’re with them, you feel better about yourself. It’s an escapist fantasy. On Big Boat, the band’s thirteenth album, Phish openly promise salvation from the get-go. In “Friends,” the dumb-as-rocks, vaguely triumphant opening number, drummer Jon Fishman forecasts the coming of the Lord, descending upon the Earth in “some fiery fashion.” But Fishman offers an alternate exit, escaping to the hills and collecting his like-minded compatriots aboard the titular “big boat.” As an opener, it offers a mission statement not dissimilar to My Morning Jacket’s “Victory Dance,” an enthusiastic, if overly simplistic song aimed squarely at the already-initiated. Keyboardist Page McConnell bashes dramatically along his keyboard, like a parody of Roy Bittan on Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell, as Fishman’s toms roll and Trey Anastasio’s fingers glide along his fretboard. Incessant and noisy, “Friends” opens Big Boat with the promise of a Phish album armed with purpose and energy. That is not the album that follows. Big Boat is at times overwrought and half-assed, gratingly silly and embarrassingly self-serious, both tedious and underwhelming. In other words, it’s a new Phish album. Even still, the lowest points of Big Boat manage to sink lower than just being bad-for-Phish; Big Boat is made even worse by not sounding *enough *like Phish. The turgid prog-pop of “Waking Up Dead” could be mistaken for any number of anonymous, post-Phish, local jam acts. “Tide Turns,” with its nauseating Jimmy Buffett sleaze, doesn’t even fail for Phish trying to sound like a soul group; it’s more akin to members of Phish begrudgingly joining a wedding band. Somewhere along the way, you get your expected share of underwritten ballads, overly complicated funk wipeouts, and multiple tracks whose runtimes come suspiciously close to the 4:20 mark. If you love Phish, the release of a solid studio album has likely never been a requirement to stay onboard, even when their releases were fun and relatively consistent, like 1996’s Billy Breathes. Had Big Boat never been released, the live staple “Blaze On” would still find its way to their blissed-out crowds, as it has on the last several tours. And while “Blaze On” is no latter-day classic like, say, “So Many Roads,” its inclusion here and on their setlist does represent an example of Phish updating their repertoire without resorting to the tried-and-true album-and-single cycles they’ve always existed squarely outside of. As such, Phish exist in a number gray areas. They are an indie-minded band with mainstream appeal; a classic rock group who rejects the genre’s radio-focused populism; an enormously competent outfit who use their expertise to promote their euphoric brand of anti-intellectualism. If Phish were to embrace their unique position in the industry, one could imagine them penning albums that were, if not definitive, then at least approaching coherence, like modern-day Wilco, or Phish tourmates Ween. Instead, *Big Boat *is another failure in a discography full of them. Without a unifying identity, it whiffs on nearly every statement it tries to make. For a group of musicians whose sole value has always been the simple pleasure of making music, the members of Phish sound noticeably vacant in these recordings. Still, none of the album’s weaknesses (like McConnell rhyming “losing my interest” with “just scanning Pinterest”) would be half as disappointing if Phish weren’t almost aging gracefully. The last several years have had some undeniable high points—from the simple, nostalgic rock of 2009’s *Joy *through 2014’s Fuego, easily the band’s most inspired record since the ’90s. On Big Boat, they come up with a few winning moments. Trey’s guitar solos throughout the otherwise rote balladry of “Miss You” are genuinely moving in a way his humdrum vocals and plainspoken lyrics could never be. McConnell’s “I Always Wanted It This Way” is the album’s peak, a defiant Motorik jam that wouldn’t sound out of place on a 21st-century Yo La Tengo album. The album closes strikingly with “Petrichor,” an immaculately arranged prog opus. It might not be a track to convince the naysayers (or even, with its thirteen-minute runtime, to necessarily warrant a second play). But it’s the only moment on the album when Phish shows—and not just tells—that transcendence is possible, and that they’re willing to go there with us.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22451-big-boat/,Jemp,2016.0,"Hey there music lovers! Today, we'll be diving into the world of rock with Phish's latest album, 'Big Boat'. At first glance, the rating might not seem too impressive (5.3 out of 10), but don't let that discourage you. This album has much more to offer than just a number.

First, let's take a quick look at Phish's history. The band formed in 1983, in Burlington, Vermont, and has been a beloved staple in the world of jam bands ever since. Phish is known for their improvisational live performances, intricate musical arrangements, and impressive fanbase. In fact, they're one of the highest-grossing bands of all time, and have sold out Madison Square Garden over 50 times. They've also had a rocky journey, with hiatuses and lineup changes, but have maintained a loyal following throughout the years.

Now, onto 'Big Boat'. This album was released in 2016, and features 13 tracks that showcase Phish's musical range. From the upbeat and catchy 'Breath and Burning', to the mellow and introspective 'Miss You', 'Big Boat' draws from a variety of genres and emotions. This album also has a strong lyrical focus, with many songs examining common themes such as love, loss, and self-discovery.

Personally, I found 'Big Boat' to be a refreshing listen. As someone who was not previously familiar with Phish's music, I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity of the tracks, and the technical musicianship of the band members. Each song felt like a journey, with twists and turns that kept me engaged throughout.

One standout track for me was 'Blaze On'. This song features a funky, groovy beat that's impossible not to bop along to. The lyrics are simple but effective, encouraging the listener to let go of their worries and dance the night away. It's the perfect summer anthem, and feels like it could easily become a Phish classic.

Overall, while 'Big Boat' may not be Phish's most groundbreaking or innovative album, it's still a solid addition to their discography. The band's talent and passion shines through in each track, and the album as a whole is a cohesive and enjoyable listen. So if you're a fan of rock, or just looking for some new music to check out, give 'Big Boat' a chance. Who knows, it might just be the perfect soundtrack to your summer days and summer nights.","1.

Lapalux,Nostalchic,Electronic,7.4,March 28 2013,Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,"Lapalux stands out as one of the more accessible producers on Flying Lotus’s Brainfeeder label, making music that skews closer to pop than much of the hybridized production the label is known for. The Essex native, born Stuart Howard, showed himself to be a savvy deconstructionist on a pair of 2012 EPs. He took the raw ingredients of offbeat pop songs--melodic backbone, diaphonous vocals, clattering drumlines-- and shuffled them to create IDM tracks that felt inventive and accessible. He's using similar tricks on his debut album Nostalchic, while moving from deconstructed pop to a more relaxed brand of R&B and soul, both genres that complement Howard's consistent interest in texture. On Lapalux’s first two Brainfeeder projects, When You’re Gone and Some Other Time, you could hear the 25-year old producer cautiously experimenting with new ideas, working within traditional structures even as he experimented with outré sounds. He’s more confident on Nostalchic, walking the line between chaos and stability to create a sound that resembles a jittery, discombobulated version of chillwave. Brainfeeder's Hip-Hop Beats N' Bass blueprint is still present, but it isn't the focus on the album. Instead, on tracks like the back-to-back standouts ""Flower"" and ""Swallowing Smoke"", Howard's working with a hundred little slivers of the same core melody, rearranging them again and again by attaching them to different portions of the beat until, by the end of the song, they fit together smoothly. It's sampling as fine art-- as precise and painstaking as a mosaic. With all these separate elements floating around, it's possible for things to get a little too messy. ""Kelly Brook"" is muddled and unpleasant, shot through with sounds that don't make sense with each other. It's as if the pieces of several different songs were never properly separated and it’s one of the few moments on the album where Howard doesn’t appear to be in total control. Vocalists appear throughout Nostalchic, serving as amplified versions of their sampled counterparts from the guest-free tracks. Though Jenna Andrews has a strong showing on the languorous “One Thing” and Kerry Leatham’s distorted voice adds depth to the standout “Without You”, Lapalux is actually his own most reliable performer. On “Walking Words” he's familiar enough with the beat to insert what sounds like his own murmurs and distortion directly into the spaces available and his vocal ends up mimicking the track's motion perfectly. With a name like Nostalchic, you might assume that Howard is trying to conjure something from the past, to produce the sonic equivalent of immaculate vintage clothing. The sentiments expressed on the album are in keeping with that concept: the lyrics, where they exist, tend to keep things simple with messages like “Do you want to dance?” and “I want to make love.” But, keeping solidly in line with the Brainfeeder tradition, Nostalchic is a forward-looking album, warm and comfortable but never obvious.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17795-lapalux-nostalchic/,Brainfeeder,2013.0,"Lapalux's Nostalchic: Let the Music Take You on a Journey

Electronic music has been a mainstay in the music industry for years. But it's rare to find electronic music that tells a story, that takes you on a journey. Enter Lapalux and their album Nostalchic. 

With a rating of 7.4 out of 10, Nostalchic delivers an immersive experience. But before we dive into the music, let's take a brief look at Lapalux and how the album came to be. 

Lapalux, aka Stuart Howard, hails from the UK and has been creating electronic music for over a decade. His sound is a fusion of various genres, including IDM, hip hop, and R&B. With Nostalchic, Lapalux aimed to create an album that captured the feeling of nostalgia, an emotion that we all experience at some point in our lives. 

The album starts with ""IAMSYS"", a slow-building track that sets the tone for the remainder of the album. As each track unfolds, you can't help but feel that you're on a journey. ""Guuurl"" and ""One Thing"" are standout tracks that showcase Lapalux's ability to mix various sounds and genres seamlessly. ""Swallowing Smoke"" is another gem that flips between an eerie piano melody and a bass-heavy beat. 

Personal favorite ""Without You"" features vocals from Kerry Leatham that provide a haunting element to the track. The contrast between the peaceful instrumental and the emotive vocals results in a powerful, almost hypnotic sound. 

As the album progresses, you start to feel a sense of melancholy, which is perfectly captured in ""Kelly Brook"". It's a track that feels like a hug, a comforting embrace that tells you that it's okay to feel sad sometimes. 

The album ends with ""Strangling You With the Cord"", a track that's as dark as its name suggests. But even in its darkness, there's a sense of hope. The sound slowly fades away, leaving you with a feeling of contentment. 

Overall, Lapalux's Nostalchic is a journey worth taking. It's an album that captures the feeling of nostalgia in a way that's both familiar and fresh. Lapalux has created a sound that's uniquely his own, and Nostalchic is a testament to his talent. If you're looking for electronic music that tells a story, that takes you on a journey, you can't go wrong with this album.","1.

Fe-Mail,Syklubb fra Hælvete,Experimental,7.7,June 13 2004,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Fe-Mail are Maja Ratkje and Hild Sofie Tafjord, both formerly of the Norwegian experimental electro-acoustic quartet Spunk. You might also know Ratkje from her exceptional 2002 solo album Voice, on which she demonstrated how the bizarre fury of a woman scorned could produce as intimidating, recklessly creative storm as any force in nature. Only, she didn't actually seem scorned; her solo work, and that with Fe-Mail, can be abrasive, but in general seems more the work of someone who takes more than a little pride in fucking with people. The duo's music, represented on 2003's Syklubb fra Hælvete and the new All Men Are Pigs, can seem an exercise in pushing buttons-- and not necessarily just the electronic kind. Apparently, Fe-Mail want to see just how far they can lead me into a semi-chaotic world, daring me to lean in closer so they can pounce with industrial loops and howling electronic screams. Surprising, then, to discover that their brand of noise (Merzbow is a better point of reference than any of their peers at Rune Grammofon) is so fetching. Living up to the questionable pun of their moniker, Fe-Mail delight in using images of female sexuality and glamour to contrast the iron-fisted free terror of their music. They pose as calendar models on their album covers-- or use Rik Rawling's lurid cartoons fusing softcore porn with heavy artillery-- and seem only too happy to exploit their rather attractive competitive advantage. I get the feeling they're trying to tell me something, too, be it an ironic statement about improvised noise music, or just a kiss-off to all the hipster chauvinists of the world. Regardless of the concept, Syklubb and All Men deliver on purely musical fronts in spades, so you don't need to feel very guilty for having a nagging urge to stare at the CD jackets. Syklubb was originally released in an edition of 500 on pink vinyl in Norway last year. The Important Records CD reissue contains two tracks not on the original, ""Virus Attachment 1"" and ""Virus Attachment 2"". These pieces foreshadow the near-violent thrust of All Men, and are in considerable contrast with much of Syklubb. The former begins with a brief exposition of birdsong, but soon initiates a loop of cut-up, high-pitched vocals and distorted percussion. The sound is not unlike recent outings by New York's Black Dice, using metallic, muscular sounds to construct highly detailed noisescapes. ""Jacob's Toy"" is much less confrontational: Atmospheric ambience, provided by who knows what analog synthesizer or manipulated field recording, sets up a mildly disorientating vocal section that alternates spoken word with wildly altered screams and laughs. Fe-Mail use the human voice as source material rather than a lead instrument, though it invariably lends acoustic warmth to their music. Since much of Fe-Mail's music is improvised, it's not surprising to hear it run through several seemingly unrelated textures within a piece. ""Water Music"" is the calmest track on Syklubb, but even with layers of natural ambience and water effects, the sine tones and suffocating vocal loop (not to mention spooky, discordant piano) lends it a disturbing quality. Likewise, ""Modogin"" begins as relatively low-key exercise in electro-acoustic minimalism, using what sounds like sandpaper and a plaintive, wordless vocal melody to orchestrate a damaged aria. However, the uneasy peace is broken with a gurgling generator in the left speaker, and a jagged, ferocious roar in the right. And ""jagged"" seems like the right word for Fe-Mail; a topographical diagram of their music would return severe spikes in mood, texture and volume. All Men Are Pigs was recorded with photographer and noise musician Lasse Marhaug, and serves as a pretty good ""fuck you"" to anyone expecting shyer music. If Syklubb had been a study in varying shades of noise, this one is outright terror. Grating, overdriven fuzz swirls through pieces that mix bits of sampled metal guitar and radio static into a single, continuous strip of blades. Rarely, as on ""Here's That Rainy Day, Sid Hendrix' Last Grunt"", the storm subsides into smaller pockets, though most of All Men seems designed to push listeners accustomed to ""lighter"" structures to their breaking points. Of course, this is what makes All Men such a captivating listen. Rather than milk the fury until it no longer has any impact, Fe-Mail know just when to say ""when,"" and how to frame chaos in the barest skeleton so as to suggest that what is happening isn't strictly chaotic, but a spiky, ill-tempered tone poem. The surreal, nightmarish collages at the outset of ""Charmed"" seem to logically prepare me for the paranoid apocalypse of its conclusion; the future-jungle calls of ""Fresh from the Flesh, On a Bed of Roses"" sound like perfect foils for its percussive gearshift loop and maniacal guitar. During a time when many noise and electronic musicians are downsizing to laptops and minimal improvisation, it's refreshing to hear an outfit that has little-to-no appreciation for respectable expectations.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11745-syklubb-fra-hlvete-all-men-are-pigs/,"TV5,TV5",2003.0,"Have you ever heard an album that leaves you completely blown away? One that is so experimental and unique that you can't help but listen to it over and over again? That's exactly how I felt after diving into Fe-Mail's 'Syklubb fra Hælvete'.

Before diving into the album itself though, let's take a look at the band's history. Fe-Mail is a Norwegian experimental noise duo consisting of Maja Ratkje and Hild Sofie Tafjord. Both women have been pioneers in the experimental music scene for years, with Tafjord being a founding member of the avant-garde music group SPUNK, and Ratkje having worked on numerous projects ranging from improvisation to electronic music. They have been collaborating since 2000 as Fe-Mail, and 'Syklubb fra Hælvete' marks their third studio album. 

Now onto the album itself. 'Syklubb fra Hælvete' is a collection of tracks that take listeners on a journey through an otherworldly soundscape. The use of traditional instruments like saxophones and flutes alongside electronic manipulation creates a sound that is entirely unique to Fe-Mail. The opener ""Geometrisk Krig"" immediately sets the tone for the rest of the album with its use of harsh noise and eerie synths. There's a clear sense of chaos in tracks like ""Esoterisk Elektronikk"" and ""Primitiv Bar Hopping"", but it's a chaos that is completely controlled by Ratkje and Tafjord.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Pyromantikk"". The use of brass instruments gives the track a grandiose feel, but at the same time, it's contrasted with harsh noise that keeps it grounded in the experimental genre. It's an example of how Fe-Mail can take seemingly disparate elements and blend them together seamlessly. 

The album's title, which translates to ""Bicycle Club from Hell"", is no coincidence. Fe-Mail creates a soundscape that is both beautiful and haunting, like a ride through an abandoned amusement park. While some may find the album too abrasive or unapproachable, I found it to be a refreshing departure from the conventional norms of music. 

At the end of the day, 'Syklubb fra Hælvete' is a testament to Fe-Mail's ability to push boundaries and create music that is truly unique. This album is not for the faint of heart, but for those who are willing to take the plunge, it's an experience unlike any other. With its clever use of traditional instruments and electronic manipulation, Fe-Mail has created a sound that is entirely their own. I give 'Syklubb fra Hælvete' a well-deserved rating of 7.7 out of 10.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed than Review B.

Islands,Should I Remain Here at Sea?,Rock,7.4,May 26 2016,Pat Healy,Contributor,"Nick Thorburn’s music has been downloaded more than 80 million times in the past two years, but a majority of those people will likely always associate his work with a girl who can’t pronounce the phrase “MailChimp.” In a perfect world, the two albums his band Islands have simultaneously released would change that. *Taste *and Should I Remain Here at Sea? * *are Islands’ first releases since 2013. In the intervening years, Thorburn busied himself by composing for the podcast, Serial, including the tinny minor-chord piano theme that starts each episode. That his band has released these somewhat-different albums on the same day should come as no surprise to those familiar with Thorburn’s output. After coming to prominence as a leading force in the Unicorns, a band that arguably helped lift indie rock out of a self-serious rut in 2003, he formed Islands, as well as several other projects that blur the line between serious and silly, including Mister Heavenly, Th’ Corn Gangg, Reefer, and Human Highway. To say nothing of his solo work that he releases as Nick Diamonds. Basically, he is a compulsive music maker, and his foray into soundtracking the most popular podcast ever made him antsy to get back to Islands. It also seems to have focused him. *Taste *is a largely electronic affair, while Should I Remain Here at Sea? * *is more guitar-based. But it’s not their instrumentation that gives these albums their distinct personalities. The recording notes show that the band switched between working on Taste and *Should I Remain... *for bursts, completing both within a few months of each other. The resulting two albums seem to offer two ways of dealing with personal devastation: for the first few days you try to make sense of it all while talking to those who are close to you. The wounds are still fresh and you can only speak of it with an air of gravitas. A few days later and you’re able to gain some perspective on the event and perhaps even make light of it. Taste is the bitter sharp-witted album immediately dealing with the fallout. *Should I Remain… *is lighter, looser and more concise, in the same way that you refine your story once you’ve tried telling it a few times. There’s a heavy theme of a fracturing relationship on both albums, as well as unlikely recurrences of fierce gripes about American cops and benign complaints about California weather. These releases are also united in their robust choruses, which could get stadiums to sing along if Thorburn dumbed it down and wrote more formulaically. But that’s not in his nature: He’s not aggressively courting those millions of Serial listeners. Thorburn’s greatest skill is creating subliminal hooks that will stay with you even if you didn’t notice them at first. A lyrical line will swim around in your head until it offers an unexpected truth, like the advice he offers about dealing with personal tragedies soberly: “Turn to face it, resist the narcotic embrace,” he sings in Taste’s lead single, “Charm Offensive.” It’s the type of line that will come floating to the front of consciousness when you’re thinking about throwing up your hands and giving into your worst impulses. While Islands have gotten progressively more serious with each release, the band do still know how to keep proceedings from getting too staid. A tap dance solo highlights “Stop Me Now” on Should I Remain…, the whistle line from “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly” finds its way into “The Joke,” and one of the most exquisite songs in the collection is given the irreverent title of “Outspoken Dirtbiker.” As far as absurd titles go, it’s no “Don’t Call Me Whitney, Bobby,” but it does showcase Thorburn’s ability to keep his sense of humor when dealing with weighty issues. The band is in top form here. On both albums, Thorburn shares producer credit with bassist Evan Gordon, who is also responsible for the programming. The uneasy beats on Taste are part of what give that album its kick. Guitarist Geordie Gordon and drummer Adam Halferty also make both albums richer by providing dense textures and strong background vocals. Should I Remain Here at Sea? has the feel of friends blowing off steam the only way they know how, after working so hard on something outside of their comfort zone. The process of the band working through Taste together has united them in this shared experience, and they rock out accordingly on “Back Into It,” the track that opens *Should I Remain… * This relationship between records makes Islands’ induction to the Two-Separate-Releases-at-the-Same-Time Club a different proposition than more famous double offerings from Guns N’ Roses, Bruce Springsteen, Paul Westerberg, and Bright Eyes. Of course, when all of those acts did it, we weren’t living in the streaming society we are now, and I’d be writing this review to tell you which one of these is more worth your money. For the most part, it’s now just a matter of which one is worth your time, and they both are. These albums may be decidedly separate, but they’re only complete when experienced together.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21955-tasteshould-i-remain-here-at-sea/,"Manqué,Manqué",2016.0,"Islands’ latest foray into the world of rock music, ‘Should I Remain Here at Sea?’ is a captivating, layered album that showcases the band’s unique style and versatility. As a long-time fan of their music, I was excited to see where they would take their sound next, and I was not disappointed.

For those unfamiliar with the band, Islands was formed in 2006 by former member of The Unicorns, Nick Diamonds, and multi-instrumentalist Jamie Thompson. Since then, the band has gone through multiple line-up changes, and the current iteration includes Diamonds, Thompson, Evan Gordon, Geordie Gordon, and Adam Halferty.

‘Should I Remain Here at Sea?’ was recorded in a remote cabin on a small island off the coast of British Columbia, which likely contributed to the album’s introspective, atmospheric quality. The band has described the album as a concept record about “emotional struggle” and “the search for a sense of purpose.” This thematic thread is woven throughout the album’s 11 tracks, lending the overall listening experience a sense of cohesion and narrative arc.

From opener “Charm Offensive” to closer “Fear,” each track offers a unique perspective on these universal themes. The instrumentation is consistently tight and inventive, with Diamonds’ and Gordon’s guitars weaving intricate melodies and Thompson’s inventive keyboard and percussion work providing a strong foundation for the songs.

Personal highlights for me include the upbeat, infectious “Back Into It,” the dreamy ballad “Fear,” and the haunting “The Joke,” which features stunning vocal harmonies and a truly mesmerizing guitar solo. Although the album doesn’t necessarily break any new ground in terms of genre, Islands’ ability to channel their influences into a cohesive, original sound is truly impressive.

Overall, ‘Should I Remain Here at Sea?’ is an excellent addition to Islands’ discography, and a must-listen for fans of the band and the rock genre. While not a perfect album, it showcases the band’s continued growth and evolution over the years, and proves that they are still a force to be reckoned with in the indie rock scene.","1.

Atlas Sound,"Bedroom Databank, Vols. 1-4",Rock,6.4,January 12 2011,Joe Colly,Contributor,"Back before we could follow an artist's every move on Twitter, Bradford Cox was life-streaming on his band's blog, generously offering demos, mixtapes, rants, and a look inside his creative process. That mostly came to an end after the Microcastle leak turned ugly, when the previously fun back-and-forth between Cox and fans became, for him, a burden or cause of personal anxiety. Can't blame the guy: If you've ever been caught up in Internet drama, you know how shitty it feels. But Cox is still an incredibly prolific musician, and every now and again he logs onto the old site and dumps a whole heap of unreleased tracks for fans to enjoy. This is one of the great things about Internet-era listening: Instead of waiting around for months for your favorite band to drop another label album, one morning you wake up and you've got two and a half hours' worth of brand-new material to sort through. It can also be overwhelming, of course, because when the new-music faucet never shuts off, you're constantly playing catch-up. This volume of songs from Cox's Atlas Sound guise pretty much typifies that feeling of music overload-- some of it's great, some of it isn't, and you have to show a good amount of patience to sift through it all in order to find the gems. Recorded over 2010 at Cox's home and in his band's Notown studio in Atlanta, Bedroom Databank is four albums' worth of tossed-off ditties and more fully fleshed-out demos. Sonically, the collection runs from straightforward folk-pop to electronic instrumentals and songs that fall somewhere in between. The folk element is one of the first things that stands out: Generally, we think of Cox as a boundary pusher (and he is), but the more music we hear from him, the more he also comes across like a traditional singer-songwriter who really loves Bob Dylan and Neil Young. About half of this set consists of simple, waltz-time ballads recorded with a harmonica and acoustic guitar. The cool thing about these country-tinged numbers is that they put Cox's lyrical content right out in the open. He's obscured words in noise and reverb plenty in the past, but he's a better songwriter than he often gets credit for, and here we get a clearer look at that part of his work. Favoring cryptic turns of phrase over straightforward storytelling, he sings about mundane stuff like getting older and more jaded in a way that makes it feel emotionally rich and sometimes very sad. The track ""New Romantic"" is an example: ""Please don't forget your hometown/ You used to see your friends/ You used to have good friends."" Or ""How to Pass the Time"", which has a similar loss-of-innocence theme: ""Your laughter used to ring out so loud/ Why can't you remember that now?"" The rest of the music on Bedroom Databank focuses on Cox's production skill, which is as sharp as ever when he wants it to be. There are Budd/Eno ambient instrumentals and some of the glitchier haze-pop from the previous Atlas Sound LPs. I'm always impressed at how he injects emotion into these things-- a song like ""Heatwave"" is just an airy wisp at first glance, but with atonal touches and looped-over guitars he makes it feel like more, something like the last seconds of a flickering daydream. As for the mixed-genre stuff, he does it better than most any bedroom producer futzing around with post-Panda Bear textures. Something like ""Wild Love"", which was probably recorded in about 15 minutes, makes all the hypnagogic pop in the world sound pretty uninspired by comparison. But I'm mostly talking highlights here, and there are plenty of songs that are less worthy of your time. It's not one disc or the other, since there's good material scattered throughout, but generally I'd say Volumes 2 and 3 are the least essential. This is where Cox is the least focused, laying down woozy song sketches and flimsy instrumentals that seem designed more for his pleasure than his fans'. Tracks like ""Pilot Light"" and ""Crossriver"" you can hear once and comfortably not revisit. But that's the nature of this collection: It's very much a grab bag. The reason it's ultimately worth doing the digging, though, is Cox-- one of indie's most fascinating characters and a guy that just has music pouring out of him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14996-bedroom-databank-vols-1-4/,Self-released,2010.0,"If you're in need of a dreamy and introspective soundtrack, then look no further than ""Bedroom Databank, Vols. 1-4"" by Atlas Sound. Frontman Bradford Cox has been making music as Atlas Sound since the mid-2000s, and this album showcases the band's creative evolution and artistic exploration.

The ""Bedroom Databank"" series consists of four volumes, each with a distinct feel and mood. The songs feel like sprawling experimental soundscapes, with Cox's ethereal vocals hovering above the dreamlike instrumentals. There's a sense of vulnerability and intimacy that flows throughout the album, created in part by the lo-fi production and the personal anecdotes that Cox weaves into the lyrics.

What's remarkable about this album is the way that Cox plays with different genres and influences. There are moments that feel like shoegaze, with layers of distortion and reverb building up to a wall of sound. Other tracks have a more straightforward rock sound, with catchy hooks and driving rhythms. And yet, despite these disparate elements, the album maintains a cohesive and immersive vibe.

One of the standout tracks is ""Mona Lisa,"" a slow-burning ballad that builds to a heart-wrenching climax. Cox's voice is plaintive and emotional, conveying a deep sense of longing and nostalgia. It's a highlight of the album, and a testament to Cox's ability to craft a powerful and moving song.

Personally, ""Bedroom Databank, Vols. 1-4"" has been a constant presence on my playlists since its release. There's something deeply comforting about the way that Cox's music washes over you, like a warm wave of sound. As someone who struggles with anxiety and insomnia, I find that this album has a soothing and meditative quality that helps me unwind and relax.

Overall, I would highly recommend ""Bedroom Databank, Vols. 1-4"" to anyone looking for a unique and creative take on rock music. It's an introspective and immersive album, one that rewards multiple listens and closer examination. While it may not be for everyone, I believe that those who take the time to delve into its lush soundscapes will find a lot to love.","1.

Pink Floyd,The Early Years 1965-1972,Rock,8.8,December 14 2016,Jesse Jarnow,Contributor,"“Today’s underground may be the answer to tomorrow’s leisure,” intones an earnest British newscaster, narrating film of London’s U.F.O. Club circa January 1967 while its house band, Pink Floyd, jams amid the flashing lights. And darned if he wasn’t right: the black-and-white segment is now found on the massive new $550, 11-CD/9-DVD/8 Blu-Ray box set, Pink Floyd: The Early Years, 1965–1972. With over 27 hours of material, the package overflows with replica 45 rpm singles, gig flyers, posters, tickets, sheet music, and more, and the ark-like box should provide serious leisure-time satisfaction for both longtime Floyd freaks and aspiring heads alike. The Early Years tells the remarkable story of Pink Floyd’s career up through the moment they became part of yesterday’s underground and today’s mainstream, stopping just before the writing and recording of 1973’s Dark Side of the Moon. Charting the band’s progression from the wig-flipping baroque psychedelia of Syd Barrett’s songwriting through their wooliest jams and into the new space beyond, The Early Years doesn’t follow a straight path. It shows an astonishing capacity to turn corners and evolve, a long arc that might give hope to every band jamming away in its practice space in search of a voice. Beginning as a blues combo with the perfectly British drug-punning name the Tea Set (“tea” being slang for weed, maaaan), the band rechristened themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound by the time of the 1965 demo sessions that open the box’s first disc. Though not particularly competent or interesting R&B players, as demonstrated by their cover of Slim Harpo’s “I’m a King Bee” just as much as an untitled 1968 “Blues Jam” on a later disc, it’s fascinating to hear Barrett’s already distinctly bent rhythm guitar as filtered through the Bo Diddley beat of “Double O Bo.” Unheard before being released in 2015 as a double 7"" for Record Store Day, the 1965 sessions also highlight the first fruits of Barrett’s songwriting, the playfulness of “Butterfly” displaying the stylist and singer he already was. “Along with Anthony Newley, he was the first guy I’d heard to sing pop or rock with a British accent,” David Bowie would say of Barrett, a madcap permission-granter for a new generation of British musicians less beholden to imitating their American heroes. Leaving the band in a haze of mental health issues in early 1968, Barrett’s legend would loom over the quartet for years. On the set’s volume from that year, titled Germin/Ation, Floyd’s earliest songwriting without their former leader sounds like a drab imitation, with keyboardist Rick Wright’s “It Would Be So Nice” anticipating the B-list ’60s twee-pop parodied by Spinal Tap on “Cups and Cakes.” Instead, Floyd would start to find themselves in the deep space of their early jam centerpiece, “Interstellar Overdrive,” the nearly 10-minute freak-out that closed their 1967 debut and whose descending chromatic riff dropped them into the beyond. With seven versions on the set, including a devastatingly weird DVD/Blu Ray-only 1969 take of the later slower arrangement featuring Frank Zappa on guitar, the song would provide the first portal for the band’s furthest explorations. (One of the set’s few big bummers is that it doesn’t offer audio-only downloads of the live performances featured on the visual discs.) For fans of Floyd’s experimental tendencies, The Early Years offers enormous fun, beginning with a never-bootlegged soundtrack session. Recorded by the Barrett-era lineup in October 1967 to accompany an abstract film by John Latham, the nine takes are all light show swirl, star-splatter guitar, and primitively convincing free drumming by Nick Mason. And though, later on, Barrett replacement David Gilmour would rightly become known as a guitar hero, his playing throughout The Early Years is judicious when it comes to solos. Wailing some tasty space-blues on “Careful With That Axe, Eugene” during a jam-heavy August 1969 set from Amsterdam and a blistering “Atom Heart Mother” from Montreux ’70, Gilmour just as often fits into the band’s tapestry of gentle cymbal taps and moody keyboard filigrees. Where their American countercultural cousins in the Grateful Dead found mind-manifesting wonder in their musical interpretation of cosmic space, the Floyd more often channeled the cold vacuum and existential tedium, perhaps a reflection of the post-psychedelic fate of Barrett. “Moonhead,” their soundtrack to the Moon landing performed live on BBC TV and captured on Bonus Continu*/Ation*, is a deliberate controlled float, more proto-symphonic than hippie jam. It’s this questioning sadness that the band starts to tap into during their 1969 sessions, the first mournful strains that would find their fullest expression on Dark Side of the Moon. The watershed event comes when Waters’ “Cymbaline” and “Green is the Colour” and Gilmour’s “The Narrow Way” all first turn up on the box, part of a May 1969 BBC recording for John Peel; it’s one of seven sessions for the DJ, all classic bootlegs in their own right. In slightly different and renamed form, all three songs play a part in one of the box’s most enticing if imperfect pieces: a complete live recording of The Journey and The Man, the band’s first attempt at conceptual suites of music, performed as two halves of a show on several occasions in 1969. Though fans have attempted to reconstruct the performances as though it were a lost album, the actual product includes reworked existing pieces, going back as far as “Pow. R Toc H.,” from their 1967 debut, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, here becoming “The Pink Jungle.” Performed with onstage happenings and fourth-wall-breaking intrusions, the music is a fascinating forerunner to Floyd’s more successful theatrics. With sci-fi noir atmospherics (“The Labyrinths of Auximines”), live musique concrète featuring band-members sawing through wood (“Work”), overblown drum solos in disguise (“Doing It”), as well as genetic connections to the Anglophonic fun of the Syd era (Waters’ “Afternoon,” collected as “Biding My Time” on 1971’s Relics), the two suites are first drafts. That the band scrapped them and moved along to the next ambitious projects in the queue is yet another testament to their developing editing skills. As career periods go, the seven years of Pink Floyd’s Early Years don’t exactly match other intense eras of classic rock creativity, like Bob Dylan from 1961 to 1968 or the Beatles from 1962 to 1969. But this set illustrates something about both Pink Floyd’s own path and the rewards of resilience. While remembered for their outsized onstage gestures like inflatable pigs and the disassembly of a giant wall, the real revelation of The Early Years is to hear exactly how slowly and modestly Pink Floyd came into themselves; despite the scale of their ambition, the box feels less a blueprint than a scale model. While Barrett’s contributions remain singular, the development of the band over these years wasn’t so much genius than inspired workmanship, not all of it successful. David Gilmour’s “Fat Old Sun,” appearing first on a July 1970 Peel session, is less compelling in its 15-minute jammed-out incarnation the following year. “Embryo,” though, develops from a three-minute post-Barrett psych-folk bauble on a 1968 BBC session to a fully realized 10-minute prog arrangement by 1971, the band’s restlessness apparent and worthwhile. There’s plenty to gnaw on, from Barrett’s whimsy to the formless countercultural yearning of the middle years to the emergence of Waters and Gilmour as songwriters to the brilliant suite-making of 1971’s “Echoes.” While the band would shatter amid acrimonious lawsuits a decade after this set’s conclusion, the music is the sound of musicians working in concert towards an unseen and unknown goal. In the modern age of oversized vault-clearing and copyright-protecting box sets, there is something resoundingly human about The Early Years, which only makes the achievements more extraordinary. Concluding with a new mix of 1972’s Obscured by Clouds (excluding bonus material), one can hear all the pieces of their more iconic future albums clicking into place and the sound of space closing around them into something more fixed. But that’s the topic of another box set.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22663-the-early-years-1965-1972/,Legacy,2016.0,"When it comes to Pink Floyd, it's hard not to be a little bit in awe of what they've accomplished. With over five decades in the music industry and over 250 million records sold, they're a band that has made an indelible mark on the rock genre. That's why I was particularly excited to listen to ""The Early Years 1965-1972,"" a retrospective compilation that covers the formative years of the group.

This album is an absolute treasure trove for any Pink Floyd fan, particularly those who are invested in the early days of the band. It's impressive to see how Pink Floyd evolved in just a few short years, transforming from a relatively straightforward blues-rock outfit to the avant-garde experimentalists that we all know and love. And let's not forget about the sheer quality of the music. Even during this early period, it's clear that Pink Floyd had a level of songwriting sophistication that was ahead of its time.

But before I dive into the music itself, let's talk a little bit about the band's history. Pink Floyd got its start in 1965, when guitarist Syd Barrett, bassist Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and keyboardist Richard Wright started playing around the London music scene. The band's early years were marked by a series of singles and live shows, but it wasn't until 1967 that the band truly hit its stride with the release of ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,"" an album that showcased Barrett's unique songwriting abilities and experimental sensibilities.

However, in late 1967, Barrett began to experience significant mental health issues that would ultimately lead to his departure from the band. David Gilmour, another guitarist and friend of the band, was brought on to replace him. From there, Pink Floyd would go on to release a series of groundbreaking albums, including ""Ummagumma,"" ""Atom Heart Mother,"" and ""Meddle,"" before finally solidifying their status as rock legends with the release of ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" in 1973.

""The Early Years 1965-1972"" is a fascinating look at Pink Floyd's evolution during this crucial period in their history. The album collects a wide range of material, from early singles like ""Arnold Layne"" and ""See Emily Play"" to more experimental pieces like ""Interstellar Overdrive"" and ""Astonomy Domine."" It's clear that even during this early period, Pink Floyd was willing to take risks and push the boundaries of what was possible in rock music. 

For me, one of the standout tracks on the album is ""Echoes (Live at Pompeii),"" which features an extended jam that really showcases the band's instrumental chops. The live setting gives the song an added sense of energy, and it's a great reminder of just how animated Pink Floyd could be on stage. The song also highlights the band's mastery of dynamics, moving from quiet and contemplative to loud and bombastic with ease.

Overall, I would highly recommend ""The Early Years 1965-1972"" to any Pink Floyd fan. It's an excellent collection that provides a unique look into the band's formative years, revealing just how much they accomplished in a relatively short amount of time. And even if you're not yet a Pink Floyd fan, this album is a great place to start- it's a reminder of just how dynamic and innovative rock music can be. With a rating of 8.8 out of 10, it's clear that ""The Early Years 1965-1972"" is a must-have for any music lover.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed than Review B.

No. 2,What Does Good Luck Bring?,Pop/R&B,7.0,November 4 2002,Ryan Kearney,,"What do the following have in common? A) No. 2
B) Barry Bonds
C) A brick of hash Give up? The answer, of course, is that all three are pretty damn solid. Now, the connection between that selfish slugger and a hellofalotta hashish is obvious: love 'em or hate 'em, they consistently produce effective, often staggering results-- though you probably wouldn't want to get with (or by) either of them. Plus, you can only really take so much Bonds or hash before you lose your mind. No. 2, a three-man outfit led by former Heatmiser co-songwriter Neil Gust, is a completely different kind of solid. Whereas hash goes up in smoke, and steroids go up in Bonds' ass, there's nothing deceitful about No. 2. Though hardly staggering, their results are always rock-solid and don't require moderation on the listener's part. But therein lies the positive and the negative, wrapped up like yin and yang-- or, better yet, like Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton in Monster's Ball, except not nearly as sexy or fucked up (respectively, of course). What Does Good Luck Bring? exhibits sound songwriting, as one should expect from Gust. His significant contributions to Heatmiser were overshadowed by the later success of his former bandmate, Elliott Smith; their excellent swan song, 1996's Mic City Sons, was as much Gust's child as Smith's. And when Gust released his impressive debut, No Memory, with No. 2 in 1999, his talent was proven. That record was in many ways a continuation of the pop/rock that Heatmiser had perfected, and it never came close to receiving the attention it deserved. Smith, as we all know, went on to become a media darling with his Oscar-nominated contributions to the Good Will Hunting soundtrack. Now he's back to fighting obscurity, where Gust has been all along. Fortunately, though, What Does Good Luck Bring? isn't the sound of a talented songwriter trying to prove himself. No. 2 effortlessly crank out 36 minutes of rock, though with slightly less pop than their earlier work. Frank Black's first couple albums with The Catholics come to mind. These songs are crisp and clean, but they have the live feel of a band that has toured relentlessly (as No. 2 have). ""What, then, is the negative?"" you ask. Simply put, No. 2 lack adventurousness. Gust knows the formula and he'll be damned if he's going to mess with it. This results in plenty of head-bobbers, with the band opening (as Heatmiser often did) with poppy licks and then moving on through that good old rock-song structure. The lyrics are equally inoffensive. ""I don't mind a little confusion/ I don't mind, throw it all away,"" Gust sings in the opener, ""A Little Confusion"". He's pretty much cool with whatever-- a mentality he duly passes on to the listener. Not that What Does Good Luck Bring? is devoid of any variation. The pop factor is still evident in many spots, from the handclaps in ""More, More"" to the cowbell in ""Good Intentions"". ""8:45 a.m."", meanwhile, offers up a downright countrified beat. And there are several slow, wistful moments, such as the atmospheric folk-pop of ""Stranger's March""-- which recalls Smith's DreamWorks output-- and the closing title track, which pairs Gust with another former Heatmiser bandmate, Sam Coomes of Quasi. In the end, though, a little something is missing. Maybe it's that Gust has ridden the same horse one too many times. Maybe he's just lost a half-step. Whatever the reason, one can't help but listen to What Does Good Luck Bring? and to Smith's last album, 2000's Figure 8, and wish that maybe, somehow, these two would team up again to spark their creative fires.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5813-what-does-good-luck-bring/,In Music We Trust,2002.0,"No. 2 - What Does Good Luck Bring?

Pop/R&B has been a genre that's been done and redone multiple times before, but No. 2's latest album 'What Does Good Luck Bring?' stands out from the rest. This album is a great mixture of pop and R&B, with relatable lyrics and catchy melodies that will sit with you long after you've finished listening to it.

First things first: the band. No. 2 is a relatively new band in the music scene, but certainly not one that should be overlooked. Made up of a group of talented individuals, No.2 gained popularity through their collaborations with other artists and their performances in small clubs and bars. They finally got their big break when they were signed by a major record label, and they have certainly made the most of it with their latest album.

The album 'What Does Good Luck Bring?' is one that was created with thoughtful attention to detail. It's clear that the band put a lot of love and care into this album, as every track brings something unique to the table. The album leads off with the sultry and soulful ""All I Need is You,"" which sets the tone for the rest of the album. From there, we're taken on a rollercoaster journey of love, self-discovery, and hope.

Personally, I really enjoyed the track ""Better Days."" The upbeat melody perfectly complements the positive message of embracing a new day, even if everything seems to be going wrong. The vocals in this track are particularly impressive, and you can't help but feel motivated as you listen to it.

Another track that really stood out to me was ""Hollywood Nights,"" a song about the disillusionment that comes with chasing dreams of fame and fortune. In a world full of influencers and social media hype, this track is a refreshingly honest reminder that not everything is as glamorous as it seems.

Overall, 'What Does Good Luck Bring?' deserves a solid 7 out of 10 rating. It's not a perfect album, but it's definitely one that will resonate with listeners. No. 2 has done an excellent job of infusing modern R&B elements into their pop sound, and the lyrics are both relatable and thought-provoking. I highly recommend giving this album a listen, and I can't wait to see what No. 2 has in store for us in the future.","1.

Owls,Two,Rock,7.3,March 25 2014,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"There's little chance that listeners unfamilar with Tim Kinsella's work would refer to the angular, incomprehensible melodies of Owls’ self-titled 2001 LP as “pop”, and it’s even less likely that his lyrics, which are cryptic, piecemeal, and pointed as a ransom note, would strike them as “emo”.  Owls is Kinsella’s most accessible project, though, and it’s proven massively influential for countless self-identifying emo groups. Regardless, the funny thing about Two, the project's first release in nearly 13 years, is that as much as it appeases those who would call it “highly anticipated”, it might actually appeal more to newcomers. Two does sound like a natural progression for the project—“Four Works of Art…” is almost raga-like in its call-and-response drone, not too dissimilar from Owls' opener “What Whorse You Wrote Id On”—but this is not a case of Owls picking up where they left off. Tim Kinsella actually hits notes (even the high ones) and, yes, the unwieldy song titles of Owls have been ditched as well. Mike Kinsella’s drumming is intuitive and fluid rather than fractured, which allows bassist Sam Zurick to actually groove rather than forcing himself within the gnarled arpeggios of guitarist Victor Villareal. A colleague mentioned Real Estate upon hearing “Ancient Stars Seed…”, and there are parts of Two that qualify as “indie rock”—the amiable amble of “The Lion…”, “I’m Surprised…” righting itself into a genuine chorus. Whereas Owls required the kind of sweep-picking mastery outlined in Guitar World columns, a beginner could play some of these songs on guitar. Unlike Owls—or almost anything that Tim Kinsella has been involved with—Two doesn’t need a preemptive warning about its “challenging” nature, which might disappoint diehards who relish the challenge. Two lacks the explosive, uncanny chemistry of Owls—nothing matches the unbridled exuberance of “Everyone Is My Friend”, the fragile beauty of “Anyone Can Have A Good Time”, the frisky rhythmic interplay of “I Want the Quiet Moments of a Party Girl”, and there's not a lyric that hits as squarely as “It’s not impossible to think of you thinking of me.” Two sounds comparatively normalized, both due to Owls’ own aesthetic softening and the dozens of bands who have co-opted this sound wholesale. It doesn't clearly demonstrate why people follow Kinsella’s every whim, or why he spent nearly two decades being despised. Ultimately, Two is a showcase for Kinsella as a frontman rather than a bandleader. He’s always been a tough sell, even from the days of the relatively revered-by-consensus Cap’n Jazz, but if you tried to engage with Joan of Arc album titles like In Rape Fantasy and Terror Sex We Trust (let alone the contents therein) and immediately determined, “Yeah, this isn’t for me,” no one would blame you. But in the past few years, he’s found rejuvenation in old age similar to Mark Kozelek: simultaneously emboldened and embittered by a life in music and a resultant, unflappable fanbase, they’ve pretty much stopped caring about public perception, which has resulted in some of their most honest and direct music. Two is filled with dozens of obtuse word jumbles that only make sense to Tim Kinsella and others that only make sense if you live in Chicago, but there's also very private thoughts that cloak their own profundity. Two can variously scan as a sly critique of internet culture, or aging within the indie rock community, or just aging in general as an artist of limited earning potential. On “Why Oh Why…”, Kinsella casually doles a withering dismissal of thinkpiece culture: “It’s cute how you assume your experience of the world is the world.” But as a cult artist, he understands the appeal of that cloistered mindset: “Haven’t you ever been new somewhere?/ Haven’t you been envious of membership’s endlessness?” Two practically demands listening along with the lyrics sheet; this is high-concept, cerebral stuff that's difficult to wrench any kind of visceral thrill from. Opener “Four Works of Art…” is an ingeniously crafted song both musically and lyrically, but it lays out “A way of understanding this historical period” by letting you consider the commonalities between a car filled with trash, Christopher Kubasik, David Petraeus, and a CCR tape—and yet it all rattles around your head in a way that’s more unsettling than the prodding done by Owls’ progeny. Even though Owls serve as a touchstone in 2014, there's still little that quite sounds like Two.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19135-owls-two/,Polyvinyl,2014.0,"If you're looking for an album that will tug at your heartstrings while keeping your head banging, Owls' ""Two"" is it. This band is one of those hidden gems that most people haven't heard of, but once you discover them, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them.

Owls is a band with a bit of a complicated back story. It was started by Mike Kinsella, who is also the drummer of the band American Football. At the height of American Football's success, Mike's brother died, and the band went on hiatus. In order to cope with his grief, Mike started writing songs under the name Owls. The band eventually turned into a full-on project, with Victor Villarreal joining on guitar.

""Two"" is Owls' second album after a long hiatus. To be honest, I was a bit hesitant to listen to it. I didn't know if they would be able to top their first album, which was already near perfect. However, they managed to create an album that is even better than the first one.

The album is an expertly crafted blend of rock music with some unexpected twists that keep you on your toes. The lyrics are heart-wrenching, dealing with themes of loss, grief, and the struggle to move on. But at the same time, the music is upbeat and has an undeniable energy that will leave you feeling like you can take on the world.

One standout track is ""I'm Surprised…"", which starts off slow and contemplative before building to an explosive chorus. It's a song that manages to be both melancholic and uplifting at the same time. Another standout track is ""Ancient Stars Seed…"" which starts off with a spoken word intro before bursting into an infectious guitar riff.

Overall, ""Two"" is an album that I would highly recommend to anyone who loves rock music. Owls is a band that knows how to write catchy songs that will get stuck in your head for days. While the band's history may be complicated, their music is anything but. In fact, the raw emotion and passion that went into creating this album is what makes it stand apart from others in the genre.

The Prima Donnas,"Drugs, Sex and Discotheques",Electronic,7.7,December 4 2001,Matt LeMay,Contributor,"There are some who seem to believe that all good music must be born of suffering; that in order to turn out an album of any merit whatsoever, an artist must be either twitchy, crazy, lonely, dejected, or just plain fucking miserable. These are the same people who'll quickly dismiss anything that isn't ""serious"" as being ""childish,"" ""amateurish,"" or simply ""stupid."" It pretty much goes without saying that these people should be dragged from the corners in which they brood and brutally bludgeoned with tire irons. Granted, this is a rather extreme, not to mention labor-intensive, method of sorting out a few self-serious pricks. No, on second thought, I propose something new and different-- something to show all the quasi-intellectual gloom junkies out there that music can be really fun without being stupid or political or relevant. I propose that our sad little friends are dragged from the corners in which they brood, brutally bludgeoned with tire irons, and then given a copy of the now-defunct Prima Donnas' Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques. The Prima Donnas, a convivial half-parody of a keyboard-driven new wave ensemble, fronted by Otto Matik (who also records under the similarly ludicrous pseudoname Gene Defcon), are certainly not out to choke you with intellectualism; the fourteen tracks on Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques are all about cheesy fun. But the three gentlemen in the band manage to make so many brilliant nods to the sleaziest, cheesiest elements of new wave that the album functions wonderfully both as a piece of catchy retro fetishism and as a hilarious exaggeration of an already-hilarious era. There's a painstakingly elaborate story behind the Prima Donnas-- one that I won't bother getting into, but which involves English orphanages, Texan blues singers, and plenty of drug-induced comas. But the most immediately fripping facet of the Prima Donnas isn't their humor; it's their music. The first three tracks on here are energetic, mildly abrasive romps through the world of retro, synth-driven rock, with lead singer Otto's unique, nasal vocals cutting right through fuzzy keyboards. With ""Headfull of Pills,"" the band truly hits their stride, turning out one of the single most memorable songs I've heard all year. With slinky synths, an almost intolerably great melody, and strikingly funny lyrics, the song manages to be every bit as good as any song to come out of the era the Prima Donnas are sending up. Elsewhere on the album, things get a bit sketchy, as the band seems to get too wrapped up in their gimmick to concentrate on making focused music. ""F.U.K.,"" one of many songs on Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques to play up the fact that the Prima Donnas are ""British,"" borders on obnoxious. But entertaining moments like the softly spoken vocal interlude on ""Lavender Shakedown"" manage to bring up an album that might otherwise suffer from getting too wrapped up in its own concept. While some songwriting lapses prevent Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques from ever achieving actual greatness as an album, the consistent level of energy, humor, and fun (not to mention the inclusion of a single flat-out amazing song), makes this album immensely enjoyable. This album succeeds because, like the music it references, it embraces its gimmick with self-aware ridiculousness.

Hot Hot Heat,Hot Hot Heat,"Electronic,Rock",5.1,July 7 2016,Zoe Camp,Contributor,"After 17 years, five albums, numerous line up changes, Hot Hot Heat are calling it quits with their final, self-titled LP–not that they expect you to care. The Canadian group are totally fine with their spiral into obscurity, because they’ve have nothing left to say, judging from frontman and principal songwriter Steve Bays’ comments to the press in the wake of the split. “I really have no idea what it means to put out a record out in 2016,” he admitted to The Independent, surprised that anyone even bothers about Hot Hot Heat anymore, or cares about their dissolution: “It feels like we’re getting a warm reception so far, and not any kind of… ‘What are you doing here?’” Bays’ statement is ostensibly intended as a humble shout-out to the diehards, and yet the self-deprecating jokes belie gravely low expectations and a dearth of self-confidence. It’s not the best look for a triumphant farewell address, but considering the purgatory faced by Hot Hot Heat’s former peers and touring partners, can you blame him? (Anyone heard from Louis XIV? She Wants Revenge? The Bravery?) Still, the quartet have reason be proud, or at least not so damn hard on themselves. While the bulk of their contemporaries have more or less fallen into a temporal tar pit in recent years, Hot Hot Heat started this decade out strong with 2010’s Ryan Dahle-produced, forward-thinking Future Breeds, a decidedly safe–but nonetheless enjoyable–update to the off-kilter, post-punk-y pop showcased on 2002’s Make Up the Breakdown, the group’s strongest album. As expected for a career-concluding LP, Hot Hot Heat does away with this progressive approach: instead, they’ve offered up a thirty-minute, ten-track retrospective that reflects on the past decade-and-a-half with playful fondness–and beneath the cheery surface, tangible fatigue. Bays framed the band’s self-titled LP as a return to Hot HotHeat’s punkish early period, shortly before the runaway success of Make Up the Breakdown garnered the group international attention. At that time, Hot Hot Heat recalled a more unwieldy XTC, and between Bays’ energetic barks and squeals and since-departed guitarist Dante Decaro’s proficiency in choppy punk riffs, “Bandages’” short reign on the rock charts offered a refreshing dose of goofy new-wave à la Devo. Sadly, despite his claims of the contrary, this familiar old spark rarely ignites Hot Hot Heat, musically nor lyrically. Bays’ usual tics–the high-pitched yelps, the glam posturing–have all but faded away, leaving us with Julian Casablancas’ long-lost Canadian cousin, all sneered soh-ries and throated mumbles on “Modern Mind.” Similarly, guitarist Luke Paquin sounds like he's spending a lot of time with the last two Strokes LPs, swiping swatches of Albert Hammond Jr.’s Thin Lizzy-meets-Daft Punk palette for “Magnitude,” “Mayor of the City”, and “Sad Sad Situation.” (I’m not sure what’s more unsettling: the incessant déja vu, or Hot Hot Heat’s uncanny ability to make those albums sound good.) Hot Hot Heat’s curtain call isn’t all recycling–accordingly for its position in the band’s discography, the record entails a litany of wistful reflections. “It could’ve been you/It should’ve been you,” Bays laments on the chorus to the opening track, a hand-wringing portrait dedicated to a childhood friend who never rose to his glorious potential (arguably, a narrative one could extend to the band itself); on “Pull Levers,” he repeatedly reminds the audience that it's “too little, too late.” Regardless of the group’s intention, these contrite undertones are easily the album’s most compelling trait, and its best songs tackle that ambivalence head on: the nocturnal samba “Alaskan Midnight Sun,” a nod to the band’s early flirtations with world music, as well as the aptly-titled closing shuffle “The Memory’s Here.” It makes for an oddly bittersweet closing note: Rarely does a band bid you farewell and admit it overstayed its welcome in the same breath.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22027-hot-hot-heat/,Culvert Music,2016.0,"Hot Hot Heat - Hot Hot Heat: A Mediocre Offering from a Once-Promising Band 

When it comes to indie rock, Hot Hot Heat is a name that's difficult to ignore. With a sound that blends elements of electronic and rock music, the group quickly gained popularity in the early 2000s. Unfortunately, their self-titled album released in 2016 showed that their best days may be behind them.

The album feels like a haphazard collection of songs that were thrown together without much thought. There's no real sense of cohesion, and each track sounds like it could belong on a completely different album. This is particularly disappointing given the band's history of creating albums that flow seamlessly from beginning to end.

It's clear that the band's sound has evolved over the years, but the evolution feels disjointed rather than intentional. There are elements of their signature sound, such as the energetic beats and catchy hooks, but they've been watered down and lack the intensity and charisma that made their earlier work so compelling.

That's not to say that the album is without its bright spots. ""Kid Who Stays in the Picture"" has a strong chorus and upbeat tempo that will get even the most die-hard cynics tapping their toes. ""Magnitude"" feels like a nod to the band's earlier, more punk-influenced sound, and ""Comeback of the Century"" has a memorable, sing-along chorus that will undoubtedly translate well to a live show.

However, as a whole, the album just doesn't live up to the expectations set by Hot Hot Heat's previous work. It's hard to shake the feeling that the band is just going through the motions, trying to recapture the magic of their early days without bringing anything fresh or new to the table.

As someone who loved the band's earlier albums, it's disappointing to see them release an album that's so mediocre. There are moments of brilliance, but they're overshadowed by the lackluster tracks that make up the bulk of the album.

Ween,quebec,"Experimental,Rock",7.7,August 13 2003,Eric Carr,Contributor,"""'...So I kinda mope around all day, dropping hints, thinking everybody forgot my birthday, then just when I get home to tell everyone to go fuck themselves-- ""Surprise!"" And wouldn't you know, my mom has gone and arranged a surprise party. It's as lame as it's ever been on any other sitcom, but at least there's cake. Mom hands me a plate and says, 'Dig in, tubby.' So I get a piece of cake, take a bite, and all I can taste is the white-hot sting of metal piercing the roof of my mouth, and the metallic (like pennies, actually) taste of my own blood. I start screaming, spitting blood everywhere in giant, viscous globs, shouting, 'Why the hell are there razor blades in my birthday cake?' which pretty much sounds like 'blurbblurbblurbcake!' And my mom just says, 'Now you've gotten blood all over your birthday cake,' takes off her mask, and it's Dean and Gene Ween. I feel like I'm on Candid Camera; boy, am I ever embarrassed.' That's what I have so far."" ""Are you actually going to open a review like that? That's revolting! And boring! It doesn't even make any sense."" ""Neither does Ween. It's about Ween; besides, quebec is a boring album-- 'Guess what! It's Ween! We're insane for the entire first half! Surprised? No?' The biggest surprise is that halfway through, they turn into a poor man's Floyd. Whee. Plus, they once said that one of their fantasies as a band was to spray their audience down with diarrhea while playing 'Poop Ship Destroyer.' That's just as revolting."" ""Whatever, you're alienating your audience. No one wants to read about you gushing blood, or any of this nonsense. They want to read about Ween's new album."" ""C'mon, half the people who really like Ween live in psycho wards; I just gave them all a helpful suggestion."" ""You need to smoke this right now."" [Excerpted from ""quebec: Journey to the center of Ween""] Methcathinone (""Speed"" derivative, in common parlance): Total inability to relax or concentrate for any length of time. ""It's Gonna Be a Long Night"" takes on elevated significance; listened compulsively on repeat for fifty-one hours (1,080 repetitions). Throbbing rockabilly-by-way-of-cheese-metal riffs carried over from Moistboyz side project opened the album almost as well as the fondly remembered ""You Fucked Up"" opened GodWeenSatan. Made me want to set my room on fire; instead I repainted it twice, both times blue, as Gene sang directly to me, ""Don't call your mother/ Don't call a priest/ Don't call the doctor/ Call the police/ You bring the razor blade/ I'll bring the speed/ It's gonna be a long night."" Other songs not listened to. Oxycontin (Painkiller): ""Zoloft"" is nice. Sat motionless three inches above the couch, vaguely nauseated, while ""Zoloft""'s loopy, wavy percussion, harp-like flutterings, and lounge keyboards kept me floating sedately. Almost laughed when Dean sang about sucking down Zoloft, but then didn't feel like it. Almost thought it sounded forced, like a gratuitous inclusion for people who expected another quirky track like ""The HIV Song"", but then didn't feel like it. Total tropical hammock-style, piÃ±a colada relaxation. The weird pixie voices in the background almost scared me, but then I didn't feel like it. Nitrous Oxide (N2O): Mixed effect. The total randomness of the album's first half-- from metal-blade racket, to classic rock nostalgia, to full-on whacked-out Ween-ness-- is all hilariously near-perfect Ween. Even the name makes me giggle. Ween. Heh. The Vaudevillian theatrics of ""Hey There Fancypants"" made me wet myself with laughter, but it stopped there. Even on nitrous, the tired, prog-influenced back end of quebec isn't very funny. Cannibis (Marijuana): I totally get it. It all makes sense now, man... On ""Captain"", they're not just, like, ripping off Floyd's massive orchestral swells and psychedelic haze; they're channeling it, you know? Ween, like, goofs on that wacky shit like the creepy vibes of ""Happy Colored Marbles"", but they left their hearts back in the 60s; the overblown classic rock sweep is the true Ween. The apocalyptic build of ""If You Could Save Yourself (You'd Save Us All)"" is vintage, Ziggy-caliber Bowie, ""The Argus"", and it's still, like... but the most boring track of all, ""Alcan Road"", in which there's nothing but hollowed-out, windy drone for, like, ever is cool, on pot. Even the indecipherable, thrashing noise at the tempestuous center of ""So Many People in My Neighborhood"" is brilliant as a break from the way serious psychedelic guitar washes, sitars, and underwater vocals of tracks like the aptly named ""Tried and True"". It's a total bummer, too, 'cause when I'm sober I like ""crazy Ween"" a whole lot more than ""sincere-ish Ween,"" and there's a whole lot more of the latter on this album. I'm gonna need more pot. Diacetylmorphine (Heroin): No effect. Passed out; threw up in my own mouth. [Excerpted from my soon-to-be-published biography, Nancy Reagan: Wolf in a Sheep's Hairdo] And lo! she approached the podium, and thus spake to the doe-eyed graduating class of Winnemack University, 1982: ""Graduating class of 1982, hear me! Just say 'No' to drugs! I never took drugs, and I'm First Lady of the most powerful nation in the world! I had sex with the President! The hippies lost! No one listens to that freaky, burnout ""progressive rock"" anymore! Really, no one even cares about Pink Floyd or Jethro Tull!"" She didn't talk about the graduation, or the future, or anything; most heard her message, but some did not. Were Gene and Dean Ween in the audience that day? Did they even go to college? I don't know, but I do know this: By the time they finally burned through whatever stash they had and got around to making quebec, they learned a few lessons, and did some growing up along the way. They can still sell crazy with the best of 'em, and they do, for a while; when they calm down a little, though, suddenly lines like, ""I'm makin' time/ Breakin' ground/ Greyhound Bus to chocolate town,"" are still good for a chuckle, but there's a disturbingly genuine honesty underlying it all, and the beautiful echoes of the cascading solo to conclude ""I Don't Want It"" will kill any hint of cynicism in even the blackest heart. But back to Nancy... [Excerpted from the review most people probably wished I had written] I don't think anyone who already has some notion of wanting quebec could possibly be disappointed-- it's the genre-defying psych of The Mollusk and the incongruous irreverence of 12 Golden Country Greats, and some of the madness that is GodWeenSatan, and it's a lot better than the go-nowhere White Pepper, but nothing I say makes any difference. It's Ween. Their fans adore them, and the rest of you don't care.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8605-quebec/,Sanctuary,2003.0,"If you're a music lover in search of something truly original, then look no further than the experimental rock band Ween and their 2003 album ""Quebec."" With a rating of 7.7 out of 10, this album is a true testament to the band's unique sound.

Ween has been around since the mid-1980s, with a sound that cannot be easily defined. Dean Ween (Mickey Melchiondo) and Gene Ween (Aaron Freeman) are the driving force behind the band, with a musical style that ranges from rock to experimental and everything in between. But it's their willingness to take risks and push the boundaries of what's expected in music that sets them apart.

""Quebec"" was released in 2003, after the band had left their longtime record label Elektra Records. The album was originally intended to be a double album but was later condensed into a single disc. Despite the challenges, the album shines, displaying the band's growth and maturity while still maintaining their unique voice.

The album opens with the track ""It's Gonna Be A Long Night,"" an upbeat rock tune with a groovy drum beat and catchy guitar riffs. It's the perfect opener, setting the tone for the entire album. However, it's the moments of experimentalism that really make ""Quebec"" stand out. ""Hey There Fancypants"" is a prime example, with its melodic piano and accordion combining to create a quirky, off-beat sound.

The album's centerpiece and arguably its strongest track, ""Transdermal Celebration,"" is a slow-burning rocker that builds to a frenzied crescendo. It's hard not to get lost in the catchy chorus and infectious guitar riff, making this song an instant classic.

Personally, ""Chocolate Town"" is my favorite track. Its gentle piano melody and haunting vocals transport me to a sweeter and simpler world. It's a great song to unwind to or for when you just need a break, allowing yourself to melt into this elegant score.

All in all, ""Quebec"" is a great addition to Ween's discography, showcasing the band's ability to create something truly original and fresh. Whether you're a die-hard Ween fan or just looking to expand your musical horizons, ""Quebec"" is a must-listen.","1.

Various Artists,Riddimentary: Diplo Selects Greensleeves,,7.5,February 11 2011,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"About four years ago, the Jamaican label Greensleeves released a double-disc greatest-hits set called From Dubplate to Download: The Best of Greensleeves Records. The label's been releasing music for decades now, and listening to the set felt like taking a crash course in 30 years of Jamaican anthems, from the the Wailing Souls' slow, organic roots music to the fired-up high-BPM digital dancehall of recent years. And as compulsively listenable as From Dubplate to Download was, there was enough variety in that long arc that the stuff at the end really didn't belong to the same genre as the stuff at the beginning. When you look back at Greensleeves' catalog, you're looking at a truly varied landscape. As a DJ, Diplo's greatest asset has always been his versatility, his willingness to pull from any and all possible sources in order to keep a party moving. Never Scared, the landmark 2003 mix from Diplo and Low Budget's Hollertronix project, introduced many of us to Diplo's flailing style by finding room for the Bangles and Baltimore club and the Clash and random-ass Southern rap micro-hits; it felt like they were chewing up the whole of popular music and puking it back out in danceable form. In recent years, that DJ style has hardened into something of a shtick as lesser DJs have taken it and run. But Diplo, at his best, still has a rare sense of rule-blurring vision; he managed, for instance, to get an entire festival crowd dumbing out to Ace of Base's ""All That She Wants"" during Major Lazer's set at last year's Pitchfork Music Festival. The whole Major Lazer project is a testament to how much Diplo and partner Switch love Jamaican music in all its stylistic variety, so you'd think that, given Greensleeves' massive back catalog to play with, Diplo would take the opportunity to just go nuts. Not the case. Riddimentary: Diplo Selects Greensleeves, his DJ mix of music from the label's past, turns out to be a love letter to a very specific period in the genre's evolution: The early-80s moment when deep one-drop roots reggae was just starting to transform into dancehall. It was a time when all these older stars started to integrate digital drum-triggers and echoey synthesizer lines into their tracks, and when the Barrington Levy/Yellowman style of nonsensical stutter-scatting was blowing up. Riddimentary isn't a wide-ranging dance party; it's a mix that maintains a single mood and a single tempo throughout. You could dance to it, if you wanted, but you could also wash dishes or read a book or drive down a highway in the middle of the night. In focusing on this one instant in the label's history, Diplo shows a sharp understanding of the genre. There's only one track that appears on both the Greensleeves greatest-hits record and Riddimentary: ""Telephone Love"", a 1988 crossover hit from Londoner J.C. Lodge, by far the most modern-sounding track on Diplo's mix. Riddimentary does have a few big, immortal anthems-- Gregory Isaacs' ""Night Nurse"", for instance-- but it's just as likely to chase the genre down the bizarre rabbit holes it was digging at the time. So we get some dubby, digitized instrumental experiments from lifers like Joe Gibbs and Prince Far I. We also get a few tracks very specific to their moment, like ""Police in Helicopter"", John Holt's threat to burn down sugarcane fields if police keep cracking down on marijuana farmers, or ""Eventide Fire a Disaster"", Barrington Levy and General Echo's mournful elegy about a 1980 blaze in a Kingston old folks' home. Riddimentary isn't a defining work of genre exhumation or anything; if you love reggae, you might have a decent chunk of this mix in your iTunes, and the more obscure material probably won't change your life. But it does work as a warm, sustained mood-piece and a serious demonstration that Diplo knows what he's talking about when it comes to this reggae thing. If you happened to hear it in the background, very little about the mix would signal that Diplo was the guy behind it; he barely even digs into his endless supply of airhorn effects and DJ drops. He just plays the background and lets the music do the talking. In this case, that's exactly what he needed to do.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15086-riddimentary-diplo-selects-greensleeves/,VP,2011.0,"Are you a fan of dancehall music and looking for a fresh and exciting collection to add to your playlist? Look no further than the ""Riddimentary: Diplo Selects Greensleeves"" album by Various Artists. This album is a testament to Diplo's impeccable taste in music, as he curates some of the most iconic and timeless tracks in this genre. With a rating of 7.5 out of 10, this album is sure to please any fan of classic and contemporary dancehall music.

Let's start with a little bit of history. Greensleeves Records has been a juggernaut in the reggae and dancehall music scene since the 1970s. Established by Chris Sedgwick and Chris Cracknell and ultimately acquired by VP Records, Greensleeves has become synonymous with the genre. The label has launched the careers of some of the greatest artists in reggae history, including Barrington Levy, Eek-a-Mouse, and Gregory Isaacs. It's no surprise, then, that Diplo chose to work with Greensleeves on this project.

The story behind the creation of the ""Riddimentary"" album is equally fascinating. Diplo, himself a producer and DJ, is known for his eclectic taste in music. He has worked with a variety of artists in different genres, from M.I.A. to Justin Bieber. With this album, he wanted to pay homage to the music that influenced his own work. He selected tracks from the vast Greensleeves catalog and added his own touches to create a collection that feels both fresh and familiar.

Now, onto the music itself. One of the things that sets the ""Riddimentary"" album apart is the sheer quality of the tracks. From the infectious groove of Tenor Saw's ""Ring the Alarm"" to the smooth vocals of Sanchez on ""Loneliness,"" each song on this album is a classic in its own right. It's clear that Diplo approached this project with a great deal of reverence for the artists and the music they created.

One of the standout tracks is ""Bam Bam"" by Sister Nancy, which has been sampled in numerous songs over the years. Diplo's version of the song adds a modern twist to the classic, with updated production and some additional instrumentation. It's a perfect example of how Diplo was able to put his own stamp on these classic tracks without sacrificing the integrity of the original music.

As someone who loves dancehall music, I was thrilled to discover this album. The songs are expertly curated, and the production is top-notch. I appreciate the way that Diplo was able to modernize these classic tracks without losing their authenticity. The album is a great representation of the genre as a whole, and it's a must-listen for any dancehall fan.","Step 1: Review A uses more complex sentences and contains more specific details and background information about the genre of music and the label Greensleeves.

Doves,The Last Broadcast,Rock,8.0,June 6 2002,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"So I'm playing with my new office chair right now. The floor of my apartment is wood-finished and extremely warped, so there are all kinds of little bumps and valleys to roll over. Combine that with the fact that all the ball bearings and wheels are brand new and heavily viscous and I could amuse myself doing this for quite a while. I guess it's the simple things that give you pleasure after a long day at work, juggling projects and trying to get out of there at five. My job is pretty hectic and I usually come home all wound up, so it's good to have these little diversions to help myself. Tonight the stress has me feeling particularly goofy. Normally I wouldn't think of Manchester's Doves as an appropriate soundtrack for this kind of mood, but that's largely because until very recently I was only familiar with their first album, 2000's dark, murky Lost Souls. On that record, the band showed their facility with dark, claustrophobic textures and muted melodic statements, only occasionally indulging their impressive pop sense. And while their latest offering, The Last Broadcast, could hardly be called a wholesale revamping of their sound, it concentrates mostly on elements that the trio kept very subdued on their debut. For one thing, while Lost Souls was certainly nothing to sniff at, the band sounds infinitely more comfortable and confident here, placing more faith in their writing and relying less on production to put forth their ideas. The record still abounds with thoughtful audio details, mind you-- but here they're almost always employed in the service of melody. Even the exceptions to that rule-- the short instrumental tracks like ""Intro"" and ""Where We're Calling From""-- build tension while moving toward the catharsis of the next fully-fleshed song. ""Where We're Calling From"" is a dense wall of swirling guitars and keyboards, growing ever thicker until finally evaporating, leaving the initial strums of ""N.Y."" in its place. ""N.Y."" is exultant in its first verse, all crashing guitars and soaring vocals. The instrumental midsection is one the band's finest moments, cut through with an unobtrusive string section and some surprisingly dynamic interplay. ""Let's go while we can/ Put your finger on the map/ Who cares where it lands,"" sings Jez Williams as the song gathers steam behind him. It's one of several tracks that makes The Last Broadcast a brighter, and in some ways more accessible, album than its predecessor. Elsewhere, the band lay down a ream of excellent songs beginning with ""Words,"" a steadily chugging confection of astral guitar, vocal harmonies and glockenspiel that does a remarkable job of boring a limited melody straight into your memory. It's followed by the loping, seven-minute ""There Goes the Fear,"" which is a strong candidate for one of the band's best songs yet, its bounce befitting the subdued melody and diving, almost country-ish slide guitar that swoops in the background. Doves have always been a band who could come out swinging with a powerful pop song when they wanted to, and this just proves that they should do it more often. A few songs naturally point back to the band's original direction, such as the haunting, noir ""Friday's Dust,"" with its crystalline strings (arranged by Sean O'Hagan and Marcus Holdaway) and strange production. Devoid of percussion, the song floats along almost like something Talk Talk might have produced in their later years, replete with ghostly clarinets and odd smatterings of brass. Of course, ""Pounding"" bounces right back with a... well, pounding rhythm and a sterling melody, as well as some spirited rhythm guitar. The boys get downright proggy on the intro to ""The Sulphur Man,"" with sweeping strings deceptively setting the stage for what turns out to be a relatively modest song, albeit one cut through with all sorts of inventive little flourishes, like the strings that rise in the verses, threatening to overtake the vocals before abruptly backing down and retreating to the background, only to attempt another coup a few seconds later. It's those details that make a good song great, and that's what makes The Last Broadcast an easy record to come back to-- chances are you missed an awful lot the first few times you listened. ""Caught by the River"" closes things on a high note, riding out on a sturdy acoustic guitar frame adorned by the band's usual sonic fireworks and pushed forward by some very economical drumming. To the listener's benefit, the electric guitar parts aren't so economical, and the band masterfully layers soaring leads, ultimately ending on a glowing bed of reverb and clean guitar. It's a fittingly dramatic end to an album that's full of drama, without the tiresome excess-- a healthy balance if you ask me. Watch your toes while I chair-speed back to the stereo to give it another spin.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2430-the-last-broadcast/,Capitol,2002.0,"Welcome to the journey of Doves' 'The Last Broadcast' album. For the uninitiated, Doves are an English rock band, hailing from Cheshire, consisting of twin brothers Jez and Andy Williams, and Jimi Goodwin, on vocals, bass, and guitar. They have produced great music over the years, but, 'The Last Broadcast' comes out as their magnum opus. 

As artists, Doves have never been easy to pin down. Their sound is at once anthemic and introspective, mixing rock, Brit-pop, shoegaze, and post-punk influences into a style that is entirely their own. The album is the follow-up to their critically acclaimed debut album, 'Lost Souls,' and it does not disappoint. 

The creation story behind this masterpiece is as interesting as the album itself. The band members, in their search for a proper studio after they had outgrown Manchester's Revolution Studios, stumbled upon abandoned warehouses in the backstreets of Stockport. In these empty industrial spaces, sonics echoing with the ghosts of the North West punk scene, Doves found their new home. This atmosphere permeates the making of the album, adding a certain grittiness and rawness to its sound. 

'The Last Broadcast' hits hard right from the start, opening with the electrifying title track. The song's heavy bass groove lays the groundwork for Jimi Goodwin's soaring, emotive falsetto. 'Words' starts off with catchy beats and intertwining guitar licks, eventually building into a driving, riff-heavy chorus. The standout track, 'Caught By The River,' starts off simply enough, with gentle acoustic guitar and soft, sighing vocals. It's a song about memories of simpler times, and it's pure poetry. The song gradually builds in tension and energy, exploding into a chorus of crashing cymbals and soaring harmonies. 

In between the high-intensity numbers, the album's pace slows down with songs like 'Friday's Dust' and 'Satellites,' adding a certain delicateness to the overall listening experience. 'M62 Song,' a haunting, atmospheric instrumental piece, is particularly evocative, capturing the feeling of driving through Northern England on a desolate night. 

Overall, this album is a revelation in a time where many music albums have lost their charm. It's beautifully written, exquisitely crafted, and emotionally complex. It's an album that can be enjoyed while driving, chilling, or even working out. For me, it's a go-to album for days when the world feels a little too much. It's hard to pick a favourite track as each song stands out in its own way, but 'There Goes The Fear' and 'Pounding' never fail to elicit strong emotions. 

In conclusion, Doves' 'The Last Broadcast' stands tall as one of the most remarkable rock albums of the early 2000s. Its unique sound, thoughtful lyrics, and impeccable songwriting will always make it a standout amongst music lovers. If you have not listened to it yet, you really are missing out!","1.

Wolf People,Tidings,Rock,6.4,February 22 2010,Zach Kelly,Contributor,"London's Wolf People come from a long line of British blues-rock. Though certainly drawing from the roots music of the Southern U.S., they are equally entrenched in mead-soaked English folk, classic rock, and psychedelia. For each woolly bit of boogie, there's a supporting cast of trippy flute accents, backwards guitars, and ramshackle nods to mod rock and paisley-patterned freakouts. All of which work together to produce a number of catchy stompers on the band's first full length, Tidings. But as much as Tidings rides high on it's own brand of sweaty juke-joint appeal, its finest moments are a grab bag of genre detours. ""Black Water"", a crunchy slab of drug-rock steeped in mystic imagery (it sounds only a little bit like a Spinal Tap song), works more like a Renaissance Faire theme than a muscular blues number. ""Cotton Strands"" is a Love-styled bloomer bursting with sitars and flutes, yet it still manages to retain the feeling of a creepy backwoods sÃ©ance. ""Untitled"" acts like the perfect introduction to both Nuggets and LSD, and late album cut ""Empty Heart"" boasts a strut that has T. Rex stank all over it. And there's plenty of brawniness to go around, too, like the single ""October Fires"", which is a wild, noodly groover, detailing some sort of sacrifice ritual over a sweaty honky-tonk rhythm, harmonica, and punchy guitar details. Thing is, Tidings isn't the tight rock record it appears to be. Almost half of the songs are tagged as interludes, most of which are field recordings or outtakes of aimless strumming, strange whirrings, and drunken ramblings. Frontman Jack Sharp made these recordings between 2005 and 2007 in Bedford, England, before the current iteration of Wolf People. So in a sense Tidings serves as more of an odds-and-ends collection than an album proper. Though occasionally a particularly strange piece of noise or a tasty riff will manage to prick up your ears during these sections, they seriously hamper the movement of the record. While the patchwork construction does unintentionally remind you of a live set (one that's obviously just lousy with tech problems), skipping through the dodgy one-offs and tepid noise detours will leave you with only a handful of tracks worth holding on to. Most of the proper tunes succeed because they roll along so eagerly, so it's hard to imagine why Wolf People would sap the album of all its momentum with these little speed bumps. If these experiments weren't so dull and scatterbrained, they'd at least serve as a sort of counterweight to the rockers, making the good stuff really pop. But the full-band cuts don't need a push. Ditch the interludes and you have yourself a hot, swampy EP full of terrific little boogie-minded gems.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13921-tidings/,Jagjaguwar,2010.0,"If you're a fan of rock music and you're looking for something a bit different, then Wolf People's 'Tidings' might just be the album you've been waiting for. This band has been around for a while now, and their experience definitely shows in their music. With a sound that combines traditional rock with a little bit of folk and psychedelic elements, there's just something special about what they're doing.

But before we dive into the album itself, let's talk a bit about Wolf People. Formed in 2006 and hailing from London, these guys have been making music together for over a decade. They've experimented with various sounds and genres, and it all comes together beautifully in 'Tidings'. You can hear the influences of Led Zeppelin, Cream, and even King Crimson in their music, but they put their own spin on things.

'Tidings' wasn't just thrown together arbitrarily, but rather it was meticulously crafted over the course of a year. It's a concept album of sorts, telling the story of a man's journey through life and death. The album opener, ""Morning Born"", sets the tone perfectly with its slow, steady build-up. From there, the album takes you on a journey through various moods and emotions. Some tracks, like ""Kingfisher"" and ""All Returns"" are energetic and upbeat with catchy guitar riffs, while others, like ""Thief"" and ""Night Witch"" are dark and brooding, with haunting vocals and eerie melodies.

Wolf People's lyricism also shines through in this album, with thoughtful and introspective verses throughout. There are some really great tracks on this album, but I'll admit that it's not all perfect. At times, some of the tracks can feel a bit meandering or unfocused. And while the band's experimentation with folk and psychedelic elements is certainly interesting, it doesn't always hit the mark.

All in all, I'd give 'Tidings' a solid 6.4 out of 10. It's not an album for everyone, but if you're looking for something a bit different in the rock genre, then this could be the perfect fit. It's clear that Wolf People put a lot of time and effort into crafting this album, and it shows.

Gord Downie,Secret Path,Rock,8.0,October 29 2016,Brad Nelson,Contributor,"In 2014, Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene approached Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie about recording an album. Downie said he didn’t think he had any songs. “But,” he said, “I have been writing about Charlie.” “Charlie” is Chanie Wenjack, a boy who, in the 1960s, was separated from his family and placed in the Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in Kenora, Ontario. His name was warped into the misnomer “Charlie” by his teachers. One day he escaped the school and tried to walk home. His family lived 400 miles away. He never made it. The album that Drew and Downie made, Secret Path, is, in Downie’s words, “an attempt to capture the feeling, somehow, of trying to get home.” The first residential schools appeared in Canada in the late 1800s, and the system survived until the mid-1990s; children were removed from their families and placed in distant boarding schools administered by local churches and funded by the federal government. The schools were developed to “take the Indian out of the child”; teachers forbid the students from speaking or writing in their native language and educated them exclusively in white culture and Christianity. The students suffered physical and sexual abuse; many died from disease, which spread recklessly through the schools. Others committed suicide. The Canadian government stopped recording the deaths of children in residential schools in 1920, and many of the original records have been lost or destroyed. A recent commission estimated that up to 6,000 children may have died while living in residential schools, and earlier this year a state of emergency was declared in the indigenous community of Attawapiskat after 11 people attempted suicide on the same day; one of the cited reasons for the suicide attempts is the lingering, cross-generational trauma of residential schools. Downie tells Chanie’s particular version of this story by developing its sense of place. The compositions on Secret Path feel more like haunted environments than songs; it sounds as if Downie, Drew, and the Stills’ Dave Hamelin—all of whom supply most of the instrumentation—are all wandering through these spaces with Chanie. (This quality might’ve been transferred to the recordings by Drew, whose albums with Broken Social Scene have such a strongly defined sense of place that listening to them feels like visiting individual cities.) The instruments, mostly acoustic guitar and piano, are recorded in such a way that they produce atmospheres out of minimal playing. Piano chords drone and occasionally sound as if they’d been reduced to their own echo, wrapping the songs in a kind of musical shadow. This is the most severe and spartan context that Downie’s sang in since his solo debut, 2001’s Coke Machine Glow, and his words for the most part land in the scenery as haunted, disconnected fragments. Downie, as a lyricist, is traditionally remarkable for his density. Unlike fellow Canadian poet Leonard Cohen, he is not particularly interested in space, and unlike fellow Canadian lyricist Joni Mitchell, his songs aren’t delivered by or assembled around characters. His work is rarely about himself, and in fact seems to flow from a composite perspective, a sensibility that shifts so often that it resists characterization or stability. He takes literature, history, and geography, and compresses them into living, shapeshifting jigsaw puzzles. A lyric from “Christmastime in Toronto,” from his 2003 solo album Battle of the Nudes: “With your dark epiphanies/Your true lines of smoke/Your glistening rails and streetcars all aglow/Always the wind and the persistent snow/Gets into your eyes and your mouth and every fold of your coat.” At least half of that line is from Chekhov, and the other half is a mundane image of winter in Toronto ascending into a realm of magic realism. On Secret Path, Downie’s words have a sudden respect for space; they never veer from Chanie’s story. In the first song, “The Stranger,” Downie resists projecting onto Chanie, and the lyric produces an ambiguity and anxiety that feels true to the theoretical feelings of a lost 12-year-old: “And what I’m feeling is anyone’s guess/What is in my head?/And what's in my chest?.” But Downie is also capable of reducing the narrative to a single heartbreaking detail, as in the title track, where Chanie seems to wrestle with the definition of the word “windbreaker” as he’s assaulted by wind and frozen rain (“Doesn’t do what they said it’d do/It’s just a jacket”). Downie’s more direct lyricism may also respond to how Secret Path itself a story of space—of the distance between Chanie and his family, of the yawning space between his footsteps as he walks over a seemingly infinite stretch of train tracks. The image of the train tracks is provided by artist Jeff Lemire, who illustrated a graphic novel around the album; Lemire wordlessly depicts Chanie’s life before and after escaping the residential school in elliptical, repeating images and rhythms: one Chanie and two other students on a swing set, just before they escape the school; one of a raven, which may or may not be Chanie’s hallucination, drifting in and out of the minimal, monochrome landscape, sometimes carrying a pair of articulated eyes in its beak; and one of Chanie’s father, who is a hallucination, and who materializes out of the only soft petals of color in the book. There’s an uncanny loneliness in Lemire’s pictures and in Downie’s words. “I can see my father’s face/Warming his feet by the stove,” Downie sings in “I Will Not Be Struck.” “We used to have each other/Now we only have ourselves.” He’s describing a kind of distance, a kind of space that can’t be filled or healed. In August of this year, the Tragically Hip played what is potentially their final show, which took place in their hometown of Kingston, Ontario. Downie had been diagnosed a few months earlier with glioblastoma multiforme, a terminal brain tumor characterized by necrotizing tissue forming around aggressive, undifferentiated cells, and which in x-rays appears as a shadow swimming through fluorescent regions of the brain. Downie’s memory was compromised; he remembered his lyrics through teleprompters that were arranged around the stage. In between songs, with 11.7 million Canadians watching the concert through the CBC broadcast and its attendant stream, he started to improvise; Downie identified Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the audience, and admonished him to start repairing Canada’s relationship with its indigenous population. “It’s going to take us 100 years to figure out what the hell went on up there,” Downie said. “But it isn’t cool and everybody knows that. It's really, really bad, but we're going to figure it out. You're going to figure it out."" Secret Path, it seems, is Downie’s own way of figuring it out.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22537-secret-path/,Arts & Crafts,2016.0,"Gord Downie has always been a bit of an enigma in the Rock world. His unique style and poetic lyrics have captured the hearts and minds of many, but his latest album, 'Secret Path,' is a whole new level of artistry.

Before diving into the album itself, it's important to understand the history behind it. The album is a tribute to Chanie Wenjack, a young Indigenous boy who died trying to escape from a residential school in 1966. Downie first learned about Wenjack's story after reading Ian Adams' 'The Lonely Death of Charlie Wenjack' and was moved by the heart-wrenching tale of a young boy who died so tragically. This inspiration eventually led to the creation of 'Secret Path.'

The album itself is a beautifully crafted masterpiece. The Rock genre is prevalent throughout, but Downie has infused a touch of acoustic, folk and even a hint of country music into the mix, creating a unique and enchanting sound. The songs themselves are all breathtaking and moving, with each one capturing the emotion behind Wenjack's story.

The opening track, 'The Stranger,' sets the tone for the rest of the album, with its hauntingly beautiful melody and Downie's signature deep, raspy voice. Personal favorites include 'Swing Set,' 'The Only Place To Be' and 'Secret Path,' where Downie's raw emotion is particularly evident.

As a listener, I was captivated by the story of Chanie Wenjack and amazed by the incredible attention to detail that went into every aspect of the album. The music and lyrics were written in collaboration with Jeff Lemire, a graphic novelist who created a stunning graphic novel to accompany the album. The combination of music and art creates a truly unique experience, with the visuals adding an extra layer of emotion and depth to the already moving story.

In conclusion, 'Secret Path' is a gem of an album that should not be overlooked. It is a testament to the power of music and storytelling, and a reminder that some stories need to be told. Gord Downie and Jeff Lemire have created a work of art that is not only a tribute to a young boy who lost his life but also a call to action for the injustices that continue to plague our society. I highly recommend this album to any fans of Rock or anyone who appreciates a truly powerful story told through music.","1.

The Antlers,Burst Apart,"Experimental,Rock",8.2,May 12 2011,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Brooklyn's indie scene can feel like a series of bands each trying to be hipper than the next, but thankfully nobody told Pete Silberman. In the dog days of 2009's deadbeat summer, the Antlers frontman emerged from his bedroom with his third LP, Hospice. On it, he unfashionably embraced hackles-raising choruses and concept-album ambition, and he pushed the button on emotional nuclear options: abortion, cancer, death, all that fun stuff. Now a trio, the Antlers have claimed the influence of ""electronic music"" for Burst Apart, a typical omen for a typically ""difficult follow-up album."" But while Burst Apart sheds the PR-bait bio and Arcade Fire aspirations that made its predecessor a word-of-mouth success, it's still tethered to a magnanimity and expressive clarity that makes it almost every bit as devastating. Lead single ""Parentheses"" didn't do much to show their hand; it's pretty misleading out of context. Sounding like a higher-BPM ""Climbing Up the Walls"", the knockabout electronic percussion and tweaked piano ripples rightfully marked some connection to the post-OK Computer, pre-Kid A application of Mo' Wax and Warp textures to alt-rock song structures. But the aggression in Silberman's falsetto and the gnarly guitar distortion are revealed as total outliers, and Burst Apart can actually be seen as Hospice turned inside out: Where before, long swathes of calm white noise linked emotive outcries, Burst Apart moves patiently through luxurious downtempo tones belying some serious romantic disturbance. Those well-versed in dream journal interpretation could gather that from the mere title of ""Every Night My Teeth Are Falling Out"" (a common symbolic manifestation of sexual frustration). After all, Burst Apart does open with ""I Don't Want Love"", a heartbreaking wallow in a numbing hangover from a singer who previously seemed doomed to feel too much. Its glistening melody at least helps it scan as pop, but ""Parentheses"" and ""Every Night"" feel cut from the same cloth as the Walkmen's ""The Rat"", holding onto sanity with white knuckles, sexual congress seen as mutually assured destruction. Aside from those, Burst Apart's atmosphere is nocturnal and desolate. Foreboding death-crawl ""No Widows"" fears for vehicular disaster; brief flickers of light are allowed full exposure on the gorgeous, incantatory centerpiece ""Rolled Together"", whose brushed drum work and silvery guitars could be heard as a studiously completed homework assignment on Agaetis Byrjun. Meanwhile, the tender, nearly beatless balladry of ""Hounds"" and ""Corsicana"" are wholly the Antlers' own and painfully pretty to behold-- however depressive Silberman's lyrics, one can simply revel in the zero-gravity synth and vocal moans and feel some sort of uplift. Shame that it makes Burst Apart's missteps all too egregious. This isn't the sort of record that calls for a show-stopping power ballad, but we get one anyway with ""Putting the Dog to Sleep"", where needlessly histrionic vocals and an overwrought doo-wop progression come off more like last call karaoke than a fitting closer. If nothing else, ""Putting the Dog to Sleep"" helps point toward the Antlers successfully making Burst Apart more about their growth as a band than a gripping backstory-- for all of Hospice's raw power, it didn't leave much to the imagination, and it either hit you right in the gut or not at all. The Antlers won't hold your hand through Burst Apart, which will inevitably make it more of a grower, but stick around-- it's all the more affecting for how it allows you to pick your own stumbling, lonely path.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15411-burst-apart/,"Frenchkiss,Transgressive",2011.0,"Indie rock darlings The Antlers have returned with their third album, ""Burst Apart."" Described as an experimental rock album, it pushes the boundaries of the genre and serves as a testament to the band's growth and artistic evolution. Clocking in at just over 46 minutes, this album takes the listener on a journey through a lush, atmospheric soundscape, with haunting vocals and intricate instrumentation providing the perfect backdrop.

As someone who has been following The Antlers' career since their early days, ""Burst Apart"" is a striking achievement. The band's origins were solidified with their 2009 concept album ""Hospice,"" which explored the theme of love in the middle of tragedy. Since then, the band has released two additional albums and undergone a significant transformation. While previous albums had a raw, stripped-down feel, ""Burst Apart"" features a more polished sound with a focus on layering of instruments and a greater attention to detail.

According to lead singer and primary songwriter Peter Silberman, ""Burst Apart"" was inspired by a series of personal struggles and life experiences. This is evident in the album's lyrics, which are hauntingly introspective and full of emotion. From the melancholic ""I Don't Want Love"" to the ethereal ""Rolled Together,"" each track has a unique feel and meaning that is carefully crafted and executed.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""No Windows."" It is a six-minute epic with an eerie instrumental interlude that builds to an explosive conclusion. The layering of sounds creates a sense of depth and complexity that is typical of the ""experimental"" label. Silberman's delicate vocals are perfectly complemented by the intricate instrumentation.

Another highlight is ""Putting the Dog to Sleep,"" which serves as the perfect closing track. It is a melancholic ballad that exemplifies the band's growth as storytellers. The lyrics are raw and honest, and the instrumentation builds in intensity throughout the song. The closing refrain of ""Prove to me I'm not gonna die alone, put your arm around my collarbone"" is a powerful statement on the fragility of human connection.

Overall, ""Burst Apart"" is a testament to The Antlers' growth and maturation as a band. It is a hauntingly beautiful album that combines introspective lyrics with lush, atmospheric instrumentals. While fans of the band's earlier work may miss the rawness and immediacy of their previous albums, this album stands on its own and firmly cements the band as a force to be reckoned with. With a rating of 8.2 out of 10, it is a must-listen for fans of both indie rock and experimental music genres.","1. Review A is more verbose, using longer sentences and more complex ideas.

King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard,Nonagon Infinity,Rock,8.0,May 4 2016,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"Since the advent of digital music, all media players have been outfitted with the Repeat function—whether it’s a button on a traditional CD player, or those circular lines you click on in your iTunes app. I’m willing to bet no one has ever activated this feature on purpose, yet it always seems to mysteriously switch itself on. The effect is always jarring, the contemplative post-listen pause rudely interrupted by an abrupt jump back to the opening track. It’s the ultimate useless proof-of-concept innovation, something that exists simply because it can. But as it turns out, whichever technicians invented this functionality were onto something—because they were effectively preparing us for the advent of King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard’s Nonagon Infinity. Over the course of eight wildly divergent albums, the Melbourne psych-rock septet have fed the past 50 years of rock history through a paper shredder and seamlessly taped the strands back together in intriguing new patterns, even leaving in the parts (bluesy harmonica slobber, flute solos, jazz odysseys) that more cool-conscious retro-rock revivalists would excise. And through experimenting with myriad sounds, they’ve also started experimenting with album formats. Last year’s Quarters! presented four prog-pop suites each clocking at exactly 10 minutes and 10 seconds. But Nonagon Infinity ups the high-concept ante to absurd extremes. While pieced together from discretely recorded, separately titled songs, the record is mixed to feel like a continuous 41-minute live performance, complete with recurring musical and lyrical passages. And it’s the first album in history to give you a legitimate, practical reason to hit that Repeat button—*Nonagon Infinity *is constructed as an infinite loop, meaning its final notes connect perfectly with the album’s opening. But independent of that gambit, *Nonagon Infinity *is the Gizzard’s most ballistic, berserker album to date, a merciless, atomic-bomb erasure of the pastoral terrain traversed by its flower-powered predecessor, Paper Mâché Dream Balloon. In their most hot-wired moments (see 2014’s I’m in Your Mind Fuzz), King Gizzard have earned copious comparisons to their former label patrons Thee Oh Sees, and here frontman Stu Mackenzie punctuates almost every chord change with an echo-drenched, John Dwyer-esque “wooo” like a dancehall selector pushing the air-horn button. But on Nonagon Infinity, they assume a more mechanistic precision and sinister, metallic force—all the better to reinforce the lyrics’ '70s sci-fi cartoon-show universe of robots, monsters, and hidden dimensions. Ironically, for an album that functions as a shrine to record-collector rock, *Nonagon Infinity *operates on the same principles as a club DJ set, weaving in and out of different melodic motifs while remaining locked (for the most part) into a propulsive, breakneck rhythm that sounds like Devo riffing on Hawkwind’s “Motorhead.” When it’s running at peak velocity—which is like, 90 per cent of the time—*Nonagon Infinity *yields some of the most outrageous, exhilarating rock ‘n’ roll in recent memory, on par with modern psych-punk touchstones like Comets on Fire’s Blue Cathedral, Thee Oh Sees’ Carrion Crawler/The Dream and Ty Segall’s Slaughterhouse. It’s a preview of what our not-too-distant future of hyperloop travel will feel like—this is a record that requires protective seat belts, induces G-force ripples in your cheeks and drives fingernails into armrest upholstery. But the band’s gonzo attack never overpowers Mackenzie’s psych-pop accessibility, as he spits out a stream of fragmented hooks like a combusting jukebox of British Invasion singles going on the fritz. If anything, his melodic change-ups provide crucial orientation markers on this endless Autobahn of a record. The band also possess an innate sense of knowing just the right moment to switch things up, like with the loose Krautrock boogie that introduces “Mr. Beat,"" or the twinned Allman Brothers leads dropped into the “TV Eye”-style surge of ""Evil Death Roll,"" or the Yes-worthy contoro-riffs that overtake “Invisible Face”. (That said, the incense-scented Santana jam that breaks out partway through the latter piece constitutes the record’s only forced detour.) Ultimately, the question of how the band will reconcile the chugging, roadhouse-razing closer “Road Train” with the album’s motorik opening proves moot—in Nonagon Infinity’s final minute, the Gizzard effectively bring the former to a dead stop and then just quickly work themselves back up into the album’s familiar high-octane groove. At first, it feels like a bit of a cheat—a switcheroo the band could’ve conceivably dropped at any point in this piece, rather than a natural climax they’re working toward. But the instant Nonagon Infinity resets back to its blitzkrieged beginning, the gimmick’s greater purpose is revealed: this is the first album whose intro actually doubles as its crescendo. And *Nonagon Infinity *is overstuffed with so many stomach-tossing thrills that you’ll actually be jonesing to ride the roller-coaster all over again.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21853-nonagon-infinity/,ATO,2016.0,"Nonagon Infinity by King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard is a masterpiece of avant-garde rock that deserves every bit of its 8.0 out of 10 rating. I have to say, this is one of the most exhilarating albums I have ever listened to.

The band itself is quite an interesting group, hailing from Melbourne, Australia, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard has been making music since 2010. The band's sound is hard to pin down but is often described as a combination of psychedelic rock, garage rock, and even some elements of jazz fusion. Nonagon Infinity is their ninth album, and it was released back in 2016, just two years after their previous album, Paper Mâché Dream Balloon.

What makes Nonagon Infinity such a unique album is its conception. The album was designed to be an infinite loop, where the last track seamlessly flows back into the first, creating an endless listening experience. Each song seamlessly transitions into the next, with a driving beat that pulls you forward. It is essentially an emotional rollercoaster, taking the listener through a variety of moods, rhythms, and experimental sounds.

The title track, ""Nonagon Infinity,"" the first track of the album, sets the tone for what's to come. It's a relentless, pounding rhythm that propels forward with a sense of urgency. The song is full of layers of guitars, keyboards, and drums that create a dense, textured wall of sound. The energy doesn't let up from there, with tracks like ""Gamma Knife"" and ""People-Vultures"" pushing the limit of avant-garde rock.

One of the standout tracks of the album for me is ""Mr. Beat."" The song has a catchy bass line that sucks you in and then explodes into a wild cacophony of sound. It's the kind of song that gets into your head and won't let go. The buildup at the end is particularly thrilling, with a wall of sound that sounds like an entire stadium of people clapping and chanting.

In conclusion, Nonagon Infinity by King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard is an adventure of an album that takes risks and delivers something unique and exciting. It's not for everyone, but for those who appreciate experimental rock music, this album is a must-listen. I found myself lost in the endless loop, swept up in the journey the band created.

Duster,1975 EP,Rock,7.1,November 22 1999,Mark Richard-San,,"Some bands... you want them to change. Though you may have loved their initial sound, it gets tired after a few records and you find yourself hoping they'll try something new to stave off your boredom. Other bands-- bands like Duster... you like what they have going and hope they stay the course. Duster's slow, noisy and frayed sonic sludge is a thing o' beauty for those willing to look closely enough, and while their 1975 EP shows not a whit of growth from their two previous 7"" or their 1998 debut, Stratosphere, it still delivers the sad space rock goods in fine form. The only minor adjustment on 1975 is a slight- but- noticeable shift to a more song- oriented, and less sonic- dependent environment. On tracks like ""Memphis Sophisticate"" and ""And Things (Are Mostly Ghosts),"" the lyrics are clear and easy to discern, a rarity for a band this in love with distortion and cheap recording methods. Both these tracks jettison the layered guitars and meandering organ for a more stripped down approach, and while this uncluttered backing highlights what turns out to be pretty fair songwriting chops, something of Duster's singular identity is lost in the process. Yeah, these are good songs, but they sound like they could have been recorded by any number of other ""slow"" bands. Ultimately, Duster make their name as a band that focuses on the blurry edges around the picture and leaves the deeper meaning to the imagination. ""The Motion Picture,"" with drums that crawl by like a wounded sloth and an indiscernible vocal track that cuts in and out in double time, is closer to the Duster I've grown to love. Same goes for ""August Relatively,"" which uses the timeworn technique of backward drums to lend an otherworldly feel to the skeletal melody. But ""Want No Light to Shine,"" the EP's closer, is by far the highlight: with a gentle organ filling the spaces left by a nervous, trembling guitar, it seems so fragile it could disappear at any moment. And then it does, into a lovely coda played on an upright piano, a heartbreaking ending to another fine example of the Duster sound.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2494-1975-ep/,"Up,Up",,"When Duster released their self-titled album over 25 years ago, they were ahead of their time. Their blend of space rock, shoegaze, and lo-fi left audiences in awe and made them one of the most intriguing bands of the 1990s. Fast forward to 2019, and the release of their ‘1975 EP’ continues to live up to those expectations. 

The ‘1975 EP’ is a sonic trip that is sure to take listeners on a journey, with laid-back grooves and dream-like production. Listening to it feels like you've stumbled upon a band of legendary status, who somehow went undiscovered for years. But the story of Duster is not just a story of an underappreciated band. It's a story of circumstance, and how things just happen to fall into place. 

Duster formed in 1996 in San Jose, California. The band consisted of three members: Clay Parton, Dove Amber, and Jason Albertini. They were initially a punk band, but soon discovered their love for experimental music. By 1998, they released their debut album, ‘Stratosphere,’ to critical acclaim. Their second album ‘Contemporary Movement’ was released in 2000, and they disbanded soon after. 

After breaking up, each member of the band pursued different projects. Clay Parton continued to make music under his own name, Dove Amber recorded under the name M. Behrens, and Jason Albertini played with other well-known artists like Built to Spill and Helvetia. It's a surprising comeback for the band then, when they released the ‘1975 EP’ in 2019.

The ‘1975 EP’ features three new songs, along with a few previously unreleased tracks, all recorded between the years 1995 and 1996. When listening to it, one can’t help but feel like they're unearthing a lost tape that's been hidden away in a closet for decades. The band's sound is unmistakable, despite the EP's antiquity. The guitar melodies are dream-like, the drums steady, and the vocals are delivered in a whispery shoegaze style. 

The EP starts with the track ‘Moon Age,’ a short instrumental that sets the stage for the rest of the album. The track leads you into the second song ‘Miki Dora,’ which has a gentle guitar riff and a catchy chorus that will get stuck in your head for days. The final new song, ‘Summer War,’ has a slower tempo than the first two, but still retains the same atmospheric quality that Duster is so well-known for.

The previously unreleased tracks ‘Dream Sequence’ and ‘Landspeeder’ sound like they could have easily fit on their debut album 'Stratosphere', showcasing the band's signature sound with hazy, distorted instrumentation, and reminiscent lyrics. Meanwhile, ‘Hesitate’ was originally released as a B-side, but is a standout track on the EP. The slow strumming guitar creates an ethereal atmosphere, with vocals impressively embodying a dark vibe unique to the band. 

Overall, the ‘1975 EP’ is an incredible comeback for Duster that feels perfectly at home in the music landscape of 2019. For fans of the band, it's a sought-after addition to their discography. For those new to the band, it's a great stepping stone into discovering their influential brand of music. The EP excellently bridges the past and present, and leaves listeners eager to see what comes next. solidifying the EP's 7.1 rating as well-deserved.","1.

Camera Obscura,Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi,Rock,7.5,October 20 2004,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"A few years before Underachievers Please Try Harder whispered its greeting to bookish girls and the boys who write sestinas about them, there was another Camera Obscura record. In those days, the wispy Glaswegian septet numbered merely six, and local boy-with--arab-strap-made-good Stuart Murdoch produced an early single (""Eighties Fan"") and arranged strings for them but wasn't yet shooting their album covers. Upon its release, U.S. listeners could only find this fine indie pop outing while exchanging shy glances in particularly well-stocked imports aisle. Thankfully, Merge has finally dusted off the group's UK breakthrough for American release, and although the record is narrower in scope than its follow-up-- which hopscotches from Leonard Cohen to The Supremes-- it still sparkles. On their charmingly understated first date, Camera Obscura hew more closely to their contemporaries than their 1960s influences. Winsome, acoustic-driven songs such as ""Swimming Pool"" and ""The Sun on His Back"" fit comfortably alongside fellow bedsit pop acts like The Guild League, The Fairways, and of course, Belle & Sebastian. Tracyanne Campbell's stiff-lipped vocals even evoke those of The Softies' Rose Melberg, particularly on ""Let's Go Bowling"" (one of the reissue's two bonus tracks, along with ""Shine Like a New Pin""). Here, Camera Obscura play their teen-romance cards close to their hope chests; the line between earnestness and artfulness is indeed thin. Like B&S;'s best (there I go again!), the sprightly ""I Don't Do Crowds"" could be an anthem for Victorian Lit majors-- or an ironic pleasure for disaffected hipsters just finding ""I'm a Cuckoo"" via its Avalanches remix. But more likely, it's both. Campbell, who shares vocal duties with John Henderson, adds to those delicious double layers on opener ""Happy New Year"", offering this one-of-a-kind couplet: ""Did you know I could be a lot of fun?/ I'm aware that friendship can die young."" Elsewhere, ""Double Feature"" waxes precious about Catherine Deneuve and winter, and ""Houseboat"" takes an outsider's look at the fun lovin' found in Christine McVie-penned Fleetwood Mac. A dispute over Nancy Sinatra provides the chorus to ""Anti-Western"" (""I'm taking your boots off,"" Campbell retorts), and ""Pen and Notebook"" works in a winning Johnny Marr namedrop over halting piano, which is later joined by swirling orchestration that runs the risk of boring any chamber-pop Philistines still in the audience (their loss). ""Eighties Fan""-- the single that brought Camera Obscura to the notice of John Peel-- has a drum opening that could have played over the Lost in Translation credits. Because of its connection to Murdoch, it's the best-known of these early tracks but there are a half-dozen songs on Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi that are just as good. Very few of them, however, capture the band's songwriting strengths-- placing a modern lyrical twist on the 1960s arrangements of Bacharach, Webb, and Hazlewood-- as well as ""Eighties Fan"" does. Come to think of it, very few tracks on Underachievers do either.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1749-biggest-bluest-hi-fi/,"Andmoresound,Andmoresound",2001.0,"Are you ready to dive into the whimsical world of Camera Obscura?

Hailing from Glasgow, the band was formed by Tracyanne Campbell and Gavin Dunbar in 1996. The name, Camera Obscura, is inspired by the French term for a device used by artists to project an image of the surrounding environment onto a flat surface. Their music is a perfect reflection of this, as they use their lyrics to capture the beauty and trials of life and project it back on to the listener.

The creation of 'Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi' began in 2000 when the band secured a record deal with Andmoresound Records. They worked closely with producer Stuart Murdoch of Belle and Sebastian fame, who helped them refine their sound and gave them the confidence to make music that was uniquely their own.

From the onset, it's clear that Camera Obscura have a knack for crafting catchy melodies and weaving them together with clever and introspective lyrics. The album's opening track, 'Suspended from Class', immediately sets the tone with its jangly guitar riffs and Campbell's honeyed vocals. It's easy to get lost in the music, but when you pay close attention to the lyrics, you realize that they tackle heavy themes like loneliness and rejection.

The standout track on the album is undoubtedly 'Eighties Fan'. The nostalgic undertones of the song serve as a perfect complement to the catchy chorus, making it impossible not to sing along. It's no surprise that it remains a fan-favorite and is still played at Camera Obscura's live shows.

Another special mention goes to 'Pen and Notebook', which sees Campbell's quirky sense of humor come to the fore. The song's playful melodies belie the serious message about acceptance and self-love.

Personally, 'Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi' is one of those albums that I reach for on a gloomy day when I'm feeling a bit blue. There's something so comforting about the way Camera Obscura weave together melancholy and hopefulness, creating a soundscape that invites you to stay a while and feel all the feelings.

In conclusion, if you're looking for music that stands the test of time and captures the magic of the human experience, 'Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi' should be at the top of your playlist. With their debut, Camera Obscura managed to create a piece of art that manages to be both timeless and contemporary. It's no wonder that 20 years later, their music still resonates with so many listeners. I'd give this album a solid 8 out of 10.","1.

The Lemon Twigs,Go to School,Rock,7.0,August 25 2018,Sam Sodomsky,Associate Staff Writer,"Go to School, the sophomore album by Long Island duo the Lemon Twigs, is a musical about a monkey, but there’s a twist: It’s actually about us. Like the cinephilic siblings of The Wolfpack and the precocious outcasts of “Home Movies,” the brothers in the Lemon Twigs—19-year-old Michael and 21-year-old Brian D’Addario—see the world most clearly when it’s filtered through their own charmingly warped lens. Listen to Go to School on a surface level, and you’ll get the tale of an adolescent chimp, raised by humans, who gets his dreams crushed and his heart broken before returning to nature in a symbolic blaze of freedom and destruction. Give the album your full attention, however, and you’ll hear two young musicians settling into their gifts as they challenge the rapidly expanding worldview they share. There’s a frenzied, competitive energy to the D’Addarios’ songwriting, which cycles through melodies and moods at a hyperactive pace. Their debut album, 2016’s Do Hollywood, resembled a solid acting reel, showing glimpses of narrative without ever offering a full story: Their range was the point. They’ve been associated with revivalists like Whitney and Foxygen, but the charm of the Lemon Twigs is in the unabashed, theater-kid fun they have with their record collection, an energy that guides their work more than any particular style. It’s a whimsical take on what we categorize as “classic rock” that feels more akin to turn-of-the-millennium Elephant 6 acts—particularly Gay Parade-era of Montreal—than to the Lemon Twigs’ self-consciously serious peers on the festival circuit. They value costume changes over fancy light shows, bargain bin novelties over the Rolling Stone canon. They have five favorite Beatles songs, and all but one of them are pre-Revolver. Following the Jonathan Rado-produced patchwork of Do Hollywood, Go to School plays like an exercise in conceptual and musical focus. The D’Addarios recorded the whole thing directly to tape in their family’s basement and enlisted both of their parents as collaborators. (Their father, songwriter and session musician Ronnie D’Addario, helped track the record; their mother, Susan Hall, voices the chimp’s mom.) The resulting album is less dynamic than Do Hollywood, but its scuzzier, live-band approach brings the Lemon Twigs’ sound closer to that of their heroes. “Queen of My School” could pass for an Alex Chilton solo trifle, while the swirling chorus of “The Student Becomes the Teacher” would be at home on an early Todd Rundgren LP. In fact, Rundgren and Big Star drummer Jody Stephens guest on the record, the former gamely assuming the role of the primate’s father. Their participation feels as much like a flex on the brothers’ part as a gesture toward authenticity: These are our peers, the D’Addarios imply, with devilish confidence. Occasionally, the Lemon Twigs put too much emphasis on imitation. As evidenced by the connection Michael has cited between his burgeoning Neil Young fandom and his interest in army jackets, their influences can feel like superficial touchstones without a unifying inspiration to link them. And sometimes the brothers lose the plot. The pace of Go to School should be familiar to anybody who’s gotten too stoned with a friend and spent an hour riffing on the same joke: One moment you’re choking with laughter; then, suddenly, you’re sighing, inexplicably exhausted, unable to remember what you found so funny just a second ago. A stretch of songs in the middle of the record pairs familiar melodies with rote morality in a way that feels oddly detached for a band known for expressing its enthusiasm in sets studded with high kicks. Whether the D’Addarios are indulging in pure plot exposition (“What a big mistake/My taking in an ape”) or twisting clichés to keep things interesting (a bully is surprisingly sentimental, a love scene humorously vulgar and nonsensical), individual tracks can suffer under the weight of the narrative. What’s more unfortunate than the monkey musical’s excessive length is that you might not find yourself humming any of the melodies after it’s over. Only when the Lemon Twigs go for broke do you hear what they’re capable of. The album’s climax arrives with “The Fire,” six minutes of proggy, theatrical Southern rock that feels distinctly heartfelt—a quality the duo often downplays throughout these songs. Despite their new penchant for storytelling, the Lemon Twigs aren’t seeking wisdom in Go to School (and thank god for that). But there’s more going on here than initially meets the eye. Michael recently confessed his aversion to contemporary rock music, and you can hear why he might find less resonance in the genre’s current torchbearers than in its early underdogs—artists who weren’t made for their times but found a way to transcend them anyway. Go to School portrays the D’Addarios’ fellow human beings as sad, helpless, and, at their worst, brutally ignorant. In their lyrics, the brothers whiplash between cynicism and wonder, earnestness and absurdity. While the Lemon Twigs’ sound is far older than their years, this set of concerns is remarkably age-appropriate as they enter their 20s and look toward the future: Where is our place in the world? How do we find our way without losing our spirit? They raise these questions repeatedly, then answer them with a goofy solo and a joke about bananas. Sounds about right.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-lemon-twigs-go-to-school/,4AD,2018.0,"When The Lemon Twigs first emerged onto the music scene a few years ago, they were something of an enigma. The band was made up of two teenage brothers from suburban Long Island with a peculiar mixture of retro and modern influences, creating a sound that was both familiar and unique. Now, with the release of their sophomore album ""Go to School,"" The Lemon Twigs have solidified their place as one of the most exciting rock acts around.

The album tells the story of Shane, a young ape raised as a human whose life is transformed when he goes to school. It's a concept album in the truest sense, and it's remarkable how cohesive and engaging the story is. The Lemon Twigs have always been ambitious with their music, but ""Go to School"" takes things to another level entirely.

As the album unfolds, we hear the perspectives of various characters in Shane's life, from his cruel classmates to his loving but troubled mother (played by Todd Rundgren!). The Lemon Twigs have always been adept at capturing different moods and emotions, and here they're stretched to their limit. There are explosive rock songs (""Small Victories""), tender ballads (""Wonderin' Ways""), and everything in between.

What's most impressive about ""Go to School,"" though, is how well The Lemon Twigs balance their influences. There are nods to classic rock, musical theater, punk, and even hints of hip-hop, but it never feels like a pastiche. The band's songwriting is so strong that even when they're seemingly aping their heroes, they're always putting their own spin on things.

It's hard to talk about ""Go to School"" without mentioning the sheer theatricality of it all. This is an album that demands to be heard in full, preferably with the lyrics in front of you. It's a story that's both timeless and timely, dealing with issues of identity, acceptance, and the difficulties of growing up. There are moments that will make you laugh and moments that will break your heart. It's an album that rewards repeated listens, as you pick up on new details and connections.

Ultimately, ""Go to School"" is further proof that The Lemon Twigs are one of the most exciting and innovative bands of their generation. It's a towering achievement, a bold and adventurous concept album that never loses sight of the raw honesty and emotion that makes rock music so powerful. It's a must-listen for anyone who cares about the future of the genre, and once it gets its hooks in you, it won't let go.","1. Both reviews are written in a natural and logical manner.

Hell on Wheels,The Odd Church,Rock,7.4,September 29 2006,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"On Hells on Wheels' third album, The Odd Church, there's a moment when the verse of ""Perversion"" careers into the chorus like a rollercoaster hitting a freefall. The music sounds like it's being pulled along by gravity as much as by the musicians themselves, who might as well be screaming and waving their hands in the air as they take that plunge. It's a thrilling passage, and the fact that the next five songs contain similar moments robs it of exactly none of its power. Living up to the band's name, side one of The Odd Church is full of great blasts of manic guitar and manic-er melodies, played with breakneck abandon by a group with the unlikely talent for referencing a range of influences-- the Pixies, the Ramones, Phil Spector, even Belle & Sebastian here and there-- while sounding completely confident and vital. The Swedish trio sells their hooks by sheer force of will, ratcheting up the tempo and the drama as Rickard Lindgren and Ã…sa Sohlgren trade lines like Black Francis and Kim Deal playing Tracy and Hepburn. After the feint of the subdued but sarcastic ""Heard You on the Radio"" and the self-propulsion of ""Perversion"" comes ""Alexandr"", about an admirably literate athlete; Lindgren laments ""Most people of acquired taste have the anatomy of walking canes"" like he's Stuart Murdoch-- with all the biting wit and brainy humor that comparison implies. He and Sohlgren nail the coda of the time-traveling ""As We Play"" as if they're all too aware of the folly of band life: ""At least we didn't die away"" sounds like a determined dream they've not yet realized. With Lindgren's scribbling guitar and Johan Risberg's pummeling drums, ""Come On"" ends the first side with an indie grandeur that's a perfect climax to a this-close-to-perfect run of songs. If The Odd Church had ended here, or if it had continued on in that same vein, it would be easy to extol its virtues unguardedly. But this isn't an EP, it's an album, and an ambitious one at that. Starting with ""At Least You Still Pretend You Care"", Hell on Wheels take a different sort of precipitous drop-off, abandoning their concise structures and headlong rush for a plodding pace, vague synth atmospherics, and rangier, less urgent songs. Well, maybe that's not exactly fair. The songs have their moments-- like the stuttering rhythms of the impressively obscure Yaz cover ""Tuesday"" or the disappointing realizations on ""Handing Over the Heart"" that love isn't really about ""Tearing off the shirt/ Cutting up the chest""-- but they suffer their proximity to side one, which means it's impossible to hear them on their own merits. But that's praising with faint damnation. In truth, side two sounds fine, if less immediate, less tuneful, less frenzied. You wait for the crucial freefall, but get a bit of a letdown instead.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9392-the-odd-church/,Hybris,2006.0,"Welcome to the world of Hell on Wheels, a band that embodies the grit and glory of rock n' roll. With their latest album, ""The Odd Church,"" they continue to prove themselves as a force to be reckoned with.

Hell on Wheels has been around for years, carving out a reputation as one of the most exciting and unpredictable rock bands on the scene. Their sound is raw and intense, rooted in the classic rock of the '70s but with a modern edge that makes it all their own.

As for ""The Odd Church,"" the album was created during a pivotal moment in the band's history. The members were going through some personal struggles, but they channeled their emotions into the music, resulting in an album that is both raw and cathartic.

The opening track, ""Broken Bones,"" immediately draws you in with its pounding drums and blistering guitar riffs. Lead singer Jack's vocals are powerful and filled with passion, setting the tone for the rest of the album.

One of the standout moments on ""The Odd Church"" is ""Into the Deep,"" an epic ballad that showcases the band's softer side without losing any of their trademark intensity. The lyrics are haunting and introspective, and the simple acoustic guitar accompaniment perfectly supports Jack's voice.

For me, the true gem of the album is ""Ghost Town,"" a haunting and mesmerizing track that perfectly captures the feeling of being lost and alone. The music swells and soars as Jack's vocals reach a fever pitch, and the result is absolutely spine-tingling.

Overall, ""The Odd Church"" is a solid addition to Hell on Wheels' discography. The band has never been one to shy away from their emotions, and this album is no exception. It's a raw and gritty exploration of the human experience, delivered with the kind of intensity and passion that only a truly great rock band can muster.

In terms of a rating, I would give this album a 7.4 out of 10. While it's not perfect, it's still a fantastic addition to any music lover's collection. If you're a fan of rock music or just looking for something new and exciting to listen to, then ""The Odd Church"" is definitely worth a listen.","1.

The Botticellis,Old Home Movies,Rock,7.0,July 9 2008,Adam Moerder,Contributor,"In the spirit of classifying any remotely poppy album released between May and August as a ""summer album,"" Old Home Movies really hits a sweet spot right about now. There's surfer reverb, slouching croons, and sunny melodies all over the Botticellis' debut album, and, to top it off, the band hails from San Francisco. Written over the last four years in between day jobs, Movies proves an airtight first effort, the band's deliberation is apparent in every shrewdly placed nook and cranny. Frontman Alexi Glickman possesses a fitting nursery rhyme cadence for the band's nostalgic surf pop. Named after a barrel-shaped wave the band finds particularly gnarly, the Botticellis wouldn't know stormy weather if it rained on their bonfire. The opening title track bounces along like a Walkmen track fresh out of rehab, Glickman's rosy reminiscing unaffected by lyrics about Alaska and snow. ""New Room"" shows off saccharine hooks on par with the Shins yet sharing the lethargic quality of Papercuts' Jason Quever, who coincidentally provides some spot drumming and engineered the album with Scott Solter. At its strongest, the band manages to inject its happy-go-lucky sound with at least a few pangs of sadness and/or mystery. ""When I Call"" crawls through spikey guitar arpeggios and a haunting vocal from Glickman, so sedated it could pass for a Yo La Tengo track. Glickman pulls off some great British Invasion-like gems, too, aided by the fact that his voice eerily resembles George Harrison's or, one of the most Beatles-esque non-Beatles, Jeff Lynne. ""Flashlight"" and ""Who Are You Now"" share ELO's grandiose interpretation of the fab four's pop sensibilities, though it's considerably tempered by the Botticellis' laid-back vibe. The main beef here, if you want to call it that, is the tendency to sometimes lapse into nondescript MOR. ""Stay With My Brother"" and ""Tongue Is Blue"" match the album's lax pulse, but wander aimlessly in a comfort pop zone. Glickman's charisma also hasn't quite caught up yet with his songwriting, either, making for lots of memorable hooks couched in a limited range of expression. There's basically soothing and slightly louder soothing, which is fine if you don't mind investing next to nothing in lyrics or dramatic climaxes. Despite these setbacks, there's nothing to despise about these fresh-faced upstarts-- and really not much to gush over, either-- but Old Home Movies meets its sun-soaked influences with a firm high-five. Hot dogs on the grill, anyone?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11971-old-home-movies/,Antenna Farm,2008.0,"Hey there, music lovers! Today, I'm excited to share my thoughts on the latest album by The Botticellis called 'Old Home Movies'. This band has been making waves in the rock music scene, and this new album justifies their loyal fanbase.

The Botticellis, formed in San Francisco, are best known for their unique blend of 60s pop and modern indie rock. This album, their third studio release, further cements their position as one of the best rock bands in the world. It's a real treat to see a band grow and mature while staying true to their sound - something that is hard to come by in the current music industry.

'Old Home Movies' tells a beautiful story of nostalgia and memory. From the first track ""The Fall"" to the last track ""China,"" the album exudes a distinct sense of introspection and longing. The standout tracks for me were ""Turn Left Turn Right,"" ""Films"" and ""The Rule of Twos"". The tracks are all perfectly crafted, with catchy hooks and emotional lyrics that stick with you long after the album is over.

The band's decision to self-produce the album speaks volumes about their artistic vision. The arrangements are rich, and the sound is vibrant. From the lush guitar melodies to the pulsing bass grooves, every song is a testament to the band's exceptional musicianship. The lyrics of the album are raw and honest, and I particularly appreciate how the vocals sit in the mix.

As someone who grew up listening to The Beatles, The Kinks, and The Zombies, I couldn't help but notice the band's affinity for those bands' sounds. This is particularly evident in the vocal layering and harmonies that echo the harmonic structure of '60s pop music. However, what sets The Botticellis apart is their ability to blend the past and the present seamlessly, creating a sound that is both nostalgic and fresh.

Overall, 'Old Home Movies' is a beautiful collection of songs that showcases The Botticellis' musical prowess. From the lyrics to the music, every element is thoughtfully curated, and the result is an album that is a cathartic experience. If you're a fan of sophisticated rock music, you need to give this album a listen - I'm giving it a 7.0 out of 10.","- Review A uses more casual language and includes references to pop culture, such as mentioning The Walkmen and Papercuts.
- Review B uses more formal language and includes more technical descriptions of the music, such as discussing vocal layering and harmonic structures.
- Review B also includes more personal reactions and opinions, such as saying that the album is a ""cathartic experience"" and giving it a specific rating.

Man Man,The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face,"Experimental,Rock",8.0,December 8 2004,Nick Sylvester,Contributor,"I have two recurring dreams. The first: my feet are mysteriously attached to a skateboard (Birdhouse deck, Thunder trucks, 55mm Creature wheels) and no matter how hard I try not to, I somehow land every trick-- even the physically impossible ones. The second: I am walking down the Ocean City boardwalk when I see a band of bums napping in cardboard boxes. In the dream, I think to myself, ""Wait a second. A band of bums..."", and suddenly I turn into a bum and convince the other bums to start a band with me. The bums are reluctant. Then there's a fight of some sorts, then there's the kissing, and seconds later I wake up holding my hunting rifle and a copy of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. The skateboarding dream always made sense to me, but the band of bums one I don't know, I just never understood the appeal. Things started to click two years ago. In real life, Philly band Man Man, then performing as Gamelon, would show up for gigs with about 50 people in tow, half of them pushing shopping carts filled with recyclables, the other half carrying musical instruments straight off the Island of Misfit Toys: legless upright pianos, bent horns, clarinets made of human flesh, etc. I imagine that several of these instruments were trash-picked or, at the very least, made from pieces of trash. Man Man played songs that sound like Tom Waits, Captain Beef, and Frank Zappa, but there was something earthier about them, something twisted and gross and grimy (but not that kind of grime). Tom Waits' songs are heavyweight boxing matches we watch on pay-per-view; Man Man's debut, The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face, is an epic street battle between two Vietnam war vets fighting over who gets to sleep on the sewer grate. Brand me with a scarlet R-- ""R"" for Rockist, the target-du-jour of East Coast music-writer McCarthyism-- but I'm struck most of all by Man Man's honesty. Lead singer Honus Honus isn't trying to sound like Waits; he really just can't sing, and the screams and grunts are his best approximations. Man Man doesn't play guitars on these songs either-- not because they're trying to get the CMJ ""New Ideas in Indie Rock"" wheels spinning, and not because they're parodying that Chicks On Speed song-- but because guitars are expensive and bar chords probably bore them. Several Men-Men in Man Man have moustaches. This isn't Vice Party hyper-irony though; this is December in Philadelphia, and their upper lips are cold. Funny thing is, Man Man are spinning wheels. Trade in the six-strings for some trumpets, violins, and preschool choirs, and songs like opener ""Against the Peruvian Monster"" come along: strong melodies play off droopy rhythms, and the screemy-meemy call-and-response exchanges at the end sound scarier than Alien Vs. Predator, maybe even Leprachaun 2. On ""10lb Moustache"", Man Man kitchen-sinks saxophones, marimba bells, animal sounds, and stolen Steinways into a dirty-mouthed theme song for mutiny. ""Zebra"" cops Fiddler's avant-klezmer dog barks and clarinet melodies for Love Gone Wrong, and tops them off with bluesy bitterness: at the end, a freaky chorus sings, ""You stung me bad/ What can I do?/ But leave the stinger in/ So I won't forget you."" ""Gold Teeth"" takes the bright kindergarten melodies of ""Peruvian Monster"" and covers them in Coketown soot. The song could be about anything with lines like ""Her hips are a warm sarcophagus"", but Man Man, for all the song's fingernail dirt, rusty shaves and sleepwalking, still sound really tender. These are songs kids like Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger listened to before crying themselves to sleep. For the second half of Man in a Blue Turban With a Face, Man Man trade up melody for mania. The band touches on Need New Body territory before mustering the album's most focused narratives. The gritty-gorgeous ""I, Manface"" is a first-person Roman tale of a boy raised by wolves, and the similarly involved ""Werewolf (On The Hood Of Yer Heartbreak)"", Man Man's throaty doo-wop closer, goes something like, ""You're a diamond in the rough, baby/ A werewolf on the prowl, come and save me"", but with the charm of say Elvis' ""Don't Be Cruel"", or the Drifters' ""Under the Boardwalk"". Sounds crazy, I know, maybe even impossible. But just remember: under the boardwalk, down by the sea, there are probably bums sleeping, so try not to wake them.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5621-the-man-in-a-blue-turban-with-a-face/,Ace Fu,2004.0,"The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face by Man Man is an album that encompasses the creative and experimental nature of rock music. This album is a perfect representation of the band's ability to experiment with sound and push the boundaries of what is perceived as traditional rock music.

From the very first track, ""Feathers,"" we are immediately drawn into the unconventional world of Man Man. The use of horns, percussions, and guitars gives a sense of chaos and disorder, but somehow, it all seems to work seamlessly together. The track sets the tone for the rest of the album, which takes us on a journey through a kaleidoscope of sounds and emotions.

Man Man has always been known for their unapologetically quirky and avant-garde style, and this album is no exception. The band was formed in 2003 by lead vocalist Ryan Kattner, and since then, they have been making music that defies the norm. This album marks their fifth studio release and is a representation of the band's musical evolution since their debut.

One of the most unique aspects of this album is the way it was created. The album was recorded in a remote cabin in the woods of Washington State. The isolation and seclusion allowed the band to fully immerse themselves in the creative process and explore new sounds without any outside distractions. This approach is reflected in the raw and natural feel of the album that transports the listener to a world that is both surreal and ethereal.

As someone who's been a fan of Man Man for a while, I have to say that The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face is by far their most polished work yet. The production quality is outstanding, and every instrument, every sound, every note is deliberate and intentional. Each song is like a painting that is intricately crafted with layers of sounds and emotions.

One of my personal favorite tracks is ""Head On (Hold On To Your Heart),"" a song that starts with an upbeat and catchy melody, and then takes a sharp turn into a haunting and emotional chorus. The way the song builds up and explodes into a frenzy of sound is nothing short of breathtaking.

Overall, The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face is an album that challenges the listener's perception of what rock music can and should be. Man Man's ability to seamlessly blend genres and create music that is both catchy and experimental is what makes them one of the most exciting bands in the music scene today.

Pictureplane,Technomancer,Electronic,5.9,November 2 2015,Hazel Cills,Contributor,"The world that these songs on exist in, as Pictureplane’s Travis Egedy sings to us, is a dead one (where, of course, people get it on in the ruins of a shopping mall). The arrangements on Technomancer frequently play like droning or piercing alarms, particularly on tracks like “Sick Machine” and “Death Condition,” the latter of which is laden with clunky, mechanical percussion that makes it sound like a vintage video game. Whereas Pictureplane’s 2011 record Thee Physical spun queer and cyborg theory into fuzzy house-inspired electronica, Technomancer plays like a soundtrack to a sci-fi dystopian film. It works well as a concept record about trying to break out of one’s oppressive urban regime, with Egedy weaving his whispery conspiracy theories into every track. But while Pictureplane’s signature ’90s-evoking female vocal samples might sing soulfully in the distance, the record feels drained of the energy his previous albums showcased. The common setting on Techomancer is slowmo, with most tracks favoring ethereal, romantic ’80s synths over the pumped up, choppy compositions on Thee Physical. Even the breakbeat intro on “Harsh Realm” cuts out a minute in, favoring a more chilled out, awkward see-saw synth progression before returning to the sound of the song’s start. The blaring airhorns and record scratching sounds on “Street Pressure” feel like they’re working against the soft, sultry melody Egedy builds on that song, like a jokey nod to traditional club music. All of this seems at odds with the sound Pictureplane has cultivated thus far. There’s a tame, almost downtempo vibe to a lot of this record that keeps it from beginning to end in a sluggish, not very dance-friendly territory. Technomancer is certainly Egedy’s most nicely produced output yet, with his voice coming through stronger than ever on a lot of these songs. “Crack all the windows downtown, it’s that new American noise,” he sings to a “renegade street trash” on the more traditional, radio-friendly pop track “Riot Porn.” But the noise of Technomancer just plays too comfortably. Technomancer is very high concept in its man vs. machine dystopian themes, but the darkwave-edged beats Egedy constructs, while bleak, don’t possess the same level of imagination. In seemingly trying to make more cinematic and visionary electronica he ends up making pretty lackluster, slow-burning pop. On Technomancer Egedy’s typically wire-frayed, wall-of-sound ’90s mixtape sound feels stripped into something more pedestrian rather than futuristic.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21162-technomancer/,Anticon,2015.0,"Are you ready to be transported into the world of electronic music? Look no further than Pictureplane's Technomancer. This album is a journey through the depths of electronic sounds and rhythms, melding together various genres and influences to create a truly unique listening experience.

First, let's delve into the history of Pictureplane. Travis Egedy, the man behind the moniker, has been creating his own style of electronic music for over a decade. He's known for his unique blend of genres, ranging from experimental and noise to dance and techno. Technomancer marks his fourth full-length album, and it's clear that Egedy has honed his sound over the years.

The creation of Technomancer also holds a personal significance for Egedy. The theme of the album focuses on the use of technology as a means of escape, a sentiment that Egedy himself has grappled with in the past. Through the use of psychedelic and futuristic elements, the album explores the nuances of our modern relationship with technology - a topic that feels especially pertinent in our current climate.

Now, let's turn our attention to the music itself. The album has a cohesive quality to it, thanks in part to the underlying theme. Standout tracks include ""Chaos Radical,"" ""Dead Yet,"" and ""Harsh Realm,"" all of which showcase Egedy's ability to create hypnotic, mesmerizing beats that carry the listener away. There's a pulsating energy to the music that's sure to get you moving, and yet it's also enveloping and almost meditative at times.

Of course, as with any album, there are moments that don't hit the mark quite as well. Some tracks feel a bit too drawn out, lacking the same level of energy and atmosphere as others. Additionally, while the album as a whole is certainly unique and innovative, it doesn't quite reach the same level of artistic excellence as some of Egedy's previous work.

Overall, Technomancer is a solid effort from Pictureplane. While it may not be his best work to date, it's still an engaging and intriguing listen that's sure to satisfy electronic music enthusiasts. It's a testament to Egedy's talent and willingness to experiment, and there's no doubt that he'll continue to push the boundaries of his craft in the years to come.","1.

Merzbow,Merzbuddha,Experimental,6.8,July 25 2005,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Having heard 15 Merzbow releases give or take, which is probably on the order of 7% of his output, I'm probably not qualified to make any pronouncements about Masami Akita's body of work. But I have heard enough to say that few of the early assumptions I had about his music are true. At first I figured that all his records must essentially sound the same, but it turned out he's probably more eclectic than your average artist. And while I initially had it in my head that noise music is foremost an expression of rage, Merzbow's work runs the emotional gamut. Much of the time, in fact, I would describe it as essentially neutral in terms of affect. As Dominique Leone pointed out in his review of A Taste of Merzbow, ""if any musical fabric binds [his records], it is that of total determination to assault the listener's senses."" Merzbow is essentially a psychedelic artist, attempting to create shifts in consciousness through extreme sound. Using the Merzbow records I know as a barometer, *Merzbuddha is a comparatively stable and measured work. Three long tracks all bear the title ""Mantra"", and the recurring element through each is an ungodly deep and loud three-note bass pulse, around which is wrapped all sorts of whooshing and buzzing noises. I'd heard the whole record via ripped mp3s several times without grasping the full extent of this bottom end; once I finally played the CD on a stereo with a subwoofer as loud as seemed responsible in my apartment building, I developed a completely different understanding of the record. Akita has indicated that he was listening to a great deal of dub around the time he recorded * Merzbuddha, and if that's true this record is another example him taking the core elements of a beloved genre (he's toyed in the past with free jazz and prog samples) and smashing them to barely recognizable pieces in the Merzbow style. Which is not to say that Merzbuddha could ever have you feeling anywhere close to Irie, and god help the person who finds ""Mantra 1"" on the stereo with a head full of THC. Though there are few unpredictable blasts of noise, Merzbuddha suggests more of a simmering paranoia, the ceaseless march of bass suggesting the B-movie monster that manages to keep pace with a fleeing victim despite moving almost in slow motion. There is a lot of steam and hiss throughout, like steam escaping from a coal-belching machine, and the crackles around the bass bring to mind a record stuck in a run-out groove. Only in the last five minutes of this almost hour-long composition does Akita finally remove the governor, letting chaotic sheets of static and ear-splitting metallic scrapes overwhelm the carefully constructed rhythm. Given the title of the album and the series of three ""mantras,"" and given the inside cover photo that shows Akita in a darkened temple kneeling in supplication, we're left to wonder: Is this final assault the sound of enlightenment? Don't know about that, but an hour of good Merzbow, which this is, certainly has a transformative effect.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5248-merzbuddha/,Important,2005.0,"Experimental music can often be polarizing; it can challenge our expectations and conventions, leaving us feeling unsettled or intrigued. The newest album from Merzbow, ‘Merzbuddha’, is no exception. With a rating of 6.8 out of 10, it's certainly not everyone's cup of tea. However, for those willing to dive into the world of experimental music, this album is not one to miss.

Merzbow, the alias used by Japanese noise musician Masami Akita for over 30 years, has created a profound impact on the experimental music landscape with his groundbreaking noise compositions. His music has been described as ""harsh"", ""unconventional"" and ""non-musical""; however, his sonic creations have always be connected to the underlying principles of art, philosophy and of course, sound experimentation.

Merzbuddha, his latest album, seems to encapsulate all of these aspects of Merzbow's music perfectly. The album has been created using a mixture of noise and power electronics, with the sound of distortion being amplified to great effect. One of the things that makes this album stand out is the prominent use of traditional Japanese flutes, which are in stark contrast to the chaotic noise of the electronic instrumentation.

The album is a perfect blend of traditional and contemporary sounds, with Merzbow incorporating exotic elements in his noisy musical productions. One can’t help but be impressed by the sheer depth and complexity of the soundscapes he creates. The textures are thick, and the tones are harsh, yet there is immense beauty in the sonic architecture created by Merzbow.

Personal experience-wise, Merzbuddha was an intense journey. From the very first moments of the album, it immersed me in a world of unrelenting noise that subsided only upon the final moments of the album's closing track. The album's overall length of 80 minutes can feel overwhelming, but that's the point: to create an immersive listening experience, one that feels challenging but ultimately rewarding. It can be challenging for those who prefer familiar musical motifs, but loyal fans of Merzbow will find the album rewarding, while newcomers can experience something unique and truly different.

Overall, I believe ‘Merzbuddha’ is an album that one must approach with an open mind and an appetite for something new, something that breaks with traditional musical conventions. Merzbow has always been known for his uncompromisingly inventive approach, and with this album, he continues to push the boundaries of what we think of as music, creating a soundscape that is raw, chaotic, and at times, relatable.","1.

Busdriver,Jhelli Beam,Rap,6.2,June 12 2009,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"I doubt there will be a record I hear this year that's topping the sheer word count of Jhelli Beam, and yet the line that feels the most revelatory comes courtesy of someone who isn't Busdriver. On ""Least Favorite Rapper"", guest Nocando spits, ""The suburban kids say I'm not street enough/ But compared to them, I'm street as fuck."" It's that combination of self-awareness, self-deprecation, and, ultimately, self-defense that's played a large role in defining the Busdriver Experience over nearly a decade of way-left-of-the-dial hip-hop. Though too bizarro for mainstream acceptance, it actually works in his favor; as much as Busdriver appeals to the technically obsessed purists, he might even hold as much appeal for people who'd otherwise avoid hip-hop completely. Still nothing's gonna stop Busdriver from critiquing just about everybody outside of the Project Blowed collective-- an aim that makes Jhelli Beam feels at times less than laser-guided. ""Least Favorite Rapper"" initially sounds like it's got a serious case of the Paul Barmans-- check the blood-curdling opener: ""These sneaker geek MCs to me are so Brokeback/ So fuck sexy, in '09 I'm bringing broke back."" But the reason it actually ends up being funny (Nocando is ""vibing witcha like Michael Richards"" before letting off a Tommy-gun blast of the word that ended his career) lies in how it sounds like it's actually parodying indie rappers complaining about strawmen (""He sells more drugs than the FDA/ He's ready for war like FDR"") than making an actual critique of the mainstream rap scene. At least I hope that's what it is: These guys do realize the Next Great Hope (as of June 2009) of hip-hop played a wheelchair-bound high school kid on a Canadian sitcom, right? As always, Busdriver is about as technically impressive as an MC can get, the cultural vocabulary of DOOM funneled through Doseone's vocal dexterity (though as a singer, Bus is far more unhinged). Hey, I love both of those guys, but there's a reason you don't hear too many people thinking they should borrow from each other. I can think of a handful of times where I can hardly believe that this stuff can be listened to for enjoyment-- Bus plays cat and mouse with Mozart's ""Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major"" on lead single ""Me-Time"" with stunning agility, and while it's admittedly the kind of thing you'd like to see him pull of live, I can't so much vouch for him appropriating Carl the Groundskeeper's gopher song from ""Caddyshack"" (""Handfuls of Sky"") or ""This Old Man"" for a tribute to Project Blowed loyalty (""I've Always Known""). ""Art rap!"" he declares at the beginning of ""World Agape"", as if you couldn't tell from the erratic jazz-tom rolls that comprise its two and a half minutes. But it's tough to tell just how much Busdriver's in on the joke-- the very first words of Jhelli Beam are ""conscious rap failed us,"" and later on, he sneers ""underground rap happened 10 years ago"" before admitting that people in his position get ""no kudos for being a pseudo-commie"" despite functioning ""under the awning of [his] moral high ground."" Thanks to typically club-evasive but inventive beatmaking from long-time associates Nobody, Daedalus, and Nosaj Thing meshing wonderfully with Busdriver's torrential flow, Jhelli Beam somehow can be enjoyable just as an in-one-ear-out-the-other experience; you can enjoy the clap-happy cadence of ""Manchuria"" or ""Quebec And Back""'s goblin-like vocal effects completely worry free. But once you get yourself involved, there's no turning back-- you just brave the storm of proper nouns and pop culture detritus to the point where it's a Girl Talk-style game of ""oh, hey-- I recognize that!"" but not a Girl-Talk-style listen for, well, pleasure. The question then become whether you can maintain interest in how much effort Busdriver exerts to get across... god knows what. It takes a couple of pushes on the rewind button to cobble together how ""Dane Cook table reads"" and ""anal beads"" can constitute a rhyme, let alone ""bouillon cubes,"" ""oolong tea,"" and ""Moveon.org."" Why should I call him ""Scoliosis Jones""? Taken in context with just about everything else, it's another reference to Busdriver willing to let his freak flag fly, but since when was clarity such anathema? Particularly in a situation where the heads that Bus seeks out are equally into a rap classic that boasted, ""I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin'"" as they are into the ""spiced out Calvin Coolidge/ Loungin' with seven duelers"" classic. In the end, yes, Jhelli Beam manages to be a completely cerebral experience and at times overwhelming in a satisfactory way, but then again, you could say the same about ice cream headaches.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13228-jhelli-beam/,Anti-,2009.0,"If you're a fan of rap music that is uniquely weird and challenging, then Busdriver's 2009 album 'Jhelli Beam' might just be the perfect concoction for your musical palette. I recently revisited this album and was again struck by how relentlessly creative and singular it is in its approach to hip-hop.

For those unfamiliar with Busdriver, let's start with a brief background. The Los Angeles-based rapper, whose real name is Regan Farquhar, has been a mainstay in the underground rap scene since the late 1990s. He's known for his lightning-fast, dizzying wordplay, esoteric references, and off-kilter sense of humor. Busdriver is not rap in the traditional sense, but rather his tracks are a heady brew of experimental electronics, jazz, breakbeats, punk, and even classical flourishes.

'Jhelli Beam' is Busdriver's sixth studio album, and was his first release on the highly regarded indie label ANTI-. According to the rapper, the album was inspired by a desire to push his sound in a more electronic and futuristic direction. The result is an album that sounds both alien and highly emotive.

The album opens with the track ""Split Seconds (Between Nannies and Swamis)"", which begins with a delicate, almost gossamer-like intro before erupting into a barrage of frenzied rapping. Other standout tracks include ""Me-Time (With the Pulmonary Palimpsest)"", a track that showcases Busdriver's incredible breath control and lyrical acrobatics, ""Least Favorite Rapper"", a cutting dissection of the rap game, and ""Unsafe Sextet/Gilded Hearts of Booklovers"", a nine-minute epic that incorporates elements of jazz, spoken word, and opera.

One aspect of 'Jhelli Beam' that I find particularly intriguing is its use of electronic textures and synth sounds. At times, the album almost sounds like a lost relic from some dystopian future, with warbling synths and glitchy beats providing a fitting backdrop for Busdriver's surreal lyrics. Yet, for all of its strangeness, 'Jhelli Beam' never veers too far into avant-garde territory, remaining rooted in the hip-hop ethos.

In conclusion, I highly recommend 'Jhelli Beam' to fans of experimental rap looking for something outside the norm. Busdriver is a rapper's rapper, and this album is a testament to his singular vision and creativity. For those willing to give it a chance, 'Jhelli Beam' will reward with its many delights, both strange and sublime. While it's certainly not an album that will appeal to everyone, for those that ""get it"", it's a true gem of the genre. My rating for this album is 7 out of 10.","1.

Noveller,A Pink Sunset For No One,Rock,6.5,February 18 2017,Thea Ballard,Contributor,"With each successive release, the self-sustaining universe that is Sarah Lipstate’s output as Noveller pushes outward. Her instrumental sound—built from guitar loops run through pedals—has evolved well past its drone-anchored early incarnation. That relied on layers of distortion to create meditative spaces that enveloped the listener; more recently, synths and percussion have entered her sprawling compositions. A Pink Sunset for No One is ruled by a newly epic sense of scale and narrative. For better or for worse, the album’s more intricate details are at times overshadowed by its glimmering crescendos. However, the tension between Noveller’s roots as an intimate bedroom project and the outsize shape it takes here is compelling: even if her style has grown to fill the kind of rooms one might play opening for Iggy Pop, it still feels like a dreamworld Lipstate has built primarily for herself. Opener “Deep Shelter” begins with a low-pitched four-note phrase that repeats throughout, accumulating iterative details that begin to soar outward from the humble introduction. Four minutes in, these loops pull back to make way for a gently cinematic piano bridge: self-soothing, yes, but executed in a remarkably high-definition way. There’s also a heightened sense of energy, Lipstate spending less time luxuriating in her guitar’s textures and more on developing big-picture structure. “Rituals,” which winks at Steve Reich, is anchored by soft, distant percussion and a small chorus of staccato riffing, punctuated by blasts of rippling sustained notes. On “Trials and Trails,” perhaps the album’s most technically impressive track, Lipstate solos heroically over distorted passages, the juxtaposition throwing the liquidity of her playing into relief. The variety of genres and sounds that emerge within her compositions give Lipstate’s work a multitextured feel, but in moments I found myself wishing for more concision in the way such ideas are digested. Experimental forebears like Reich or Rhys Chatham (with whom she’s performed, in his Guitar Army) are a natural influence, but on songs like “The Unveiling” and “Corridors,” Lipstate’s usual spaciness takes on an almost-proggy feel; meanwhile, the title track feels like a crisp take on a Slowdive instrumental. Clearly, Lipstate has the technical prowess to pull off a near-infinite range of styles. As she shakes off the distortion that might have once smoothed over their messier intersections, the issue becomes, perhaps, how to tastefully marry them. But that’s not to say that there isn’t a solid sense of self at this record’s core. Its closer “Emergence” is slow but not sleepy, fluttering melodies dancing around its murky base. It’s a pleasure to listen in to the small melodic details folded into its dominant humid texture, but it also feels, as a whole, reassuring: a sound that’s big and confident without relying on excess to sway its listeners, or itself.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22903-a-pink-sunset-for-no-one/,Fire,2017.0,"Alright fellow music lovers, buckle up and get ready for an epic journey with Noveller’s “A Pink Sunset For No One” album. The band, led by Brooklyn-based guitarist and composer Sarah Lipstate, has carved a unique niche for themselves in the world of experimental rock. This album, which received a 6.5 rating out of 10, is a mesmerizing soundscape that effortlessly blends various genres and delivers a truly captivating listening experience.

But before we dive into the album itself, let's take a moment to talk about the band and the album's creation story. Noveller was formed in 2005, gaining momentum as a solo act before turning into an ensemble in 2009. Since then, the band has released multiple EPs and albums, and the journey that we get to hear in “A Pink Sunset For No One” surely reflects the expertise and growth that the band has garnered over the years.

The album itself was released in 2017 and features nine tracks that paint a vivid picture of Sarah Lipstate’s imagination. The opening track ""Deep Shelter"" is bound to leave you mesmerized as it builds with layers of guitar effects and electronic elements, creating a wall of sound that is both powerful and hypnotizing. This track is a strong promise of what lies ahead in the album.

What follows next is a journey through different moods and textures. Whether it's the energetic and chaotic ""Rituals,"" the soothing and atmospheric ""Emergence,"" or the dynamically introspective ""Trails and Trials,"" each track offers a distinctive sound palette that takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride. The album has a dream-like quality to it, with each track seamlessly transitioning to the next, inducing a trance-like state that doesn't let up until the final crackle of the outro.

One of my personal favorite tracks on the album is ""Corridors,"" which features a cinematic quality that conjures images of wandering through a maze-like structure. The swirling guitars and pulsating drums crescendo into a wall of sound, providing a sonic representation of the atmospheric effects of light and shadow within physical space. The track beautifully demonstrates the band's ability to create soundscapes that are both epic and dynamic.

Overall, Noveller's ""A Pink Sunset For No One"" album is a perfect representation of experimental rock. It's like being gently pushed out of the realm of the familiar and into a world of infinite possibilities. The album is brilliantly crafted and delivers a cohesive sonic landscape that takes you on an emotional journey from start to finish. And while the rating of 6.5 out of 10 may not seem high, I can attest that this album is a masterpiece that deserves to be listened to again and again.","1.

Robert Pollard,We All Got Out of the Army,Rock,7.3,February 18 2010,Paul Thompson,Contributor,"An avalanche of records from Robert Pollard's projects-- the stellar Boston Spaceships, the extra skronky Circus Devils, a few one-offs and curios, and several records under his given name-- isn't a new thing. But the clip at which they've arrived lately seems almost superhuman. And while he's not immune to the occasional failure, since late 2008 or so Pollard has enjoyed a late-career renaissance, consistently rewarding those of us still paying attention. Messy though the sonics can be, there is something very deliberate about the construction of Pollard's recent work; even last summer's haywire Elephant Jokes felt like an attempt to capture the clipped construction of his muddy mid-90s masterpieces. We All Got Out of the Army, his first solo album of 2010, is a gleaming and hefty glam-pop record without the rough patches and rushed moments and that can bog him down, and it's among his most deliberate yet. ""Silk Rotor"" starts the album with an amicable enough guitar chug before exploding into a weighty stomp; after a string of fine LPs with less than stellar first tracks, it feels good to dive right into this one. ""Post-Hydrate Update"" lopes around into a nice series of hooks, and the thwacky ""Your Rate Will Never Go Up"" is similarly catchy. ""On Top of the Vertigo"" is one of Bob's best vocal performances in years, the gnarly track thrashing against an aside-laden tale of ""sleeping in a puddle of puke."" ""How Many Stations"" is a true lighters-in-the-air moment, while the manic title track might well inspire a mosh pit should this new studio rat incarnation of Pollard tour again. And ""Wild Girl"", a stripped-bare piece of melancholia that suggests Syd Barrett doing ""Across the Universe"", might just be the best tune here. A fine lot of Pollard songs is one thing, but it's gotta sound right, and right-hand-man Todd Tobias, working from his new studio, lends these numbers just the right amount of flash and grit. Unlike last year's The Crawling Distance, which found Tobias dressing up a drab grab-bag of Pollard tunes in the most utilitarian arrangements imaginable, the music here works against the songs beautifully. It's fuller, brighter, more nuanced, and more natural, closer to the much-loved Isolation Drills than almost anything else that's come since. And Pollard actually straps on a guitar and lets a few solos fly, a show of effort and personal involvement practically unheard of in the period immediately following Guided by Voices' split. Pollard's a loopy guitar player, favoring feel over form, but his personal touch helps to offset Tobias' steady hand. It wouldn't be a Pollard record without inspiring a raised eyebrow or two. The not quite right ""Rice Train"" is a little too weird to be wonderful, and ""Talking Dogs"" feels slight, as befits the set's shortest number. A few tunes, while not exactly sleepwalkers, seem driven by autopilot. Most egregiously, ""I Can See"" nicks the central riff from Pollard's best and most recognizable song, Bee Thousand's ""I Am a Scientist"", pretty much wholesale; it'd be a lousy trick if the tune that followed weren't pretty good, although, of course, ""Scientist"" it ain't. But if we're getting to a point where the worst thing you can say about a Bob Pollard record is that it's got a tune that reminds you of his best work, well, clearly we're getting somewhere. Last year was a good one for Pollard, and with a record like We All Got Out of the Army coming right out of the gate, 2010 is shaping up nicely.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13937-we-all-got-out-of-the-army/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.",2010.0,"If you're a fan of Robert Pollard, then you'll be no stranger to his penchant for crafting short and sweet rock songs that thrive on the power of the hook. After all, this approach helped him produce many of his most beloved songs as the frontman of alt-rock legends Guided By Voices. Now, with his latest album We All Got Out of the Army, Pollard proves that he's still got the gift for making infectious and catchy rock tunes.

One of the things that makes this album stand out is the way in which Pollard expertly blends his classic rock influences with his own unique sensibilities. There are shades of the Kinks, the Beatles, and the Who here, but these nods to the past never feel like mere imitation. Instead, Pollard seems to be simultaneously nodding to his heroes while also carving out his own legacy as a songwriter.

The album's title track kicks things off with a dose of classic rock riffage, before giving way to ""Good Luck Sailor"", which proves to be another highlight with its driving guitar and Pollard's sprightly vocals. ""The Big O Gets An Earful"" is a humorous departure, with its wry lyrics and sing-song delivery, but it's still just as catchy as the rest of the album.

But perhaps the true standout of the album is ""Sideways Surprise"", which showcases Pollard's gift for crafting memorable melodies and delivering them with a sense of effortless cool. It's just the kind of song that could easily get stuck in your head for days on end.

Overall, We All Got Out of the Army is a solid rock album that strikes a balance between Pollard's classic rock leanings and his own unique sensibilities. It's not quite as groundbreaking as some of his earlier work, but it's still an enjoyable and engaging listen. Fans of the genre and Pollard's previous work will likely find much to enjoy here.","1.

Radiator Hospital,Play the Songs You Like,Rock,6.0,October 27 2017,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"Sam Cook-Parrott has quietly built up a bit of reputation in recent years among people who like their scrappy underdog pop-punk with a tender heart on its sleeve. Torch Song, the breakthrough album that his Philly band, Radiator Hospital, released in 2014, featured a highly endearing breakup song, “Cut Your Bangs,” amid guest appearances by Katie and Allison Crutchfield. Since then, Radiator Hospital have cut a split EP with likeminded British DIY-pop group Martha, while Cook-Parrott has lent his bed-headed backing vocals to sweetly shambolic tunes by Fred Thomas, Allison Crutchfield, and, perhaps most visibly, Japanese Breakfast. He also released a self-titled album as one-half of duo the Afterglows. The stage would seem to be set for Cook-Parrott to translate this cachet among indie-pop peers to a wider audience. Play the Songs You Like, the first full-length Radiator Hospital LP since Torch Song, once again teams Cook-Parrott with fellow guitarist-vocalist Cynthia Schemmer, drummer Jeff Bolt, and bass player Jon Rybicki. Like its predecessor, it’s packed with short, energetic songs that tend toward bashful yearning. Cook-Parrott’s slurry squeak of a voice, which many first heard on Waxahatchee’s 2013 album Cerulean Salt, remains a distinctive instrument, and there’s a spirited sincerity to these songs that should keep the already-converted bouncing around mistily in ramshackle venues. But the group’s highest-profile release to date feels strangely like a missed opportunity. Although Play the Songs You Like is 16 tracks long, they tend to blur together. That’s true of the fast songs, such as the snare-snapping “Out of Mind,” where Cook-Parrott slurs about waking up “with your picture in my mind,” or the bristling “Lonely Road,” which finds him out there “talking to myself.” But it’s also true of the more midtempo, Byrds-descended tunes, like the dreamily resigned “Nothing Nice,” with its closed-down comic book shop, or “Cheap Day,” a ringing reminiscence on an image in an old magazine. The sharp songwriting voice behind Torch Song—the one that put the kick into “You say you’ll cut your bangs/I’m calling your bluff,” on that album’s kiss-off standout—feels less present here. Maybe those bangs got cut after all. There are a few welcome changeups—the patient space-out “Also Ran,” the winsome Schemmer showcase “Half Empty,” the mumbly acoustic ballad “Heart of Darkness”—but they come across as just that, changeups from a formula that’s not quite working. Some of Radiator Hospital’s best work in the past has made reference to the ways that music intertwines with memory, going back to “Our Song” and “Down Again” from 2013’s partly self-recorded Something Wild. But here the meta-songwriting seems a tad counterproductive. In one consecutive three-song stretch, we get “Pastoral Radio Hit,” which has a buoyant Shins-like chorus melody; “Old Refrain,” which is enjoyably rambunctious; and “The Songs You Like,” which waxes nostalgic for those nights when a particular piece of music sounded best. None are much more memorable than their placeholder-like titles. (When the Chills called a song “Heavenly Pop Hit,” at least it was actually heavenly pop, dangit.) A few tracks later, “The People at the Show” rips into someone who’s “talking… damn near screaming.” Like much of the rest of this album, that line comes across as well-intentioned and decent, but ultimately uninspiring. It certainly wouldn’t be enough to quiet the loudmouth in the back of the bar. Sadly, that remains the case even when Radiator Hospital play a song that some indie-pop diehards may already like. The penultimate track, “Sycamore,” is a fine cover of a song by Martha, whose Blisters in the Pit of My Heart was one of last year’s underappreciated gems. It’s a nice gesture of friendship, but the 2013 original managed to convey its jittery internal conflicts more distinctively, without sounding so much like yet another 1990s indie-rock pastiche. “In between the notes of your favorite song/You try and figure where it went wrong/But it went wrong long ago in many different ways,” Cook-Parrott sings at the start of “Dance Number,” Play the Songs You Like’s bouncy lead single. Sometimes it’s less a question of going wrong than not quite finding the spark that makes something go right. In the same song, he adds, “I find meaning in this life when I wake up every day/But I’m feeling sick and tired in new and frightening ways.” Finally, it’s a memorable line—but what meaning he’s found, and how those ways are similar to or different from the ways we’re all feeling sick and tired, is left for another song.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/radiator-hospital-play-the-songs-you-like/,Salinas,2017.0,"When it comes to Radiator Hospital's latest album, ""Play the Songs You Like"", things get a little bit nostalgic without falling into clichés. Singer and guitarist Sam Cook-Parrott carries a distinct croon that sparkles through the 12-track album, accompanied by bassist Jon Rybicki, guitarist Cynthia Schemmer, and new drummer Jeff Bolt.

This album brings a lot to the table, starting with the history of the band itself. Radiator Hospital has been a staple in the punk and indie rock scenes since its formation in Philadelphia over ten years ago. The group has gone through various lineups over that time, but the band has always delivered music that's both heartfelt and carefully structured, with Cook-Parrott's lyrics often exploring themes of love, loss, and self-discovery.

For this particular album, Cook-Parrott spent a solid year writing and perfecting the record, inspired by classic rock and roll bands like Big Star and The Kinks. That influence is apparent, as tracks like ""Long Distance Dedication"" and ""Pastoral Radio Hit"" convey a sound that's warm and friendly, with delightful pop hooks.

As I listened to the album, the aesthetic of the songs immediately caught my attention. This album is just as much about the instrumentation and the production as it is about the songwriting. There are bits and pieces throughout the album that harken back to classic rock of the 60s and 70s, providing a unique blend of indie rock and vintage influences. Bolt's drums really take the songs to another level, providing a solid foundation for the rest of the band to flourish around.

One highlight of the album for me is the track ""Dance Number"", which has this wonderful surf rock feel that's simply exhilarating. The guitars are gritty and raw, and the bass line keeps a steady groove that's almost impossible not to tap your foot along to.

While ""Play the Songs You Like"" is a pleasant listen overall, there are moments where the album feels somewhat formulaic, lacking standout tracks that break new ground. It stays pretty much within the bounds of what is typically done in the rock genre. With several of the tracks having similar tempos and structures, it can be a struggle to differentiate which song is which.

In summary, Radiator Hospital's ""Play the Songs You Like"" is an enjoyable album that will have you humming along and tapping your foot to the beat. It's a good introduction to the band's sound and their blend of indie rock and vintage inspiration. While it may not be groundbreaking, it's a solid piece of work that will undoubtedly satisfy any fan of the rock genre. It doesn't necessarily reinvent the wheel, but it does spin it nicely enough. I give this album a 6.0 rating out of 10.","1. Review A is longer than Review B and includes more details about the band, their previous albums, and their collaborations.

Grizzly Bear,The Remixes,Rock,7.4,November 10 2005,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"It's practically a Brooklyn fairy tale: Sensitive dude makes hushed, lo-fi folk-pop in his Greenpoint bedroom after hearing just enough Iron & Wine. Dude has talented, arty friend who adds just enough arboreal, backwards-reverbed oddness to draw comparisons to the latest local avant-garde ""scene"" (other than noise, of course). The hirsute and horn-rimmed hordes rejoice; dudes reissue debut album with a disc of snazzy remixes by all their cool neighbors, plus some non-locals. Crotchety Pitchfork critic makes gratuitous opening Brooklyn references, claps hands, says ""dude"" too much. Much of Horn of Plenty's sheepish beauty lay in Christopher Bear's eccentric blurrings of Edward Droste's naturally melodic, one-microphone campfire koans. At times The Remixes sharpens the focus on Droste's songwriting, which was often submerged in Bear's abyssal touches; Safety Scissors, for instance, accelerate the syrup-sopped ""La Duchesse Anne"", add buzzing, intermittently shuffling beats, and expose a catchy ""do-do-do"" leftfield pop gem. Simon Bookish makes the most immediately satisfying turn, adding a goofy new verse about ""London Calling"" and file-sharing to a clatteringly optimistic take on the wounded ""Eavesdropping"". Still other tracks-- such as Son's fuzzy ""Shift"" or Circlesquare's coruscating expansion of the same song (whistle-choir front and center, natch)-- serve to further abstract the originals. Either way, The Remixes serves as a revelatory set of reinventions, while not a song-for-song do-over like Bloc Party's latest thingy. Listeners old and new are likely to find remixes they'll prefer over their forebears: not just Bookish's ""Eavesdropping"", but also Final Fantasy's ""Don't Ask"", which takes one of Horn of Plenty's most conventional tracks and dresses it up in strings and snug melodrama. Soft Pink Truth takes ""A Good Place"" all over the damn place-- underwater vox, ""Slave 4 U"" stripclub rhythms, meowing pet-store horn samples-- while concentrating on the song's evocative ""blow by blow"" lyric. And get me Jimmy Tamborello: Dntel does ""Merge"" as pulsing, wistful ""Chariots of Fur"" laptronica. Efterklang's opening ""Campfire"" rattles the halls of Rivendell with triumphant woodwinds that neuter the orig by comparison. Helps, too, that so many of the artists featured aren't among remixing's usual suspects. First-time second-mixers Ariel Pink offer a droning, crackly ""Disappearing Act"", like ""Our Prayer"" Brian Wilson collaborating with Syd Barrett and then vanishing like the drum fills amid reverent, one-chord acoustic strums. Castanets apparently took ""Deep Sea Diver"" literally, plunging into three minutes of groaning, rippling guitar noise-- The Life Subaquatic! As in real fairy tales, freak-folk's emperors are sometimes accused of lacking clothes; Grizzly Bear's songs beguile however they're adorned.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3667-the-remixes/,Kanine,2005.0,"If you're a fan of indie rock, you've probably heard of Grizzly Bear. This band has been around for a while, and they've made quite a name for themselves with their unique sound and powerful lyrics. Recently, they released ""The Remixes,"" an album that features a collection of their best songs remixed by some of the most talented producers in the industry. As a lover of rock music, I gave it a listen and was thoroughly impressed with what I heard.

Grizzly Bear's music has always been characterized by their use of unexpected harmonies and intricate arrangements. The original versions of the songs on this album are already so well-crafted, that I was skeptical about how remixes could improve or bring something fresh to the already great pieces. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that each remixed track had been carefully constructed, creating a new layer of dynamic sound that was unique to the producers' vision.

What I find incredible about this album is that despite the remixes being done by different artists, the tracks all still have that sound that makes Grizzly Bear unique. The producers have managed to remix the songs, leaving Grizzly Bear's signature sound intact, while still being able to add their own unique flair to each track.

I really appreciated the remix of ""Two Weeks"" by Fred Falke. He's injected an unmistakable, driving disco beat and replaced the guitar from the original, giving the track a new level of energy. ""Ready, Able,"" remixed by Allez-Allez, featured additional percussion which makes the song bolder and more immersive than the original. On the other hand, ""Foreground,"" remixed by Shields, was slower than the original version, providing a calming, ethereal ambiance which was a welcome break, while still maintaining the dark and moody vibe of the original.

In terms of the creation story behind the album, it was said to be initially born as a way to celebrate Grizzly Bear's tenth anniversary. The band wanted to celebrate their long-standing music legacy, and a remix album seemed like an excellent way to do it. The result is a collection of their classics, including fantastic remixes by a variety of talented producers. It's an excellent tribute to what Grizzly Bear has accomplished over the years.

In conclusion, ""The Remixes"" by Grizzly Bear is an incredible album, and I highly recommend it to any indie rock lover out there. The remixes of their classic tracks add a new level of freshness to their beloved sound, while still staying true to their roots as a band. While it may not be a game-changer for the already established music scene, it's an excellent addition to their discography, and the effort made in choosing a variety of remix artists really paid off.","1.

Broadcast and the Focus Group,Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age,Experimental,7.2,October 27 2009,Mike Powell,Contributor,"Broadcast and the Focus Group form a likely pair: Both groups make warped psychedelic music rooted in jazz, Euro-pop, and 1960s BBC interludes instead of rock or blues; both conjure a bookshelf's worth of cultural blasts from the nocturnal side of the world-- Satanic texts, Czech horror films, pulpy science fiction lit; both are-- as if there were any doubt after hearing their records-- acutely British. Julian House-- the man behind the Focus Group and the co-founder of Ghost Box records-- has designed Broadcast's album sleeves for years (in addition to work for Primal Scream, Stereolab, and others). The specificity of their aesthetic projects-- and yes, these are bands with ""aesthetic projects""-- is so pronounced that calling them kindred spirits implies too much accident: they're more like co-conspirators. So Witch Cults of the Radio Age is predictable-- actually, it's surprising that they didn't decide to record something like it earlier. But for all their similarities, Broadcast and the Focus Group approach their peaks in very different ways. Broadcast's music is sensual and chic; it has poise, groove, and sex; it's black eyeliner. Nitsuh Abebe, writing on this site about the band's outtakes collection The Future Crayon, pointed out that they'd become almost expert in mapping weird onto what were ostensibly pop songs. I'd agree, but almost to their discredit. Broadcast wear their idiosyncrasies like bangles-- even when I like their music, it feels like it could change shape at any time. By contrast, the Focus Group's native tongue is the stutter; the music's imbalance is in its DNA. Rarely does it ever coalesce into something intelligible, and when it does, there's usually something smeared overtop to throw it off-course. Though the album is a collaboration, it's obvious which side anchors which tracks: ""The Be Colony"", sung by Broadcast's Trish Keenan, plays like a nursery rhyme trapped in amber; ""Mr. Beard, You Chatterbox"" is 80 seconds of disjointed harpsichord and flute that flares out into static and echo. Broadcast's contributions are intoxicating and lovely; the Focus Group's sound like a three-legged kitten knocking over teacups. It's refreshing to hear two seemingly similar bands highlight each others' differences, but it's also why their collaboration isn't as impacting as the albums the bands make alone. Witch Cults is like the sound of Broadcast and the Focus Group trying to cast their spells at the same time: Some of the record is great, plenty of it is cross-chatter. ""For me, the paranormal is most powerful when it's unassuming,"" Trish from Broadcast recently told The Wire-- ""not obviously spooky or dark."" She went on to talk about how when she and Broadcast bassist James Cargill moved houses, familiar names and places took on new forms-- for example, their new downstairs neighbor looked exactly like their former roommate's girlfriend. ""Even my mom was replaced by an old toothless poodle."" It's a benign sense of horror and disorientation-- compare it, for example, to Animal Collective's professed interest in slasher movies and all the gross, visceral sounds they integrate into their songs (squish, guts, screams). Europe breeds romantic monsters like Dracula; America breeds disturbed children who grow up to disembody teenagers with mass-market appliances, like Leatherface or Michael Myers. Broadcast and the Focus Group -- together and apart-- offer something a little more prim than the image of someone getting a wooden spike through their eye, but I think the intent is roughly the same: To create a space where, for a second, there's no sense to be made.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13560-investigate-witch-cults-of-the-radio-age/,Warp,2009.0,"There are certain albums that simply command attention from the very first note, and Broadcast and the Focus Group's ""Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age"" is one of them. As soon as the introductory track, ""The Be Colony"", begins, you're immediately transported to a world that's at once familiar and exotic. The glitchy, psychedelic arrangement sets the tone for what follows on this experimental masterpiece that has earned a solid 7.2 out of 10 in the music world.

For those who aren't familiar with Broadcast, they were one of the most intriguing and cerebral acts to come out of the UK in the late '90s and early 2000s. The group's music was a blend of avant-garde experimentation with the essence of pop music, and it garnered them a cult following. Lead singer Trish Keenan's haunting vocals were consistently compelling, and the band was widely praised for their use of vintage recording techniques.

The influence of the past is certainly a major part of ""Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age"", but it's less a retro throwback than a visionary look ahead. The soundscapes here were created by The Focus Group, the studio project of Ghost Box label founder Julian House, and featuring guest appearances by James Cargill of Broadcast. Together, they push the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of experimental music, showcasing a magical musical world with a fascination for sound collage and otherworldly sonic forms.

The tracks on ""Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age"" seem less like individual songs than pieces of a larger, more immersive whole. The album ebbs and flows like a dream, with hallucinogenic intermissions that meld into one another. With titles like ""The Be Colony/Dashing Home/What On Earth Took You?"" and ""A Quiet Moment"", you're not entirely sure where you're being taken, but it's a wild, challenging ride that rewards engagement.

It is a unique album that offers the listener an opportunity to explore the unknown limits of soundscapes. It is definitely not for everybody especially those who prefer a simple, straightforward sound, but for anyone who wants to truly take an experimental music manifesto, ""Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age"" is a must-listen album that promises to take you on a deeply rewarding journey. I would highly recommend this brilliant, psychedelic and immersive album to all music aficionados who love and appreciate cutting-edge experimental music.","1.

Traxman,Da Mind of Traxman,,7.1,April 23 2012,Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,"Dance music is a futurist's game, and footwork is no different. When the music bubbled up out of Chicago's South and West Sides two years ago, listeners took notice in part because of the undeniable newness of the sound. Since then, conversation has focused on where footwork is going, especially on where forward-thinking artists both here (Sepalcure, Machinedrum) and across the Atlantic (Kuedo, Addison Groove) are taking the sound. Planet Mu releases by Chicago artists like DJ Diamond, DJ Nate, and DJ Roc ensured that the scene's progenitors got their due, but those albums-- especially Diamond's Flight Muzik-- strove for rhythmic and melodic complexity foreign to the scene's established M.O. Traxman is the latest Chicago artist to record a full-length for Planet Mu. Da Mind of Traxman is notable in part because it's an album more concerned with footwork's past than its future. A godfather of the style, Traxman came up in the 1990s ghetto-house scene and fostered the genre through collaborations, DJ sets, and mixes without building up much of a catalog under his own name. Da Mind of Traxman sounds like its title, the pent-up musings of a veteran spilling onto wax. The conversational powers of footwork shouldn't be underrated: Those whirring vocal samples are a language game waiting to happen, and the genre's unapologetic, unmonitored sampling culture allow it to interact with other musics in ways that house and techno often can't. Traxman syncs footwork to its Chicago lineage-- juke and house-- but more interestingly to soul, funk, and rock. Opening track ""Footworkin on Air"" features what sounds like a wooden xylophone competing with a pointillist sequencer and blocky bass. It's as light and frothy as footwork gets, and it has as much to do with Aphex Twin as Dance Mania. Traxman often downplays his drum machines; I get the impression he cares as much about Rhodes pianos as he does 808s. ""Itz Crack"" and ""Rock You"" contrast lilting jazz/soul melodies with quick, non-invasive percussion. On the infrequent occasions where he slips into vulgar ghetto-house mantras, he sets them against his weirdest compositions. ""Going Wild"" (a collaboration with Rashad and AG) is schizophrenic, vacillating between chirpy irritants and half-time bass distensions, all keeping uneasy pace with a wordless, Eastern vocal melody. It sounds like paint flakes off of Flying Lotus' drywall. ""1988"" pays homage to the sci-fi synth ropes of vintage Detroit techno. Of course, there's nothing particularly ""footwork"" about the Dilla-isms of ""Lady Dro"" or the tin-roof patter of ""Sound Filed"", but that hardly seems the point. When, on ""Lifeeeee Is For Ever"", he stirs Prince's organ-backed monologue from ""Let's Go Crazy"" into a stuttering frenzy, it feels less like album-closing pathos and more like a producer saying, ""oh yeah, I forgot, I really love Prince, too."" Listening to Da Mind of Traxman is a little like staring at a page of .gif images: Those short, repeating animations have a way of revealing detail. And when they don't it's still comforting to know that they'll spin there in perpetuity. Da Mind of Traxman is Traxman's musical history set on loop, a conversation held in stunted, loving bursts.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16530-the-mind-of-traxman/,Planet Mu,2012.0,"If you're a fan of experimental electronic music, then 'Da Mind of Traxman' by Traxman definitely deserves a spot in your playlist. The album is a fascinating blend of intricate beats, unique textures, and unexpected samples that constantly keep you on your toes. As an agent generating human-like reviews for music albums, I'm excited to share my thoughts on one of my favorites.

To fully appreciate 'Da Mind of Traxman,' it's important to first understand the band's history. Traxman, also known as Cornelius Ferguson, is a veteran of the Chicago footwork scene, a genre of music and dance originating from the Windy City. He's been an influential figure in the footwork movement since the 1990s, and his expertise shines through on this album. In it, he's created a unique and intricate soundscape that feels both nostalgic and fresh.

The creation story behind the album is equally intriguing. Traxman spent several years crafting the intricate beats and samples that make up 'Da Mind of Traxman'. What’s impressive is how Ferguson has crafted new sounds born out of what might well be considered cliches of the genre. Don't be fooled by the gritty, lo-fi production; each track has been meticulously pieced together, with no element feeling out of place. The result is an album that flows effortlessly from start to finish, with each track transitioning seamlessly to the next.

Let's get personal. For me, 'Da Mind of Traxman' is one of the most exciting albums of the nan genre. It's packed with intricate rhythms, playful samples, and energizing beats that never get old. The opening track 'Footworkin on Air' sets the tone perfectly, with a driving bassline and choppy vocal samples that make you want to move. 'Computer Getto' is another standout track, with a glitchy, chaotic beat that feels like the sonic equivalent of an 8-bit video game.

Overall, I'd give 'Da Mind of Traxman' a solid 7.1 out of 10. If you're a fan of experimental electronic music or just looking for something new to add to your playlist, then this album is definitely worth checking out. With its unique soundscapes and infectious beats, it's sure to keep you dancing and engaged throughout.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed than Review B.

Iggy Pop,Roadkill Rising... The Bootleg Collection 1977-2009,Rock,7.2,May 17 2011,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"For any other artist, the idea of issuing four discs of moldy live recordings-- particularly for a performer who's been anthologized a couple of times already-- would reek of the worst kind of barrel-scraping, fan-fleecing cash grab. But to summarize a career as unlikely as Iggy Pop's, it makes perfect sense. Despite the enduring import of his first three albums with the Stooges and mid-70s collaborations with David Bowie-- the influence of which can still be heard today in everyone from Fucked Up to LCD Soundsystem-- those albums tell only part of the story. The real reason why Iggy's been able to carve out a career for 40-plus years-- going from certain drug casualty to potential ""American Idol"" judge-- without the benefit of a platinum record is his magnetic charisma as a live performer. And long before YouTube allowed us to attend concerts vicariously, bootlegs played a crucial role in establishing that legend. Even without being able to see his wiry body slither across the stage, the seemingly bottomless supply of unauthorized Iggy concert recordings reified his incomparable talents for baiting a crowd, ad libbing, and rewriting ""Louie Louie"" with new lyrics more vulgar than the FBI could've ever imagined. At an Iggy show, what happens between the songs is just as entertaining and edifying as the songs themselves. This quality was first widely brought to light with the most (in)famous of Iggy-related bootlegs, Metallic K.O., a delirious document of the Raw Power-era Stooges' dying days (circa 1973-74) and Iggy at his self-destructive zenith, encouraging all manner of abuse (verbal or otherwise) from a bloodthirsty crowd. In contrast, Roadkill Rising is like the extended post-script to that moment, picking up the story in 1977, after Bowie had effectively brought Iggy back from the dead with the still-potent double-whammy of The Idiot and Lust For Life. The set devotes each of its four discs to performances from a specific decade, but even if you don't think Iggy has produced a front-to-back great album since 1979's New Values, Roadkill Rising is still worth your time. No matter what era, each disc is padded with period performances of Stooges and Bowie-era material and amusing cover-song desecrations (ranging from ""Hang on Sloopy"" to the ""Batman"" theme), while 80s/90s selections like ""Blah Blah Blah"" and ""Home"" hit with greater force when stripped of their dated productions. But more significantly, Roadkill Rising functions less as a simple overview of Iggy's post-Stooges career than an elaborate portrait of the first punk who had to grow up in public, and the difficult transition from self-mutilating spectacle into respectable artist. Early on, at a Detroit show from 1977, we hear Iggy trying mischievously to muscle his way into the classic-rock canon with a cover of Them's ""Gloria"", wherein he uses the famous refrain to spell out his own name. But later, at a particularly unruly Detroit gig from 1980-- the excerpts of which alone are worth the compilation's price tag-- we hear him paying the price for his own petulance: It takes Iggy no less than three tries to get through a subdued, smoky cover of the Sinatra standard ""One For My Baby (And One More For the Road)"", as he's forced to talk down an increasingly impatient crowd who'd rather he do away with the showtunes shtick and get back to ""Cock in My Pocket"". As Roadkill Rising traverses the 80s up through the 2000s, you can hear the audiences getting larger and more receptive to his whims, while Iggy becomes less concerned with antagonizing his audience than looking out for them; he cuts a 2003 performance of ""Dirt"" short to berate a bouncer for denying an over-eager fan's attempt to dance with him onstage. Inevitably, for a set that sprawls over four discs and 65 songs, Roadkill Rising is weighed down by blocks of inessential tracks from 1993's American Caesar and 2001's Beat Em Up, at the expense of including certified classics like ""I Got a Right"", ""Success"", ""I'm Bored"", and ""Fun House"" (the last of which is actually featured on the tracklist, but incorrectly so; it's really ""1970""). But even as it catalogs numerous changes in style, backing bands, and recording fidelity-- climaxing with selections from the Stooges' riotous 2007 reunion tour-- Roadkill Rising invariably succeeds in presenting an Iggy Pop gig as an exceedingly exciting place to be, where the line separating exhilaration and unrest is routinely blurred. And in the context of all that precedes it, the closing string of songs from Iggy's jazzy French-chanson experiment, PrÃ©liminaires-- complete with cordial, ""VH1 Storytellers""-style between-song banter-- feels less like the WTF left-turn it seemed upon release in 2009 and more like a well-deserved reprieve from spending the past four decades sating his audience's desire to see him open up and bleed.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15414-roadkill-rising-the-bootleg-collection-1977-2009/,Shout! Factory,2011.0,"Alright folks, buckle up and get ready for a wild ride because Iggy Pop's 'Roadkill Rising... The Bootleg Collection 1977-2009' is a real trip. As a long-time fan of Iggy and the Stooges, I am thrilled to have a glimpse into their raw, unfiltered live performances, spanning over three decades. The album, rated at 7.2 out of 10, is a testament to their enduring legacy as one of the greatest rock bands of all time.

Let me rewind for a moment and give you a brief history of Iggy Pop and the Stooges. Formed in 1967, the Michigan-based punk rock band quickly made a name for themselves with their raucous live performances and Iggy Pop's on-stage antics. They released their self-titled debut album in 1969, followed by two more studio albums before disbanding in 1974 due to drug addiction and personal conflicts. In the years that followed, Iggy Pop pursued a successful solo career, but the Stooges remained a cult favorite among punk rock fans.

Fast forward to 2003, when Iggy Pop reunited with the Stooges for a series of live performances and eventually recorded their fourth studio album, 'The Weirdness', in 2007. The bootleg collection, 'Roadkill Rising', chronicles the band's live performances during their original run from 1977-1978, as well as their reunion shows from 2003-2009. The album includes 16 tracks, many of which are rare or previously unreleased recordings.

Listening to this album is like being transported back in time to the late 70s, when punk rock was in its heyday. The energy and intensity of Iggy and the Stooges' live performances are palpable, and it's clear that they were a force to be reckoned with on stage. Tracks like 'I Wanna Be Your Dog' and 'Search and Destroy' are classics that still sound fresh and relevant today. The reunion tracks offer a glimpse into how the band evolved over time, with a slightly more polished sound and a renewed sense of purpose.

As someone who has seen Iggy Pop live multiple times, I can attest to his enduring charisma and showmanship. His growling vocals and frenzied dance moves are still as captivating as ever, and listening to these live recordings only confirms his status as one of the greatest frontmen in rock history.

Overall, 'Roadkill Rising... The Bootleg Collection 1977-2009' is a must-have for any Iggy Pop or punk rock fan. It's a thrilling journey through the band's history and a reminder of their enduring legacy. While the quality of the recordings may vary, the raw energy and passion of the performances is undeniable.

Tokyo Police Club,Elephant Shell,"Electronic,Rock",6.3,April 23 2008,Adam Moerder,,"After two years' worth of suspense, Tokyo Police Club's Elephant Shell carries a far heavier weight than your average debut LP. It's a letter of intent from a band that's squatted on the fence, tentative to commit to one particular genre until now. On their snappy EPs, the fresh-faced Toronto four-piece courted emo, post-punk, and pop fans with equal coquettishness, their brief, catchy songs terminating before anyone could wring them through extensive indie taxonomy. As the band's first release on Saddle Creek, no one should be surprised that Elephant Shell showcases TPC waxing bookish emo. Sure, the songs still barely scrape the two-minute mark, and you'll be hard pressed to find any long-winded solos or codas, but the band's signature assembly line efficiency has become saturated with densely layered arrangements, not to mention lead singer Dave Monks' self-consciously mature vocals. Formally shrouded in megaphone hisses and cracks, Monks practically croons in your ear, and he's brought his thesaurus with him. Already netting considerable Colin Meloy and Ben Gibbard comparisons, Monks' stately delivery isn't exactly shying away from the similarities, especially with mouthfuls like ""Dead lovers salivate/ Broken hearts tessellate tonight."" Warmed by sentiments like this, the rest of the band sounds equally gooey. Unlike the quick-cut action movie pacing of the EPs, Elephant Shell's built on fluid songwriting, each track easing into the next without giving the listener much of a jolt. While the holistic craftsmanship is commendable, lush guitar tones and intricate instrumentation doesn't do justice to the band's potential visceral kick. Just listen to the handclaps on ""The Harrowing Adventures Of..."". Recycled from TPC's stunning sci-fi ballad ""Citizens of Tomorrow"", the claps feel better suited for a golf match, lackadaisically inserted into this ho-hum sea chanty (Meloy strikes again!) as cutesy ornamentation. At times, the newfound prim and properness can feel downright suffocating. The synth line on ""Graves"" desperately wants to blast off like an M83 melody, but the song's brooding heft weighs it down. Even on a solid track like ""Juno"", with its stuttering drum intro and music hall piano punctuations, gets choked off, slumping on its anti-climactic chorus rather than shouting. Despite these setbacks, Elephant Shell stands to soak up tons of new fans and earn serious shine soundtracking TV teen dramas. That's not so much an attack on the album's marketable gravitas as it is an acknowledgment of its consistently easy-on-the-ears sound. However, with each instrument no longer fighting for attention, and Monks resting comfortably in his mid-range vocal groove, the album leaves a less-than-memorable impression. Whereas cheerleader chants and fanatic barks goaded their earlier ramshackle tracks, urging them along despite the vague sci-fi and political themes, their new incarnation conscientiously covers its bases. After dampening the powerdrill riffs on opener ""Centennial"" with his long-winded lyrics, Monks practically calls timeout towards the track's close to spell things out for us: ""I'm running out of space/ So let me sum this up for you."" The deliberation proves to be an omen. After nailing the rapid-fire EP format with tracks that constantly threatened to disintegrate themselves from the inside-out, TPC psyche themselves out on their first full-length, over-cooking songs made from otherwise spectacular ingredients.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11426-elephant-shell/,Saddle Creek,2008.0,"When thinking of some of the most influential indie bands of the 2000s, Tokyo Police Club is certainly a band that comes to mind. Hailing from Ontario, Canada, this indie rock band quickly gained popularity with their infectious and upbeat music style. Tokyo Police Club’s music has always been an interesting balance of indie rock and danceable electronic vibes, which is why their second studio album, Elephant Shell, is such an important moment in their discography.

The album opens with the fast-paced and pounding “Centennial” which sets the pace for the rest of the record. The opening track is followed by the album’s biggest hit, the catchy and upbeat “Tessellate”. The song’s repetitive chorus is something that definitely sticks in the listener's head long after the album has finished.

An interesting fact about Elephant Shell is that it was produced by Chris Walla, who is also known for his work with Death Cab for Cutie. The album was recorded in a converted barn in Ontario, Canada, which gave the album its unique production and vibe. 

As a fan of Tokyo Police Club, it's clear to me that Elephant Shell is one of the band’s most cohesive and well-executed albums. The band’s sound has never been sharper or more refined, and the incorporation of electronic elements gives the album a sound that is both old and new.

My personal favorite track is “Sixties Remake”, which showcases the band's mix of indie rock and electronic elements. In addition, “In a Cave” has a catchy and memorable chorus, while “Graves” is a moody track that really shows the more emotional side of the band.

However, not every track on the album hits the mark. “Juno” feels a bit out of place with the rest of the album and doesn’t quite match the energy level of the other tracks. “The Harrowing Adventures Of…” also seems like too much of a departure from the rest of the album, although it does feature a memorable drum beat and catchy guitar riff.

Overall, Elephant Shell is a solid album and is definitely worth listening to for any fan of indie rock or electronic music. Although it’s not Tokyo Police Club’s most groundbreaking work, it is definitely one of their most fun and accessible albums. If you’re looking for an album that feels like a mix between danceable indie rock and electro-pop, then Elephant Shell is the album for you.","1.

African Head Charge,My Life in a Hole in the Ground,Electronic,8.2,February 1 2016,Andy Beta,Contributor,"There's a telling line to be found on the back cover of African Head Charge's debut album, My Life in a Hole in the Ground: ""Another 1991 On-U Sound Creation."" That's all well and fine, except the album was made in 1981. It's a playful admission that what African Head Charge was doing to dub, post-punk, Afrobeat, industrial, and world music might make more sense 10 years down the road. It's now 35 years later and Adrian Sherwood's deconstruction of the music of Africa, Jamaica, and Great Britain might have finally found its proper decade and century. With pop stars like M.I.A. grabbing at Brazilian baile funk; dubstep practitioners like Mala and Pinch favoring tracks that sound like pulled taffy; and the spare electronic contortions of Arca, Oneohtrix Point Never, and the Fade to Mind crew, Sherwood’s tracks are more relevant than ever. Last year, his On-U Sound imprint revived itself and began reissuing a wealth of material, from a survey of Sherwood's decades of dub-punk productions to the dizzying Trevor Jackson-curated Science Fiction Dancehall Classics comp. The music could have dated from 2015, no problem. Now comes the reissuing of the first four albums of his most heady and vital project, AHC. Taking issue with (or maybe just the piss out of) Eno-Byrne's fake ethnography My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, Sherwood created a studio entity along the lines of Eno’s oft-used quote for a ""vision of a psychedelic Africa."" In much the same manner that Fela's greatest bands had Tony Allen set as the heart, AHC's pulse comes from African percussionist Bonjo Iyabinghi Noah, Sherwood’s co-conspirator throughout AHC. And titling their debut album My Life in a Hole in the Ground was no euphemism, as Berry Street Studios, the space that Sherwood utilized for his early work, was below street level. Sherwood's work in UK punk and Jamaican expat dub is crucial to understanding post-punk of that era (around this same time, he produced the Fall and many others), and he was at his finest in African Head Charge. The first album is by far the most experimental of the bunch. Take ""Elastic Dance,"" the opening track on My Life in a Hole in the Ground. A jaw harp twangs and flanges, a sinewave wheezes up and down, a skittering and skeletal drum and bass pattern emerge. And then all of it gets bandied about the stereo field by Sherwood. Always stretching his components to the breaking point and finding rubbery new spaces between these elements, Sherwood used dub techniques to explore the outer regions of punk, reggae, Indian classical, belly dancer motifs, and more. And once you're this far beyond a certain genre's gravitational pull, Sherwood realized that these disparate forms could be melted back together into fucked-up shapes. Years later, ""Far Away Chant,"" featuring the vocals of thunder-throated Prince Far I, even appeared during a violent moment in David Lynch’s Wild at Heart. The emphasis on negative space is such that when Ground standout track ""Stebeni’s Theme"" recently came on my ear buds during rush hour, the introduction of two percussionists on the train blended into that rubbery beat no problem. Environmental Studies appeared the next year and was also recorded underground, yielding a similarly claustrophobic, dank feel. More so than the first album, Studies scans as the nexus between free improvisation and dub reggae, less interested in melodic fragments and more about exploring the dark space between the two musical forms. The rotating assemblage of players included Jamaican session players like saxophonist ""Deadly"" Headley Bennett and drummer Style Scott, who was part of the riddim team that backed everyone from Gregory Isaacs to Black Uhuru, but it also made room for members of the Pop Group and Rip Rig + Panic, as well as UK free improviser Steve Beresford. ""Beriberi"" showcases a swinging horn line that’s as close to ska as the virtual group ever got while ""Crocodile Hand Luggage"" pits Bonjo’s nyabinghi drums against the sounds of running water and animal cries. By the time of Drastic Season, their third album in as many years, Sherwood, Bonjo, and cohorts had moved above ground, setting up at Southern Studios and exploring the digital hardware the studio provided. By then, Sherwood had moved beyond the dub template and began to mince the sounds into ever-smaller pieces. The croak of an actual fish becomes the central element of ""I Want Water,"" as Sherwood drowns it in all sorts of severe, whiplashing effects. Even the smallest of musical gestures, such as the short bass figures and drum taps of ""African Hedge Hog,"" get amplified until they become labyrinths. At times, the tracks scan more as experiments. Off the Beaten Track struck the perfect balance between the mad professorial experiments of Sherwood and the crack live band that had Bonjo at the helm, but it also marked the end of the group for the next five years. The dub explorations hewed closer to the rhythms now, a sound that would soon be called ""ethno-beat"" and ""tribal."" Didgeridoos and gypsy violins get turned into gnarly buzzes, African chants turn into incants, Prince Far I’s chopped declamation mixes into Bonjo’s big beat drums, and the barking dog of ""Some Bizarre"" is the most psychedelic canine until that ‘shroom-chewing coyote. Without as many heavy FX at Sherwood’s mixing desk (but an uptick of Fairlight and Synclavier noises), the grooves come to the surface. Here’s the clearest correlation from here to the early-'90s post-rock of Tortoise and HiM, the spacy throbs perpetuated by the Orb, and the illbient wooziness of WordSound’s roster. ""Language becomes an instrument of reasoning in the true sense of the word,"" goes the chorus of ""Language & Mentality,"" voiced by none other than Albert Einstein. While dealing with sounds over words, Sherwood’s work across these early African Head Charge albums nevertheless increased the vernacular of adventurous producers in the decades ahead, sounding all the more resonant in the 21st century.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21437-my-life-in-a-hole-in-the-groundenvironmental-studiesdrastic-seasonoff-the-beaten-track/,"On-U Sound,On-U Sound,On-U Sound,On-U Sound,On-U Sound,On-U Sound,On-U Sound,On-U Sound",1981.0,"As someone who has been a fan of electronic music for years, I was excited to dive into the unique sounds of African Head Charge's album, ""My Life in a Hole in the Ground"". This album boasts an impressive rating of 8.2 out of 10, and it's not hard to see why.

African Head Charge has a fascinating history that is worth exploring before diving into this album. The band was formed in the 1980s by percussionist Bonjo Iyabinghi Noah and producer Adrian Sherwood. They have always been known for their innovative use of African rhythms, mixed with reggae and dub influences.

""My Life in a Hole in the Ground"" is their second album and was first released in 1981. The process of creating this album is just as interesting as the sounds it produces. The band set up their recording equipment in an empty underground water tank, which lent the album its unique acoustics and added to the raw, gritty sound that is present throughout.

From the very first track, ""Whirlwind"", I was drawn in by the hypnotic beats and unique soundscapes. This album is a masterclass in experimental electronic music, with each track presenting a new and exciting mix of sounds and rhythms. The use of traditional African percussion instruments is a standout feature, adding a layer of complexity that is not often found in electronic music.

One of my favorite tracks is ""Free Chant (Churchical Chant Of The Iyabinghi)"", which features the haunting vocals of Noah. The combination of his vocals with the dub-style production creates a haunting soundscape that I found myself getting lost in.

Overall, ""My Life in a Hole in the Ground"" is a must-listen for anyone who loves electronic music or wants to broaden their musical horizons. The combination of African rhythms, dub influences, and experimental electronic production makes for a truly unique and captivating experience. This album is a testament to African Head Charge's innovative approach to music-making and their ability to capture the essence of a place and time through sound. I highly recommend giving it a listen.","1. Review A includes historical context and background information on the band and the album, while Review B does not.

Willie Nelson,One Hell of a Ride,Rock,8.6,April 4 2008,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Next to Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson is arguably the most anthologized artist in country music history. Even before 1975, when The Red Headed Stranger made icons of his braids and beard, Nelson had already toiled as a songwriter and performer for more than 20 years, long enough to release his first greatest hits compilation just a few years before his greatest hit. In the 30-plus years since that benchmark album, Nelson has interspersed his prolific new recordings (often two full albums a year) with a steady stream of hits repackagings. Most of his recent albums have consisted of new recordings of old material, which reinforces the impression of an artist constantly taking stock of his career, his life, and his legacy. It seems strange that with so many compilations on the market, so few of them even attempt to take in the full half-century breadth of Nelson's career. Granted, capturing such a wide-ranging, musically omnivorous artist in a limited space is always a daunting task, especially when affordability is a concern. In 1995, Willie released the 3xCD Revolutions of Time: The Journey 1975-1993, whose subtitle is revealing: Far from comprehensive, the set ignores his pre-Stranger output, including early hits like ""Shotgun Willie"", ""Crazy"", and ""Bloody Mary Morning"", in order to document his post-fame highlights. Two more recent retrospectives, the 41-track Essential Willie Nelson in 2003 and the 20-track Songs in 2005, take a wider view of Nelson's canon, but are necessarily hampered by their cursory tracklists. In Nelson's case, quantity ensures quality, which means that One Hell of a Ride is so far the best Willie retrospective by simple virtue of its size. Across 100 tracks on four CDs, the handsomely packaged set, which commemorates Nelson's 75th birthday, traces his career from his first known recording in 1954 to one of his most recent tracks in 2007. That they're both the same composition-- ""When I've Sang My Last Hillbilly Song""-- provides a nice symmetry, bookending all the hillbilly songs that came in between. One Hell of a Ride culls a full disc from Nelson's work in the 1950s, 60s, and early 70s, representing early albums like ...And Then I Wrote and Texas in My Soul, which are sadly out of print, as well as slightly more popular releases like Shotgun Willie and Phases & Stages (reissued in 2006 as The Complete Atlantic Sessions). After Willie released Stranger, the various labels he had recorded for began cleaning out the vaults, repackaging his older hits and selling them to new fans, and this set draws liberally from some of these reissues: three tracks from Willie-- Before His Time, a 1977 release of tracks from the previous decade (remixed by Waylon Jennings); one each from 1980's Minstrel Man and 1984's Don't You Ever Get Tired; and two from his All Time Greatest Hits Vol. 1. By comparison, Stranger itself gets only one track, Stardust two. This is significant. Nelson lives and dies by the song, whether he wrote it himself or is just covering it. With compositions like ""Crazy"", ""Sad Songs and Waltzes"", ""Bloody Mary Morning"", ""Too Sick to Pray"", and many others, One Hell of a Ride showcases Nelson's unparalleled songwriting skills, but with covers of compositions by Jimmy Cliff, Hoagy Carmichael, Bob Wills, Paul Simon, Fred Neil, and the Muppets, the set highlights his intuitive interpretive skills. Despite the decades in between, the leathery texture of his voice is immediately recognizable on the first disc as it is on the final disc, as idiosyncratic as Cash's grave baritone or Elvis Presley's full-bodied croon, and his behind-the-beat cadence, which draws from jazz and gospel as heavily as from country, makes every performance singular. In tandem with taking stock of his well-known hits like ""Whiskey River"", ""Night Life"", and ""Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain"", One Hell of a Ride pays particular attention to Nelson's many collaborations, the number of which suggests he might have been contractually obligated to sing with anyone who stepped within the Nashville city limits. The second disc kicks off with the first of five duets with Waylon Jennings, ""Good Hearted Woman"", from Wanted! The Outlaws, which not only helped popularize outlaw country but was for many years the best-selling country album ever. But the collaborators on One Hell of a Ride are admirably diverse: old timers like the Highwaymen (Cash, Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson) and Rays Price and Charles rub elbows with Lee Ann Womack, Leon Russell, Daniel Lanois, and even Julio Iglesias, on the gloriously cheesy ""To All the Girls I've Loved Before"". This emphasis on his friends means the third and fourth discs nearly lose Willie in the crowd, but it barely matters. One Hell of a Ride is perhaps the first Willie retrospective to portray him not simply as the famous long-haired singer-songwriter who penned hits and dodged the IRS, but as something more complex: an American artist who spent decades struggling in the country music industry, then spent decades redefining it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11366-one-hell-of-a-ride/,"Columbia,Legacy",2008.0,"When it comes to country music, there are few names that stand taller than Willie Nelson. Though he's often pigeonholed into the country genre, Nelson's sound has always been more expansive -- a little bit of folk, a little bit of blues, and yes, even some rock 'n' roll thrown in there for good measure. And that spirit of innovation is very much on display in his album ""One Hell of a Ride"", which sees him fully embracing a rockier sound.

The album kicks off with the title track, a bluesy stomp that immediately showcases Nelson's unique guitar playing style. His voice, too, is in fine form here; gravelly and weathered, but still capable of belting out a tune with conviction.

From there, the album jumps around quite a bit in terms of style, but always manages to keep things interesting. ""I Never Cared for You"" is a slow-burner with a jazzy feel, while ""Mendocino County Line"" is a rollicking duet with Lee Ann Womack that packs a serious punch.

But perhaps the standout moment of the album comes with ""Beer for My Horses"". Originally recorded with Toby Keith, this rock-tinged anthem is tailor-made for backyard barbecues and rowdy nights out. Nelson's delivery is, as always, both effortless and engaging, and the lyrics are just plain fun.

The album's creation story is an interesting one, as it was actually pieced together from various sessions spanning several decades. But you'd never know it from listening to the final product -- it has a cohesive, lived-in feel that suggests these songs were always meant to be together.

As a longtime fan of Willie Nelson, it's hard not to feel a little biased when reviewing his work. But even objectively speaking, ""One Hell of a Ride"" is a damn fine album. The rock influences may be new(ish) territory for him, but he tackles them with aplomb, and the end result is an album that feels both familiar and fresh. If you're a fan of Nelson, rock music, or just good ol' fashioned songwriting, this one's definitely worth a spin.","Step 1: Review A provides a comprehensive overview of Willie Nelson's career and achievements, including his songwriting and collaborations.

The Capitol Years,Pussyfootin',"Electronic,Rock",7.0,January 11 2004,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"So, I suppose the blurry creature being held up to the window in the photograph on this record's cover is a cat, and that the album title some sort of inane pun, but you could easily extend the title to apply to the actual music here: Pussyfootin' consists of gently rendered acoustic pop songs that decline to get up in your face, but not so light that you wouldn't notice having them around. But most clearly, the title refers to the fact that these are some of the earliest recordings made by The Capitol Years, back when it was just one guy named Shai Halperin who hadn't yet decided what he wanted to sound like; the disc compiles a bunch of songs he laid to tape way back when and ignored until finally releasing them in late 2003. The stuff he pulls from his body of 2000 and 2001 recordings offers portents of both of the directions in which his music career has taken him since then. The down-home vibe foreshadows the intimacy, if not the breadth, of his official debut, Meet Yr Acres, while the directness and umambiguously organic approach is more akin to 2002's Jewelry Store EP, the first Capitol Years album to feature a full band. There's a grab-bag of touchstones here, from obvious ones (Dylan, Parsons-era Byrds), to a few less expected ones (""There's a Bridge"" sounds like Leo Kottke backing Tom Petty). The Kottke influence becomes particularly apparent on the instrumentals ""Sloppy Train"" and ""South Jersey"", finger-pickin'-good guitar acoustic guitar workouts that help to pace the collection and make it feel more like a cohesive album. Shai obviously had more on his mind than acoustic folk when he recorded these songs, though, and subtle things, like the abundance of slapback echo on ""Those Who Suck Will Blow"" or what sounds like a flute mellotron on ""Hookers"" crop up unexpectedly to add other colors. The sound collage and vocal processing of ""There's a Starlet"" could even be called ambitious if it lasted for more than a minute. It doesn't all work, naturally, as ""Wear You Down"" sounds too worn down; the harmonies and slow, distant drums come across like The Kingsbury Manx recording after 65 continuous hours without sleep. ""Tumbleweed Prayer"", a cross-country collaboration with a songwriter named Michael Taylor, has a certain lo-fi charm to it, but it's also quite the patch job-- Taylor's vocal tape sounds like it was recorded in the foyer of a Dairy Queen on Fisher Price equipment, and it's out of time to the point where Shai's accompaniment has to drop out for a few seconds here and there and come back in when the beat is reestablished. A shame, too, because otherwise, it sounds like a pretty good song. Andy Rooney was just groaning a few minutes ago on 60 Minutes about taking stock of what's clogging up your closets each year, and deciding what to get rid of, and that seems to be what Shai is doing before moving on to the next phase of the Capitol Years. While Pussyfootin' works well as a stopgap, though, I'm more eager to see what he'll do on a full-length with his new band, which holds a lot of promise if their live show and first EP are any indication. At any rate, this exercise in cleaning house makes for an enjoyable record, and a satisfactory wrapup for this band's earliest phase.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1296-pussyfootin/,Full Frame,2003.0,"Hey there music lovers! Today, let's talk about The Capitol Years' latest album, ""Pussyfootin'""! As a fan of electronic rock music, I can confidently say that this album did not disappoint. With a rating of 7.0 out of 10, this album definitely deserves more recognition for the impressive talent and creativity that went into producing it.

First, let's talk a little bit about the band's history. The Capitol Years first hit the scene in the early 2000s with a self-titled debut album that introduced their unique blend of rock and electronic sounds. Since then, they have developed their sound, and ""Pussyfootin'"" showcases their growth as musicians. The songs in this album are a reflection of the band's musical evolution and they have taken it to the next level.

What really impressed me about this album was the story behind its creation. The members of The Capitol Years first started working on it during the pandemic, when concerts and gigs were canceled due to the lockdown. With nothing but time on their hands, they channeled all their energy into making music. The album is a testimony of their dedication to their craft.

Personally, I was thrilled when I got my hands on this album. The opening track, ""Let Me Out"", got me hooked from the get-go with its driving beat, and I couldn't wait to hear more. ""Desperate Times"" had me swaying to the beat, while ""Love Don't Come Easy"" had me singing along with the catchy chorus. The album is a perfect backdrop for a night out with friends or a long drive.

The album is a great fusion of rock and electronic music, with influences ranging from 80s synth to modern indie rock. The Capitol Years have created a unique sound that sets them apart from the crowd. The lyrics in the songs are not just mere words, but a reflection of the deep emotions and experiences of the band members.

In conclusion, ""Pussyfootin'"" is an album worth checking out. The Capitol Years have achieved a great balance of sound and composition that sets them apart from other bands in the genre. The seamlessly blended beats and melody, coupled with the raw emotions conveyed through the lyrics, make this album a great addition to any music lover's collection.

Various Artists,Blonde on Blonde Revisited,,7.6,June 8 2016,Sam Sodomsky,Associate Staff Writer,"One of the most famous Dylanisms arose from a conversation with director Sam Peckinpah on the set of the 1973 movie Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. “Just be yourself,” Peckinpah suggested to a 32-year-old Bob Dylan who, by this point, had already been everything from folk messiah to rock Judas, who had received glowing reviews and miserable ones, who once stood as a pillar of New York authenticity and was now struggling to play the role of a mysterious stranger in a Western movie filmed in Durango, Mexico. Fittingly, Dylan snapped back to Peckinpah: “Which one?” If Dylan’s 1966 double album *Blonde on Blonde *is generally viewed among his most iconic, it’s because it was his first album to show all the different Dylans in their best light, with appearances from the freewheeling folk singer from the early ‘60s all the way up to the weirdo bluesman he would later become. It’s not Dylan’s only album that plays genre and mood the way other artists use backup guitars, but it’s the one that made them all feel the most coherent, attractive, and maniacally unstoppable. For the album’s fiftieth birthday, an impressive array of acts have gathered to pay homage to its thin, wild, multiple personality disorder. Blonde on Blonde Revisited is a worthy tribute, maintaining the album's original track order and flow while also showcasing the wide-ranging talents of the artists collected. Unfortunately, things don’t start off so hot. Malcolm Middleton’s monotonous Matrix-soundtrack-meets-hotel-lobby remake of “Rainy Day Woman #12 & 35” at once drains all the brainless fun out of the original while making it sound even more brainless in the process (maybe not *everybody *must get stoned). Better is Thomas Cohen’s subtle, Britpop remake of “Most Likely You Go Your Way And I’ll Go Mine,” refitting Dylan's bluesy kiss-off with a jazzy, laid-back groove. As evidenced by last year’s fascinating Bootleg Series, however, most of the songs from this era had already been reinvented and torn apart multiple times before being released: the arrangements that Dylan landed on feel definitive for a reason. For the most part, despite the daring, experimental nature of the album proper, the songs that fare best here are also the ones that take the fewest obvious risks. Steve Gunn’s thoughtful vocal performance in “Visions of Johanna” and Michael Chapman’s intricate guitar work in “Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat” are highlights: examples of artists paying homage to Dylan’s songs not through reinvention but through total reverence. Similarly, after contributing some of the most surprising performances on last month’s Day of the Dead, Phosphorescent shows up with a refreshingly stripped back take on “I Want You,” recalling the early Oldham-isms of Pride* *more than the underwater country of Muchacho. Elsewhere, Marissa Nadler’s austere (even for her) take on “Absolutely Sweet Marie” and Ryley Walker’s stunning “4th Time Around” both make strong cases for each artist’s particular style, illustrating how influential Dylan’s music was for a generation of folk artists hellbent on sounding more like themselves. Like the best of Dylan’s work, these performance sound like timeless standards and unanswerable riddles. The real revelation here, though, is the closing number. As was the case on the original Blonde on Blonde, Jim O’Rourke’s “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” takes up the entirety of Side D (and even outlasts Dylan’s by two minutes). O’Rourke refines Dylan’s epic waltz into a gorgeous acoustic ballad– his hushed, emotive vocal recalling The Wild, The Innocent-era Springsteen in its quiet intensity. Calling back to the initial recording of the song, when Dylan’s band treated every chorus like a climax, assured that this must be the last one, O’Rourke inserts a series of found recordings of city streets, ringing phones, and passing cars between the verses. The opposite effect to the original’s eleven-minute runner’s high, these passages find the artist pausing to look out the window, overwhelmed by the task at hand and threatening to quit before coming back with more to say. It’s a fitting tribute to Dylan at a point in his career when he couldn’t even stand still for the duration of a photo shoot, when “being yourself” wasn’t an instruction to follow but an intuitive instinct. Blonde on Blonde Revisited, then, serves an album-length response to Dylan’s comeback. Why just be yourself when you can be all of yourselves, all at once?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21997-blonde-on-blonde-revisited/,Mojo,2016.0,"If you're a fan of rock music and have a soft spot for Bob Dylan's music, then ""Blonde on Blonde Revisited"" is an album that you do not want to miss.

It's no easy feat to do justice to Dylan's original music, which stands the test of time.

There's something inherently fascinating about the story of how ""Blonde on Blonde Revisited"" came to be. The album was born out of a desire to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of Dylan's original ""Blonde on Blonde"" album, a milestone that deserved to be commemorated in the most musical way possible. Scouring through the album got to experience the mix of bluesy and folky tunes, inspired lyrics and unique instrumentation, all of which added up to become a classic of rock music.

As I sat listening to this album, I couldn't shake off the feeling of awe at how talented every single contributor to the album had to be. Each band approached the music with such care and precision, ensuring that they brought a unique flavour to the tracks. A particular standout was ""I Want You,"" with an upbeat tempo and carefree spirit that made it near impossible not to dance along. 

Another standout performance on this album was Bloodshot's ""Joey"" – an exceptional melody that encapsulated the raw emotionality of the era. The peculiar arrangement of strings and electric guitar only enhanced the surrealist and exotic atmosphere.

In my opinion, ""Blonde on Blonde Revisited"" is an excellent album for both old and new-school music lovers alike. Despite not living up to the supreme standard set by the original albums and artists, it's still a mesmerizing and exciting album that pays homage to some of the best musicians of rock music's golden era.

Kayhan Kalhor & Brooklyn Rider,Silent City,,7.6,January 23 2009,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"Kayhan Kalhor is a Kurdish Iranian master of Persian music and one of the greatest living players of the kamancheh, a four-stringed, upright Persian fiddle that's tuned like a violin but has a darker tone; Brooklyn Rider is a young American string quartet in the tradition of the Kronos and Balanescu Quartets. Together, their repertoire is a mixture of classic string pieces, modern compositions, and originals composed by one of the group's violinists, Colin Jacobsen, and fleshed out by a talented bunch, equally comfortable improvising and playing complex arrangements as they are performing in concert halls and small rock clubs. Kalhor and Brooklyn Rider met as members of Yo-Yo Ma's ambitious Silk Road Ensemble, a project seeking to unite the vast range of musical traditions along the historic trade route in a way that preserves each one but casts it in the context of something broad and modern. They continue in that spirit on Silent City, finding common ground between Persian folk and modern minimalism. The album's two short pieces, ""Ascending Bird"" and ""Parvaz"", bridge those genres directly, the former by adapting a piece of folk music, and the latter by retelling the same legend with a new composition by Kalhor. ""Ascending Bird"" balances slow and deliberate phrases from the quartet, with Kalhor's warm, searching kamancheh and frenzied santur (Persian hammer dulcimer) from guest Siamak Aghaei. Percussionist Mark Suter and double bassist Jeff Beecher are also on hand to widen the aural palette. Colin Jacobsen's ""Beloved, Do Not Let Me Be Discouraged"" fuses a passage inspired by the Central-Asian Romeo & Juliet story Layla & Majnun with a 14th-century Italian song, beginning with a long, solemn meditation on the latter before swelling and finally bursting into its rhythmic second half. Engineer Jody Elff has brilliantly captured the detail and dynamic depth of the group, and this is most apparent on the half-hour centerpiece, Kalhor's magnificent composition ""Silent City"". It begins nearly inaudible, with a slow improvisation that gradually grows to a heaving, jaw-dropping climax around the 17-minute mark, only to break back down to an aching, kamancheh-led passage. Where the first climax comes with a sudden shift from dissonance to gorgeous consonance, the second is a cathartic, celebratory dance movement, with Suter returning to percussion. Silent City has something for nearly everyone-- classical music fans will appreciate the fine quality of the playing, world music aficionados will enjoy the cross-cultural currents, and it's very easy to see kids reared on post-rock and miminalist electronic music feeling at home here (if you've ever liked anything released on Kranky, you're almost certain to enjoy this). Experimentalism is always more rewarding when it leads to resounding emotional depth, and this is as good an example as you'll find of a group of musicians achieving that ideal balance.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12579-silent-city/,World Village,2008.0,"If you are a fan of the magical sounds of the Kamancheh (a bowed string instrument) or the robust and spirited style of the Western string quartet, then grab a cup of tea, sit in a comfortable chair and get ready for an unforgettable experience with Kayhan Kalhor and Brooklyn Rider’s collaborative album ‘Silent City.’ 

Kayhan Kalhor, an Iranian Kamancheh virtuoso, has collaborated with several artists over the years. His artistic vision led him to the acclaimed string quartet, Brooklyn Rider, who have made waves in the contemporary classical music scene with their innovative approaches to chamber music. The two have been collaborating since 2008, having created music that knits the sounds of the ancient Persian modes and traditions seamlessly with Western classical music. However, their latest creation, ‘Silent City’ might be their most accomplished work together so far.

‘Silent City’ is a masterpiece that transports you into a world of wonder and mystery right from the first note. The album was recorded in one session, and the chemistry between the instrumentalists is evident throughout the piece. It seems like the ensemble infuses their instruments with their breaths while playing, each note breathing life into the composition. The album is exquisitely crafted to be a single monolithic entity rather than individual tracks. The songs run into each other, creating a seamless flow that takes the listener on a journey of mind, body, and soul.

The six tracks of the album are a display of pure talent and mastery of their respective art forms. The opening track, 'Parvaz,' is a mesmerizing and soulful display of the Eastern and Western musical traditions seamlessly fusing together. Kalhor's Kamancheh takes the lead, providing the quintessential sounds of Persian music, while Brooklyn Rider’s passion-filled strings layered with catchy hooks give the track a hypnotic groove.

The album’s centerpiece and title track, 'Silent City,' is a 22-minute epic that receives minimal editing in which the compositions morph effortlessly from one passage to another. The track starts with a slow melancholic Kamancheh solo that gradually intensifies into the full ensemble summiting in strings performing rhythmic patterns that are accentuated by Kalhor's percussive Kamancheh plucking. The piece then abruptly descends into a slow and contemplative section that sounds like a meditation on what came before it. Later, leading to an upbeat climax, that still exudes introspection, to bring the track full circle. 

The final track, 'Ascending Bird,' is an arrangement of an old Iranian folk song of the same name. Starting with soft and delicate strings, the track evokes a sense of hope and longing. The melody gradually builds up, with Kalhor's Kamancheh adding a soul stirring Middle Eastern lament to the song. The strings respond, providing accompaniment to the haunting tune, creating a sound that is both eerie and alluring.

From start to finish, ‘Silent City’ takes the listener on a cinematic journey that is both magical and ruminative. The traditional sounds and compositions of Kalhor blend impeccably with Brooklyn Rider's inventive playing. The interplay between Kamancheh and strings is fantastic throughout the album, displaying an almost telepathic connection between the musicians. This album sets the bar high for future collaborations, particularly in the often-tricky genre of fusion music. Overall, the one-of-a-kind musical masterpiece earns a well-deserved 7.6 out of 10 rating, though it's nearly impossible to rate an experience that is this extraordinary truly.","1.

Gabriel Garzón-Montano,Jardín,Pop/R&B,7.4,January 20 2017,Elias Leight,Contributor,"Odds are good that you’ve heard Gabriel Garzón-Montano before, whether or not you realize it: it’s a tantalizing, slow-drip sample of his vocals underpinning Drake’s “Jungle,” which appeared on the superstar’s 2015 mixtape If You're Reading This It's Too Late. Faced with a wave of interrogation after being pressed into Drake’s service, Montano has zigzagged between gratitude—“I think it’s remarkable that the guy who’s been singing everyone’s hooks for the last five years chose me to sing a hook for him”—and an approximation of “enough already:” “I don’t want to be the guy that got sampled on ‘Jungle.’ I don’t want that to give me my value.” His poised, adamantly musical major-label debut, Jardín, should banish those concerns. Montano settles on an unusual and fertile combination of sounds, knitting together the burnished, languorous acts of the late ’60s and early ’70s—the Association, Todd Rundgren—with lean, hair-trigger grooves. The result is heavy on pearly funk and pop, live instrumentation and harmony. But Montano mostly avoids sounding like a tasteful throwback, pulling off his merger with zippy grace, in the manner of a prime Pharrell production. Like Pharrell, Montano has an everyman voice that he's adept at rescuing with exquisitely layered arrangements. But this is not immediately apparent on Jardín: early on, Montano seems intent on showcasing his lone voice in multiple settings—a slice of buzzing hip-hop soul, and then a pivot into piano balladry. The record blooms on “The Game,” the fourth track, which is filled with wonderfully multi-tracked iterations of Montano, each intoxicated on melody. Behind the lead vocal, he sings both a descending, calligraphic line and an unfussy alternative that moves with the beamed focus of a weary sigh. Just as these threaten to bottom out, he adds an onomatopoeic two-note interjection that climbs upward, like the small, immensely gratifying plop that rises after you toss a pebble into a pond. Similarly heaped vocal passages, teeming with good ideas, are everywhere on the second half of Jardín. Montano especially enjoys contrasting blocky, beeline melodies from A to B with more scenic paths, as if to gently chide ruthless, shortest-route-best-route songwriters. (Montano wrote or co-wrote every song here, played almost every lick, and served as his own producer.) ""Long Ears"" includes held notes that move with the easily identifiable logic of a staircase as well as loopy, horn-like vocal sequences, jumpy collations of lunging jabs and luxurious glides. It's like someone overlaid a men's choir doing simple warm-ups on top of the backing vocals from D’Angelo’s “Send It On.” That suggests a dangerous level of self-seriousness, but *Jardín *stays light on its feet, serving up these vocal feasts with nifty, shifting rhythmic beds: odd click-boom combinations, agitated, slap-happy pitter patter, studio-ace, Bee Gees-level punch. On “My Balloon,” Montano even designs something that could catch the ear of an adventurous radio programmer, soldering a thick synth whirl and light drum programming onto a pop-funk lattice. It’s detail-rich, but the curlicues can't hide the hook's brick-through-a-window bid for your attention. Refreshingly, there are no whiffs of Drake-indebted R&B here, none of the mixture of hard-bitten programming and bathetic singing that permeates the airwaves and continues to entrance many young singers. This divergence is not necessarily surprising—after all, “Jungle” was an outlier even within the confines of *If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late. *Montano's presence on the track helped create a resoundingly ambivalent moment on an album otherwise characterized by chest-thumping standoffishness. Still, Montano's album marks him as part of a current of rising singers pointedly and successfully ignoring the latest wave of hip-hop/R&B hodgepodge. This varied group includes Guordan Banks, who landed a No. 1 on Billboard’s Adult R&B chart in 2016, Yuna, whose album Chapters spawned a pair of radio hits, and KING, who recently earned a Grammy nomination for last year’s *We Are KING**. *Montano has been tactful about his tenuous connection with Drake in interviews, but Jardín represents a soft rebuke to the star—as well as a rich, buffed debut from an adept young artist.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22768-jardin/,Stones Throw,2017.0,"If there's one thing that Gabriel Garzón-Montano's sophomore album 'Jardín' delivers on, it's the exploration of the complex emotions that come along with romantic relationships. Released back in 2017, the album is a brilliant showcase of Garzón-Montano's growth as an artist, featuring an array of sounds that delight the senses and tell a story that can hit you on a personal level.

The Brooklyn-born singer/songwriter, who has previously worked with musicians like Drake and Lenny Kravitz, has created an album that is definitely worth exploring. For those who aren't familiar with Garzón-Montano's background, he's known for his mastery of combining elements of funk, soul, and R&B into one cohesive sound. And he certainly doesn't disappoint on this record.

To begin with, 'Jardín' is a Spanish word that translates to 'garden' in English, and it's clear that the album is a kind of flora of emotions that bloom forth from Garzón-Montano's experiences with love and loss. Unlike his debut album, which had a more organic and stripped-down sound, 'Jardín' features much more complex arrangements and production, adding layers to the tracks that make them sound more intricate and ambitious.

It's definitely not an album that you can listen to on autopilot - each song demands your attention with its own unique set of sounds and textures. For example, the lead track 'Sour Mango', features a super catchy chorus and a bubbling percussion line that isn't found in your average pop song. It's an upbeat track that portrays the excitement that comes with the beginning of a new relationship.

Meanwhile, on 'Crawl', Garzón-Montano displays an exceptional vocal range, changing the pitch of his voice throughout the course of the song to create different moods and emotions. It's a fantastic showcase of his talent and his ability to fuse different musical styles and elements into a single cohesive vision. 

The whole album is an inspiring blend of sounds that succeed in drawing you in and keeping your attention. There are a few moments that might seem a bit 'overproduced' to some listeners, but overall, it creates an immersive experience that matches the classic R&B albums of times past. 

It's difficult for me to pick a favorite song on the record, as each one has something unique that stands out. However, it would be remiss not to mention the final track 'José' as a standout song. It's a short and sweet track that features Garzón-Montano's voice soaring over a minimalistic backdrop of acoustic guitar and handclaps. It's a tender moment that closes out the album on a peaceful note.

Overall, I must say, I do highly recommend 'Jardín' to anyone looking for a truly innovative blend of pop and R&B. Gabriel Garzón-Montano's ability to meld various genres into something that feels new and refreshing is impressive. If you're in the mood for an album that takes you on a journey of emotions and musical exploration, I highly suggest giving this record a listen.","1.

Title Fight,Spring Songs EP,Rock,7.2,November 22 2013,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Title Fight are from Kingston, Penn., an erstwhile coalmining town in the northeast part of the Keystone State that uses Wilkes-Barre as its metropolitan reference point. Though its punk scene is vibrant and tight-knit, to the point of being kinda quaint, a band looking to break out on a national level needs an almost pathological level of ambition. Of course, you need great songs as well and Title Fight have plenty of those. But as a melodic punk band that functions within a realm that doesn’t have much use for typical signifiers of compositional ambition, their drive is trickier to quantify, a “most likely to succeed” kind that can smack as careerism in the wrong hands. The quartet are productive, they respect their elders (Quicksand/Rivals Schools’ Walter Schreifels produced their proper debut LP, 2011's Shed), they roll with the winners (collaborators and tourmates such as Balance & Composure and Touché Amoré), they’ve been on three different labels amenable to their sound at the time and they tour relentlessly. That and they have no time for bullshit—Title Fight’s Twitter account has over 32,000 followers and zero ""followings"", which makes them look far more focused than antisocial. So, it’s interesting to see their Spring Songs EP called “ambitious” by onlookers, as if that's a new quality for Title Fight. In a way it’s backhanded, suggesting that their previous influences such as Lifetime or Jawbreaker or Saves the Day were necessarily stepping stones to the trad indie-rock sound captured here. But it’s worth keeping in mind that Title Fight are still barely out of their teens, and you know what? That’s not an atypical listening progression for someone who’s growing up right along with Title Fight. And so Spring Songs does manifest a new kind of ambition, which is the band staking out different territory and hoping their fans come along. The arrangement makes for a tidy introduction: two songs on two sides, split equally between their two vocalists, Ned Russin and Jamie Rhoden.  Moreover, half of Spring Songs finds the vocals lunging out from the newly warm and analog production, the other have them more nestled within the handsomely textured, melodic guitar leads. The permutations allow Title Fight the ability to show just how little they needed to change their overall approach to edge into a new aesthetic. The Rhoden-led “Be A Toy” susses out the musical currency existing between early-90s Merge and mid-90s pop-punk as well as the emotional underpinning—I mean both cohorts were accused of being “slackers,"" right? And “Be A Toy” finds common ground in a line like “do you regret being used/are you used to it yet?”, trying to get your rocks off while feeling like crap. Meanwhile,  “Blush” counters with the rawer-voiced Russin raging over sour guitars for an effect that’s hooky and also jagged—it’s probably what A&Rs had in mind when trying to find that bridge between Nevermind and Dookie. In most aspects, Spring Songs is the loosest Title Fight recording. Ranging from 2:30-4:00 and removing the BPM and rhythmic strictures of punk, these would all be among the longer tracks on previous LPs Shed and Floral Green. Yet, it’s their tightest, most hook-focused songwriting yet. The spare, midtempo “Receiving Line” gives Russin’s lyrics more sonic space to be heard and as a result, a typically topical Title Fight song allows the listener more freedom of interpretation. You sense the emotional tenor when Russin sings “we drove my car that weekend/ 100 miles barely speaking,"" and with an understated economy of words, he gives just enough inside information to pique interest rather than full disclosure “‘I’m sorry for your loss’/you probably get that a lot/we didn’t have to talk/you probably get that.”  “Evolution” feels like the proper term here, as Title Fight are simply teasing out certain aspects that were present of their previous two LPs, particularly Floral Green. And if there are any qualms to be had, it’s in the sense that you’ll be hearing these again soon, that Spring Songs is a teaser rather than a standalone for a band that would probably feel very lazy if they ended 2013 without a proper release. But Spring Songs does leave a lot to the imagination and not simply in the matter of “what will the next Title Fight album sound like?” Here we have a rock band on an independent record label, whose sound and work ethic are unmistakably punk. And yet, you’re more likely to hear electro-pop or major-label bands such as Chvrches or Haim called “indie” more often than Title Fight. How is that? Is it because most of time, genre tags are used to described the perceived fanbase than the music itself? If that's the case, Title Fight really are going indie rock on Spring Songs. But even if it reaches people who aren't familiar with their past work, Spring Songs helpfully shows Title Fight as pretty much the same thing they've always been: an ambitious band that makes very good songs.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18694-title-fight-spring-songs-ep/,Revelation,2013.0,"Title Fight's Spring Songs EP is a refreshing and daring endeavor from a band that has made a name for themselves in the rock scene. With a rating of 7.2 out of 10, it's obvious that this album may not be for everyone, but for those willing to take a chance, it offers a unique and gratifying listening experience.

For those who may not be familiar with the band, let me give you a little background. Title Fight formed in 2003 in Kingston, Pennsylvania, and over the years, they developed a sound that merges punk, post-hardcore, and shoegaze. This is their fourth EP, and it delivers a fresh sound that showcases their creativity.

One of the things that I appreciated about this album is the story behind its creation. The band actually changed their intended direction for the album entirely, opting for a more laid-back, down-to-earth vibe. This decision resulted in four tracks that tell a story of a transitional period, appropriately released in spring - the season of new beginnings.

From the opening track ""Blush"" to the closing track ""Chlorine,"" the album takes you on a journey of self-reflection and growth. The second track, ""Hypnotize,"" is a particular standout, with its dreamy, almost hypnotic sound that pulls you in and envelops you in a cocoon of sound.

Personally, I enjoyed the experimentation the band showed on this album. Although some may not appreciate the more relaxed vibe, I thought it showcased the band's versatility and willingness to take risks. The EP has a sense of urgency to it, a feeling that comes from the lyrics and the raw sound of the music.

In conclusion, while Spring Songs EP may not be for everyone, it is a solid offering from Title Fight. With its blend of punk, shoegaze, and post-hardcore, the EP showcases the band's unique sound and highlights a new direction that feels both organic and necessary. If you are in the mood for some introspective rock, then this album is certainly worth a listen.","1.

The Delgados,Domestiques,Rock,6.9,April 4 2004,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"""Tempered; Not Tamed"" off The Delgados' 1997 debut album, Domestiques, begins with a French-language shoutout to Chemikal Underground Records. The band wasn't just promoting the label that their core songwriting duo, Emma Pollock and Alun Woodward, started in the early 90s; they were also giving props to the then-nascent Scottish scene, which included Chemikal signees Arab Strap, Bis, and Mogwai, and which peaked during the latter part of that decade. Of the acts on Chemikal Underground, The Delgados weren't always the most popular or critically acclaimed-- in fact, it wasn't until the turn of the current decade that they rose from the ranks with their Dave Fridmann-produced albums, The Great Eastern and Hate-- but The Delgados were always able to compete with any of the bands they signed and promoted, as handily proved by this reissue of Domestiques, which is not remastered (and doesn't need to be) but includes five bonus tracks, improved artwork, and two videos. It seems odd to compare these early songs to the band's more recent work, as they could belong to another band entirely. Despite the presence of Pollack and Woodward's familiar vocals, the approach and the sound are completely different: Instead of the well-polished cacophony of their last two albums, Domestiques has a much rawer, looser sound, almost punk in the songs' straightforward structures and simple energy. But the album contains the seeds of its successors. Woodward's acoustic meditations on ""One More Question"" and ""Smaller Mammals"" prefigure Peloton, while tracks like ""Strathcona Slung"" and ""Akumulator"" showcase the same kind of singalong, hoist-your-pint choruses the band has since perfected. Like fellow Brits like Mojave 3, The Delgados alternate male and female vocals, occasionally playing them off each other. But it wasn't always this way: Domestiques is undeniably Pollock's album. The songs that prominently feature her vocals, such as ""Big Business in Europe"" and ""Sucrose"", are by far the record's best and most dynamic. Woodward, on the other hand, shows an inclination for meandering structures and half-developed ideas, and the concentration of his songs toward the end of Domestiques makes for a disappointing anticlimax. The five bonus tracks reveal the range of sound and songwriting the band was willing to explore. ""Monica Webster"" and ""Een Telf"" are blistering, bratty punk, while ""Bear Cub"" allows Woodward to indulge his Pavement fixation. An early recording of ""Thirteen Gliding Principles"" makes an interesting contrast to the Dave Fridmann version on The Great Eastern, suggesting The Delgados were at least experimenting with sounds and time signatures as early as 1997, though it still sounds like a demo. Domestiques makes a fine point of origin for the three albums and handful of singles that followed it, but it's more than just a curio for fans: At its best, the album exposes the roots of a scene that produced one generation of bands and influenced another, and showcases a young band trying to claim its own territory in both music and business. Still, its flaws reveal they had a long road ahead of them before they'd finally arrive.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2268-domestiques/,"Chemikal Underground,Chemikal Underground",1997.0,"If you're a fan of indie rock, then you likely have heard of The Delgados. This Scottish band has been around since the early '90s, with a career spanning over a decade. Their album, ""Domestiques,"" released in 1996, is often regarded as one of their best, and it's not hard to see why.

The album kicks off with ""Under Canvas Under Wraps,"" a track that sets the tone for the rest of the album. The shimmering guitar riffs and expressive vocals are paired with lyrics that are poignant and evocative. With its hooky chorus, it's a song that immediately sticks in your head.

Throughout the album, the band's songwriting is equally impressive. ""One More Question"" is a standout track that showcases the band's talent for creating powerful melodies. The song begins with a haunting piano melody before soaring into a triumphant crescendo.

One of the things that make ""Domestiques"" so impressive is the range of emotions that the album explores. ""Sucrose And Carbonate"" is a somber track that deals with themes of loss and heartbreak, while ""Repeat Failure"" is an upbeat toe-tapper that celebrates perseverance and optimism.

But it's not just the songwriting and lyrics that make this album so captivating- the musicianship is also top-notch. The band's unique sound is a blend of fuzzy guitar riffs, soaring harmonies, and driving rhythms. The result is a sound that's both nostalgic and fresh, with a nod to '90s alternative rock while also sounding ahead of its time.

As someone who has listened to this album on repeat, I can confidently say that it's a must-hear for anyone who loves intelligent, thought-provoking music. It's an album that rewards multiple listens, revealing new layers of depth and meaning with each spin.

Blank Dogs,Under and Under,"Experimental,Rock",8.1,July 1 2009,Roque Strew,,"Blank Dogs make the familiar unfamiliar. For instance, we have seen these elaborate PR tactics before: one man posing, at least in name, as a band, but with studiously guarded anonymity. But the web unearthed a name and pieced together a back-story, and Mike Sniper has been outed as the mastermind behind the project. A walking Wikipedia of music arcana, he played guitar in the New Jersey punk outfit D.C. Snipers, hawks rarities at the Academy Annex record shop in Williamsburg, hand-crafts gig posters and t-shirts, and set up both the power-pop-reissue label Radio Heartbeat and, more recently, the Captured Tracks imprint. His art has colonized every corner of his life. For anyone tempted to paint Sniper as a bandwagon-jumper, chasing some kind of hipper-than-thou low fidelity trend, one glance at this CV would straighten them out. Mysterious, minimalist, alive to antecedents, Sniper's way of advertising himself mirrors his way of expressing himself. Again, there's a faint illusion of laziness. But it's the appearance of a narrow palette and recycled template-- the jog tempo, meekly mechanized drums, tin and treble, voices a room or two down the hallway-- that hides a more complicated reality. As Sniper himself told The Fader: ""I have these visions sometimes of writing songs that sound like Jeff Lynne or the Move, but it still comes out sounding like some blown out Factory Records demo."" But Under and Under dispatches the charge of repetition and ""samey"" songcraft very quickly. Track two, ""L Machine"", flies far off course, continents away from Robert Smith's private property, to land somewhere in Cabaret Voltaire's jungled, more treacherous terrain. While the simplicity of the album opener is preserved-- the guitar's three notes are taken over by the keyboard-- a crude, anxious vision of the future emerges. Howls of electronic static, hissing and beeping like signals intercepted by satellites, vie not only with a spirited acoustic strum, but explosions of broken glass. The startling blend suggests a close encounter of the third kind, followed by a sloshed bonfire. Another brilliant departure comes late in the record, in the aptly named ""Slowing Down"": the song decelerates from Under and Under's usual cruising speed, without sacrificing the project's love of disorder. Even at slower tempos, he pairs echoing guitars with slashing sounds and a chaotic hook, perhaps a decayed ode to decayed love. Weighed against the well-received On Two Sides, released by Troubleman Limited, Blank Dogs' second full-length is more colorfully composed, without straying too far from Brooklyn's increasingly popular ragged-reverb aesthetic. Admirers of Crystal Stilts and Vivian Girls, in particular, will already have a soft spot for Sniper's particular flavor of pop deconstruction. (As of 2008, you can even call them labelmates: the recent Blank Dogs EP The Fields was released by Jeremy Earl's Woodsist Records.) Where Vivian Girls sand their sharp, discordant edges with harmonies, and where Crystal Stilts shower rain over sun-kissed 1960s pop, Sniper veers off in a different direction. There's a temptation to slander these family resemblances as hipster herd thinking; given the obvious sense of community across labels like In the Red, HoZac, Art Fag, of like-spirited musicians collaborating and ideas cross-pollinating, the truth is brighter. The emotions, of course, are darker. In Under and Under, especially, today connects to yesterday through Sniper's abiding love for the overcast moods of post-punk and the gloomier regions of new wave. The struggle to squeeze Blank Dogs into a genre is important to his project-- maybe not to the artist, but certainly to the listener: meaning can be found in each hint of music history, real or imagined. Post-punk's memorial to blighted industry is fittingly evoked here. The Blank Dogs aesthetic, and that of the larger low-fi movement, gracefully soundtracks our moment, as a kind of comment on technology's rising tide capsizing all boats. ""Setting Fire to Your House"" captures the present malaise, expertly pitched between menace and innocence. Like Sniper's earlier ""Leaving the Light On"", the song sinks a charismatic chorus into an enveloping melancholy. It is worth comparing his treated voice to a more famous manipulator. About T-Pain's reliance on Auto-Tune, The New Yorker's Sasha Frere-Jones noted: ""His vocal hooks sound delirious, not desperate."" By shrouding or drowning-- the goth atmosphere demands morbid verbs-- his voice in reverb and distortion, Sniper aligns himself firmly on the side of desperation. The giddy delirium, on the other hand, is the province of the keyboards, which have the whiny timbre of a children's toy, or a campy Theremin, in the moan and sigh of solitary notes. Chords would have been too delightfully unified to capture recession-era fragment and isolation. New wave, which came to describe the groomed and well-behaved child of punk, is no less relevant: Sniper makes use of the style's bittersweet melodies, but muddies them to oblivion, pulling them back closer to the raw emotional punch of punk. The patina of fuzz brings to mind garage rock and gauzy shoegaze (or is that fuzz really Psychedelic Fur?), while others spot goth, all suggesting amped-up arrangements of manic-depressive lyrics. Sure enough, Sniper captures the translucent train-through-fog chug of the Jesus and Mary Chain (""The New Things""), the garbled gloom of Red Lorry Yellow Lorry (""Open Shut""), and the space-age detachment of Soft Cell's Mutant Moments EP. But how can one man call to mind so many styles without sinking into incoherence? The key lies in the tunes' blurry shapelessness, the sense that we're apprehending something through squinted eyes or a Vaseline-splotched lens, and that a kind of Rorschach-blot logic of projecting and imagining takes over. Just don't ask what that something is.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13040-under-and-under-the-fields-ep/,"In the Red,Woodsist",2009.0,"Under and Under by Blank Dogs - An Experimental Rock Masterpiece

I have been a fan of the Blank Dogs for years, and they have never ceased to amaze me with their musical talent and creativity. With the release of their latest album, Under and Under, they have managed to elevate their experimental rock sound to new heights. The album is a melange of eerie, psychedelic sounds combined with driving guitar riffs and haunting vocals that leave a lasting impression.

If you're not familiar with the Blank Dogs, you should know that they are a notoriously enigmatic band. Lead by the enigmatic musician Mike Sniper, the band released a string of underground albums before gaining wider recognition for their unique take on experimental rock. Sniper is a true mastermind, and his brilliant songwriting and musical arrangements are on full display on Under and Under.

The album's creation story is one of equal intrigue. Sniper went through a period of intense personal turmoil while creating the album, which adds an extra layer of emotional depth to the already haunting music. The result is a collection of tracks that are simultaneously brooding and beautiful, a reflection of the dark and light parts of life.

As for my personal experience and opinions of Under and Under, I must say that I was blown away right from the first listen. The album has a sweeping, cinematic quality that transports you to another world. It's an album that you can get lost in for hours, and each listen reveals new layers of complexity and nuance.

From the driving guitars and jangly percussion of ""Tin Birds"" to the melancholy beauty of ""Just Wait"", every track on the album is a standout in its own way. The instrumentation is superb, with everything from synthesizers to horns to distorted guitar riffs blended together seamlessly.

I particularly loved the haunting vocals on tracks like ""Ages Ago"" and ""Out the Door"", which convey a sense of longing and melancholy that is truly affecting. The album's standout track, in my opinion, is ""The Jig Is Up"", a sprawling, epic song that builds to a hypnotic climax of distorted guitars and soaring vocals.

In conclusion, Under and Under by Blank Dogs is an experimental rock masterpiece that is not to be missed. It is a testament to the band's extraordinary creativity, and offers up an exhilarating listening experience that will stay with you long after the album has ended. I give it a solid 8.1 out of 10 rating and I recommend it to anyone that loves experimental music.","1.

Pentangle,The Time Has Come: 1967-73,Rock,8.5,March 30 2007,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"Along with the Incredible String Band and Fairport Convention, Pentangle was one of the major pioneering forces to first put British folk-rock on the map in the 1960s, and their distinctive hybrid of folk, blues, and jazz has-- for better and sometimes worse-- subsequently inspired countless musicians to follow their progressive trail. Despite their legion of disciples, however, their true influence has always been tempered by the fact that few groups could hope to duplicate Pentangle's unique chemistry or sheer instrumental prowess, attributes which are in lavish display on the mammoth 4xCD retrospective The Time Has Come: 1967-73. Pentangle's music has been frequently anthologized over the years, including-- confusingly enough-- on two separate compilations entitled Light Flight. And while it can't be said to be entirely comprehensive, The Time Has Come does provide a balanced portrait of the freewheeling group's six-year career. Extensively illustrated and annotated, the collection features excerpts from each of their studio albums, re-mastered singles and B-sides, as well as the requisite passel of previously unreleased live tracks and rarities. Containing nearly five hours of music and packed with a variety of astonishing curios, the set ultimately manages to feel rather definitive, and does well to capture Pentangle in all their brilliance, self-indulgent excess, and period splendor. By the time Pentangle formed in 1967, guitarists Bert Jansch and John Renbourn were already well-established talents on the English folk scene. The two had previously issued an album together as a duo, utilizing what became known as a ""folk baroque"" fingerpicking style that drew heavily upon the influence of innovative British folk guitarist Davy Graham. Joining them to round out Pentangle was vocalist Jacqui McShee, who was also an experienced performer on the folk circuit, and the veteran jazz rhythm section of double bass player Danny Thompson and drummer Terry Cox. Once so assembled, Pentangle's core quintet were capable of an extraordinary versatility, and quickly proved themselves equally adept at covering 17th century English folk ballads, Charles Mingus' ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"", or the Jaynetts girl-group classic ""Sally Go Round the Roses"". Moreover, Pentangle's ability to transverse musical boundaries soon became so seamless and organic as to be almost invisible, as when Renbourn delicately weaves an exotic sitar line through the group's version of the traditional English ballad ""Cruel Sister"". And though many of their bold stylistic moves have since been rendered into coffeehouse clichÃ© by lesser talents, there are still many moments of dazzling invention and surprise to be discovered all across The Time Has Come. The collection's first two discs are assembled chronologically, interspersing album tracks with various outtakes, BBC sessions, and non-album rarities. This arrangement surely caused the set's curators to make some tough calls and quirky decisions, such as leaving off the studio versions of many of Pentangle's better known songs (""Let No Man Steal Your Thyme"", ""Sally Free and Easy"") and drastically editing down their 1970 side-long epic ""Jack Orion."" Nevertheless these two discs do an admirable job illustrating the gradual evolution of Pentangle's remarkable chemistry. On early tracks ""Waltz"" and ""Travelling Song""-- both recorded at the time of Pentangle's 1968 debut album-- the group sound tentative, feeling its way around incorporating its diverse sonic elements. By the time of such 1969's Basket of Light and 1970's Cruel Sister, however, Pentangle were operating as an incomparable whole, with McShee's frequently sublime vocals perfectly complemented by Jansch and Renbourn's atmospheric guitar work. The group's easy compatibility is particularly evident on the set's live material, such as on a version of Basket of Light's ""Hunting Song"" which was recorded at BBC for John Peel's Top Gear. Longtime Pentangle fans will likely have something of a mixed reaction to The Time Has Come's third disc, which consists of a live concert recorded at Royal Festival Hall in June, 1968. Twelve of the concert's songs were originally released on 1968's Sweet Child double album, and seven others were included on a 2001 re-master of the album. Here the tracks have been re-sequenced and cleaned up, with much of the between-song banter and applause removed. Though this remains a solid performance, this set might feel a tad redundant to anyone already familiar with Sweet Child, and more impatient listeners might find themselves wishing the producers had also seen fit to edit out a bass solo or two. The Time Has Come reserves its real treasure trove for last, as the final disc is entirely filled with previously unreleased material, most of which is of an uncommonly high caliber. Several of these unearthed tracks were recorded live for various TV broadcasts between 1970-72, and find the group at their most dynamic and expansive. In fact, on some of these performances, Pentangle begin to almost resemble an British response to the Grateful Dead, an impression that is further amplified by their live version of the longtime Dead staple ""Cold Rain and Snow"". This comparison is likely most valid on the live, 19-minute interpretation of the group's signature ""Pentangling"", whose electric figures and wayfaring improvisations can sound much more in line with the Avalon Ballroom than the English countryside. Most curious of all is the set's inclusion of not one but two title works from film soundtracks, ""Tam Lin"" and ""Christian the Lion"", that were digitally pieced together from individual verses used as in the films as a narrative device. Needless to say, the practice of using ethereal folk songs as a cinematic framing device is one that has sadly gone out of fashion, and the presence of these offbeat tracks reinforces the impression of Pentangle as a group who were wholly and intrinsically of their time. And though echoes of the group's artistic legacy still resonate in Jansch's current solo work, and in the music of such younger artists as Espers, Devendra Banhart, and Vetiver, The Time Has Come should stand as further evidence that we'll not soon see Pentangle's like again.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10041-the-time-has-come-1967-73/,"Sanctuary,Castle",2007.0,"When it comes to the world of rock music, there are certain bands and albums that are considered to be influential and innovative. Pentangle is one such band that remains legendary to this day. Their album 'The Time Has Come: 1967-73' is a masterful collection of their best work that showcases the band's remarkable musical abilities and range.

To give you a brief history of the band, Pentangle emerged in the late 1960s during the folk-rock wave and was known for blending traditional British folk music with rock and jazz elements. They consisted of five incredibly talented musicians named Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, Jacqui McShee, Danny Thompson, and Terry Cox, who all contributed to the group's unique sound.

'The Time Has Come' is a compilation album that features songs from the band's first six albums, spanning from 1967 to 1973. One of the most interesting aspects of this album is how it demonstrates the evolution of the band's sound over the years. From the beautifully harmonized, traditional folk ballad 'Light Flight' to the jazz-infused 'Hunting Song,' there is no shortage of variety in the musical styles and genres Pentangle was able to venture into.

One standout track is 'Cruel Sister,' which features stunning and haunting guitar work by Jansch and Renbourn, giving the song an eerie medieval feel. The harmonies provided by McShee's delicate yet powerful voice and the vocal harmonies add to the overall mystique of the track. It is a song that you could listen to again and again, and still find something new to admire.

Personal opinion plays a role here too, and as someone who has been a longtime fan of Pentangle, I believe 'The Time Has Come' is a magnificent album that showcases all of the best elements of the band's music. There is something about their blend of folk, rock, and jazz that is timeless and still sounds fresh even after all these years. 

Overall, 'The Time Has Come: 1967-73' is an outstanding compilation album that is worth listening to. Whether you're a fan of traditional British folk music or just a lover of good music, Pentangle's musical abilities and range is sure to delight and impress. It is an album that deserves a place in any serious music fan's collection. I would give it a rating of 8.5 out of 10.","1.

Joy Zipper,The Heartlight Set,"Experimental,Rock",6.7,June 23 2005,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"""Heartlight,"" whatever that may be, has lent its name to a personal favorite young adult science-fantasy novel by T.A. Barron, a Marion Zimmer Bradley witch-story paperback I came across three minutes ago on Amazon, and of course, the rousing Diamond/Bacharach pop song. It makes sense that Joy Zipper would adopt the phrase, given their obvious debt to My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, the phosphorescent pink glow of which come closest to sonically approximating its compelling image. On The Heartlight Set, Long Island duo Vinny Cafiso and Tabitha Tindale continue to let that oneironautic influence shine in a greasy rainbow alongside Stereolab and the omnipresent Pet Sounds. At the outset, Joy Zipper's latest looks to augur a slight shift. First track ""Go Tell the World"" all but sends up the band's frequent White Stripes comparisons (y'know, 'cause they're a couple) with Tindale's talky, blues-based vocals calling out over a swinging drum beat. Shortly, though, the typical swirly Shields-isms snuff the budding retro-rock in familiar shoegaze-era production values. The Belle & Sebastian pop of ""Anything You Sent"" is another exception, veering dangerously close at the chorus to the ""come on, come on and dance all night"" section of Lovin' Spoonful's ""Summer in the City"". By the record's end, songs like horn-lightened ""World Doesn't Care"", catchy yet endlessly repetitive ""Rockdove"", and diaphanous, immersive finale ""Holy Driver"" return to the band's status quo. In their sonic appropriations, Joy Zipper most resemble Snow Patrol's polished Final Straw. Indeed, first single ""You're So Good"" has Tindale and Cafiso both sounding notably Lightbody-esque over simple, crunching guitars, and the lyrics share Lightbody's intra-relationship emotional space without his string-yanking specificity. Forthcoming single ""1"" is a catchy gray spot, laying Cafiso's unspectacular love poetry (""you're the one"") atop one of the recycled chord progressions that allowed 90s alt-rock radio to exist. A fizzy guitar lead during instrumental bits jumps straight out of the solo in Weezer's ""Across the Sea"", but the words are more Green Album. My childhood Heartlight involved vast galactic struggles worthy of L'Engle, if not Lucas or, humph, Dubya. Joy Zipper's meticulous dream-pop is, similarly, in the realm of the tesseract-enabling science fantasy, but its emotional palette ranges mostly between kinda-melancholy (""Thoughts a Waste of Time"") and sorta-happy (""What You Want""-esque ""Window""). OK, there's also the incongruously tawdry ""For Lenny's Own Pleasure"" (that's Bruce, natch). No Diamond, though.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4304-the-heartlight-set/,Mercury,2005.0,"The Heartlight Set by Joy Zipper is a captivating album that showcases the band's experimental rock skills. With a rating of 6.7 out of 10, it's clear that this album is not without its flaws - but that doesn't stop it from being a must-listen. 

Firstly, let's take a moment to talk about Joy Zipper's history. This musical duo hails from Long Island, New York, and has been active since the late 90s. Their sound is eclectic, mixing different genres of rock with experimental elements that set them apart from other bands. The Heartlight Set is their fourth studio album, and it marks an important point in their career - it shows that Joy Zipper is still true to their unique sound and style, despite the glut of imitators that have emerged in recent years.

The album was written and recorded during a difficult time for the band. The duo had just lost their shared studio, and they were dealing with the stress of relocating and building a new creative space from scratch. This turbulence is evident in the music itself, which is at times frenetic and unpredictable - but that's part of what makes The Heartlight Set so engrossing. Each track feels like a cathartic release, with emotionally charged lyrics and instrumentals that are both jarring and beautiful.

My personal favourite track on the album is ""Held"". From the first few seconds, it's clear that this is a different kind of song - the opening notes are stripped down and vulnerable, with lead singer Tabitha Tindale's voice taking center stage. As the song progresses, the instrumentation becomes more complex, but it never loses that initial sense of intimacy. I find that this song speaks directly to the listener, like a personal message from Joy Zipper themselves.

Overall, The Heartlight Set is an album that demands attention. It's not for everyone - if you're looking for something easy to listen to, this may not be the album for you. However, if you're a fan of experimental rock and appreciate the effort that goes into creating something truly unique, then The Heartlight Set should be on your playlist. Joy Zipper has delivered another engaging piece of work that reminds us of their creative prowess - and I, for one, am excited to see what they come up with next.","1.

Animal Collective,Feels,Experimental,9.0,October 17 2005,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"With each new album it becomes clearer that Animal Collective will not stay still. You can see them on tour and get a preview of the album to come in their live show, but aside from that, it's difficult to tell which direction their music will go next. If you'd heard Spirit They're Gone or Danse Manatee you could possibly have predicted the more difficult and abstract direction of Here Comes the Indian but you wouldn't have guessed they'd make something like Campfire Songs around the same time; if you'd heard the latter you'd might hazard a guess about Sung Tongs but Feels wouldn't necessarily strike you as the work of the same band. That said, the newly released Feels is not a total departure from Sung Tongs, and it actually tracks it quite closely in terms of the album's structure. It's apparent from the first few bars of ""Did You See the Words"" that A.C. begins in ""song"" mode, setting aside for the moment the soundscaping that defined the earlier records. The first spin is a tad disconcerting because, with its electric guitar and more trad band set-up, Animal Collective sound for the first time like what they've always been to detractors with more outrÃ© tastes: an indie rock band. The songs proceed with a logic that has more to do with the early experiments of Mercury Rev than say, Sebadoh, but where Animal Collective previously sounded as if they were working according to an unusual set of rules, the first half of Feels exists in relationship to music history, and not just any music history, but rock. I hear the ghosts of 1950s artists like Buddy Holly inside more straightforward pop songs ""Grass"" and ""The Purple Bottle"". On ""Grass"", the reverb on Avey Tare's voice adds a hiccup to every syllable and the guitar is processed to sound at times like the rollicking boogie-woogie piano rhythm. Of course, 50 years ago no one would have made a chorus out of loud, clipped screams synchronized to bashed drums (well, maybe Jerry Lee Lewis), and the conversational vocal harmony breakdown of ""The Purple Bottle"" jumps ahead a decade to a highly psychedelicized Beach Boys. Such moments are why the adolescent unpredictability of Animal Collective is such an asset-- they're able to tap into the narrative of Western pop while making it their own. Like Animal Collective's previous full length, Feels is sequenced carefully, with jauntier, tuneful numbers leading to an amorphous back half. The two transitional songs in the record's middle, ""Bees"" and ""Banshee Beat"", are among the best things Animal Collective has done. ""Bees"" imagines how a drifting pop song might sound inside the sonic universe of an Alice Coltrane album, with a trebly autoharp that is all strings and no body and sustained clusters of piano that bring to mind an ascension through clouds. ""Banshee Beat"" is even better. Animal Collective's signature approach to composition-- in which open chords are strummed repeatedly for longer than seems necessary to create a unique sense of tension relieved only by vocal chants and howls-- finds its apotheosis over these eight minutes. ""Daffy Duck"" is a further exploration of the ideas presented on ""Bees"", and ""Loch Raven"" is an uncharacteristically tender electro-acoustic lullaby, vaguely Aphexian in the way it mixes sine wave drones with a simple piano line and a cluster of wordless voices. The upbeat ""Turn Into Something"" brings the album back to where it started. Feels is an excellent record, one that, despite a more conventional approach, happens to get better over time. But it's also interesting to contemplate as a chapter in the Animal Collective story. If the childhood pals can stay friends and continue to inspire each other we may have some more great records down the road. At the moment they seem on a pretty heady plateau, but you don't get the idea listening to Feels that they've said nearly all they have to say. ",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/193-feels/,Fat Cat,2005.0,"If you're looking for something outside of the typical music experience, an experimental sound that immerses you in its own universe, then look no further than Animal Collective's ""Feels."" This album, with its intricate layers and unexpected sonic pockets, creates an otherworldly experience that is both rousing and introspective.

Animal Collective is a band that has been creating innovative music since 2000, and they have been on the forefront of the experimental music scene ever since. Their sound is constantly changing and evolving, but it always carries a sense of an almost spiritual connection with nature and the world around us.

In ""Feels,"" Animal Collective continues this exploration of our connection with the natural world, as well as our own internal struggles and emotions. The album was created in a cabin in the woods of Arkansas, and this seclusion and contact with nature can be heard all throughout the album. The music feels like a human experience trapped within the confines of a natural landscape, constantly changing and growing as it explores the natural world around it.

The opening track, ""Did You See the Words,"" is a perfect example of this exploration. The sound starts with tribal drumbeats and quickly amps up, creating a sense of being pulled along a river. The lyrics, ""I know I'm made of mistakes, tell me what do you see?"" carry an almost spiritual depth, asking the listener to question and examine themselves.

""Grass,"" the third track, is a personal favorite of mine. The soundscape is built around a single repeated guitar riff, surrounded by layered textures and cosmic effects. The echoing vocals are blended so perfectly it creates an almost choral sound, adding a layer of unease that really encapsulates the lyrics: ""I'd like to know, where you got the notion/ said I'd like to know, where you got the notion, to rock the boat.""

Overall, ""Feels"" is a magnificent album that showcases Animal Collective's innovative and ever-changing sound. The album is both rebellious and tranquil, a perfect example of a band at their creative peak. For experimental music fans or just fans of good music in general, this album is a must-listen. With a rating of 9.0 out of 10, ""Feels"" is an immersive and stimulating auditory experience that can take you on a deep journey of self-discovery.","Review A is the human written review.

Jimmy Eat World,Integrity Blues,Rock,7.3,October 22 2016,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Jim Adkins had written himself off. Judging from the open letter announcing *Integrity Blues, *the Jimmy Eat World frontman had spent the band’s first-ever hiatus soul-searching. For 15 years, Jimmy Eat World had been judged against their self-help smash hit “The Middle,” and this past April, Taylor Swift gave it a signal boost with an uncomfortably mixed message: “I used to listen to this in middle school!”  The expansive, emotionally weathered *Integrity Blues *sounds nothing like “The Middle,” but it’s perhaps their best record since then on account of being its unlikely spiritual sequel. It does feel odd praising Adkins for taking the initiative to actually write about himself, given Jimmy Eat World’s status to many as emo’s quintessential band. But unlike the other songwriters responsible for breaking emo onto alt-rock radio in early ’00s, Adkins never created a persona that made him inextricable from his music, allowing the audience rather than the author to inhabit the role of the narrator—this is why *Clarity *and *Bleed American *have aged much better than unearthed LiveJournals like *The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most *or *Deja Entendu**. *But after Bleed American redeemed Jimmy Eat World commercially, their albums have been increasingly self-conscious and reactionary: the blue-black millennial malaise of *Futures *led to the peacocking radio-rock of *Chase This Light; *the band reunited with *Clarity *and *Bleed American *producer/donut innovator Mark Trombino for Invented, an ambitious and uneven collection of character sketches inspired by Cindy Sherman and Hannah Starkey photography. It led to another precipitous drop in sales and was followed by the streamlined *Damage, *pitched as an “adult breakup record,” but sounding complacent and AOR enough to soundtrack a date night movie at AMC Cinema. Their new partnership with Justin Meldal-Johnsen on *Integrity Blues *is both sensible and inspired: he’s worked on recent records for Paramore and Tegan and Sara, acts with emo foundations who are unrepentantly making rewarding *pop *now and Jimmy Eat World is as much a pop act as Carly Rae Jepsen is emo. Meldal-Johnsen is perhaps best known as the producer and bassist for M83—a band that sounds little like Jimmy Eat World, but still uses “can you still feel the butterflies” as an operating artistic principle, creating fantastical safe spaces in which teenage melodrama is a life-sustaining renewable resource rather than an escape. At least from a production standpoint, *Integrity Blues *is the exact opposite of what the title promises: it’s a complete fabrication of a four-person rock band, a proudly produced record where barely anything sounds like it does in its natural state. The guitar that opens “You With Me” is almost comically opulent, like a harp strung with liquid crystal and wrapped in icicle lights. Falsetto harmonies channel an ultralight beam through stained glass, sounding closer to the synth-prog hosannahs of Mew or Passion Pit. Every element of Zach Lind’s drum set is tweaked with crackling EQ and Rick Burch’s bass is a pulsating synth bubble. And yet the modesty that would often dulled and sanitized *Chase This Light *and *Damage *provides necessary heft on *Integrity Blues. “*You With Me” still feels like four guys in a room. Integrity Blues is in the exquisite, crystalline mold of “Polaris” or “Ten” and they’ve never successfully spent the majority of any album in this mode until now. The rumbling exposition of “Sure and Certain” and its choral liftoff nods back at professed superfans Chvrches, “It Matters” is unusually slinky and guitar-free, “Pretty Grids” is damn near translucent. Elsewhere, they prove deft and evoking their past glory without rehashing it: actual adult breakup ballad “The End Is Beautiful” is a crossbreed of “Hear You Me” and“Cautioners,” and Jimmy Eat World can still write spring-loaded, major-third melodies (“Through”) and add to their flawless run of 6+-minute epics (closer “Pol Roger” is “23”going on 40). The deceptively worded “You With Me” (“what makes our love so hard to be/is it you or is that you with me?”) is also indicative of Adkins’ subtle and progressive growth as a lyricist. Freed from the narrative strictures that *Damage *and *Invented *couldn’t support, *Integrity Blues *unpacks an adulthood spent “destination addicted,” whether the arrival is financial, romantic or even emotional success. At times, it’s almost like he’s ripping up the lyric sheets of his past—20 years after “Episode IV” promised a chance to dance all night, Adkins sneers, “But that’s something we never do...there’s my dream, doesn’t that sound good to you?” “Our weakness is the same, we need poison sometimes,” went the refrain on *Clarity’s *intoxicating “Ten”; Integrity Blues' frostbitten title track declares, “no one’s making you spend lonely nights poisoned through and through.” Even in his less resolute days, Adkins was always a try-hard type, and and his new bootstraps mentality can aggravate that impulse: the thematically impenetrable “Pass the Baby” creeps from a monotone, no-fi electronic lurch to math-rock pummeling, a reminder that Adkins once branded himself a Jesus Lizard ripoff artist and proof that menace and obscurity are the opposite of what they’re good at. Lead single “Get Right” serves as *Integrity Blues’ *thesis (“disguised as patience, time gets wasted”), but it's probably the least compelling Jimmy Eat World single ever released. It’s immediately followed by one of their best; “You Are Free” is earnest and comforting, on the edge of cloying, and unabashedly anthemic—like all of Jimmy Eat World’s best songs, it tells you what you need to hear right when you’re vulnerable enough to hear it. “Amazing the emotional bridges, tunnels, roads and ways we go around what’s one step from our face,” Adkins sings. “You Are Free” echoes the sentiments of “The Middle,” but not its belief that “everything will be alright”—it can be, if you’re willing to accept your responsibility. Though Jimmy Eat World hasn’t had much part in the ongoing renaissance of emo—in fact, some of it may be a *reaction *to what *Bleed American *hath wrought—*Integrity Blues *finds itself sharing its dominant concern of using the genre’s inherent vulnerability and introspection to promote self-esteem rather than self-pity. Summarizing his view of integrity, Adkins sings, “It’s all what you do when no one cares,” on the title track, written during a brief solo tour where he played to small crowds in bars and churches in places like Billings, MT and Maquoketa, IA. It’s indicative of Integrity Blues’ diamond-cut polish that this is the rawest thing here—while Adkins is backed by tearful Sigur Rós strings, his vocals are completely unadorned, possibly even first-take. It just took some time, but we’re finally hearing what Adkins has to say for himself.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22378-integrity-blues/,RCA,2016.0,"If you're a fan of alternative rock, then there's a good chance you've heard of Jimmy Eat World. The Arizona-based band has been around since the early 90s, and their latest album ""Integrity Blues"" continues to showcase their talent and evolution in the genre.

There's a sense of maturity and vulnerability present in this album that sets it apart from their earlier work. You can feel the weight of the lyrics in tracks like ""You With Me"" and ""Get Right"", as Jim Adkins sings about love, loss, and the challenges of life. It's clear that this album was created from a place of introspection and contemplation.

One of the most interesting aspects of ""Integrity Blues"" is the collaboration between the band and producer Justin Meldal-Johnsen. He helped them craft a sound that's both familiar and fresh, combining elements of classic rock with a more modern approach. There are hints of U2 and Springsteen in tracks like ""Pass The Baby"" and ""Pretty Grids"", but overarching the album is the distinct sound of Jimmy Eat World.

As someone who's been a fan of the band for years, I was intrigued to see how they would evolve in this album. And while it may not be my favorite of theirs, ""Integrity Blues"" definitely stands on its own merit. It's an album that requires multiple listens to fully appreciate, with each track offering something new.

In terms of individual tracks, the standouts for me were ""Sure and Certain"" and ""The End Is Beautiful"". The former is a catchy and upbeat track that showcases the band's ability to create radio-friendly hits without sacrificing their authenticity. The latter is a slower, more introspective track that's hauntingly beautiful and, in my opinion, one of the strongest on the album.

All in all, ""Integrity Blues"" is a solid addition to Jimmy Eat World's discography. It may not be their most groundbreaking album, but it's certainly one that's worth giving a listen. It's clear that the band is still evolving and pushing themselves creatively, which is something that all musicians should strive for. I give ""Integrity Blues"" a rating of 7.3 out of 10.","1.

Kiss Me Deadly,Misty Medley,Rock,7.8,October 4 2005,Brian Howe,Contributor,"If the word ethereal did not exist, it would be necessary to invent it. Like so many other terms in our desperately comprehensive language-- unicorn, utopia, Kevin Federline-- it describes a concept that is essentially nonexistent. Ethereality is more of an absence than an entity, a lacuna in human understanding that encapsulates all things insubstantial and fleeting, intangible and delicate, ineffable and intuitively not-of-this-world. Certain sensations are impossible to explain without it, the diffuse frissons of post-rock (the dreamy, shoegazey '90s variety, not the modern conflated-with-math-rock stripe) ranking high among them. n Kiss Me Deadly's lusciously ethereal post-rock is leavened with stark contrasts--the tension between languorous shoegaze and kinetic shuffle beats, for instance--but the starkest one is between the band's pulpy name and their pristine music. Kiss Me Deadly is a Mickey Spillane book made into a 1955 film noir by director Robert Aldrich, and there's nothing less ethereal than the bleak, fatalistic archetypes of film noir; every face striped with the hard-edged shadows of moon-obscuring Venetian blinds. As Nitsuh Abebe pointed out in his recent Pitchfork article on '90s post-rock, ""early post-rock bands were constantly talking about the moon, with all of its usual connotations: Weightlessness, futurism, blank space, and serenity; dreamy, cerebral moods; and of course the beeps and hums of the old technology that first got people there."" As if to signal this affinity, Misty Medley's cover features a contour line drawing of a blank-eyed astronaut gazing past the moon and out of the frame, perhaps at shoes tied at the laces and drifting through space. Not content to recreate the cerebral palimpsests of Stereolab and Bark Psychosis, Kiss Me Deadly updates classic post-rock swoon with gentle dance rhythms and poppy, lucid song structures. The immediate grabber is Emily Elizabeth's breathy, helium-infused voice, which brims with more chirrups, squeaks, and indelible flourishes than anything this side of Life Without Buildings. As the gliding guitar melody of ""Dance 4"" finishes chiming out the national anthem of some lunar colony and settles into a fluid cadence, Elizabeth's stage whisper wafts into the mix, culminating in shrill screams that woozily bend into mellifluous vowels. On the lilting ""Dance 2"", she makes like a human slide-whistle, cooing and squealing about ""candy eyes"", and on the jittery ""Dance 3"", she sounds like a club-pop diva who wandered into Echo and the Bunnymen's practice space. If Elizabeth's voice is exquisitely odd, then Adam Poulin's serviceable croon is a welcome ballast. On ""Pop"", he rides the stuttering wave toward a grandiose chorus like an indie Bono; on ""Let's"", he hunkers down in sibilant percussion and a characteristic melody that pairs a dominant, simple guitar figure with a recessed, twitchy lead. The music's most striking quality is that of gliding, which requires equilibrium. Kiss Me Deadly, with their outrÃ© female and mundane male vocals, their coasting rhythms and anxious melodies, strikes a balance that holds Misty Medley easily, weightlessly aloft.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4602-misty-medley/,Alien8,2005.0,"Hello, fellow rock music enthusiasts!

Scuba,Update,Electronic,8.1,April 2 2013,Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,"Over the last decade, Hotflush has persisted as one of the leading names in the world of bass music, with founder Paul Rose producing some of the London-based label's strongest material to date. Rose has made music under several different monikers, but in the past few years, his work as Scuba has arguably proven most vital. Even for someone working in a genre that's as constantly stylistically fickle as bass, Rose has recently proven himself one of dance music's most inventive producers, someone who'd rather take bass places it rarely frequents than simply follow trends. In Scuba's world, nothing is off-limits-- chunky rave chords, huge-sounding trance melodies, house music's persistent thud-- and whatever's in his sonic arsenal is deployed to the point where bass as a genre is nearly and completely abandoned. An album-oriented artist working within a musical culture where albums have seldom been a point of focus, Rose's first two full-lengths as Scuba, 2008's A Mutual Antipathy and 2010's Triangulation, still featured an abundance of the clattering percussion and gray tones that many have come to associate with UK bass. Last year's Personality, then, was something completely different. Loaded with bold, strident melodies as well as a few stylistic left turns, Personality radiated an aura of positivity that's not easily found in the genre. Less of a maximalist than Glasgow's manically minded Rustie, and not as much of a sensualist as Hotflush-signed duo Sepalcure, Personality regardless cemented Rose as an up-with-people artist, the type of producer who's not afraid to make something crowd-pleasing even if it means sacrificing a level of subtlety in the process. When taken in chronological order, Scuba's catalog shows clear artistic progression and growth-- which is why it's a little curious that Update, the digital-only compilation that cherrypicks highlights from the project's seven-year existence, abandons chronology entirely in favor of establishing something approaching a narrative (it's probably not a coincidence that the last track here is called ""Lights Out""). The embrace of a non-linear tracklist proves effective, though, in connecting the dots between early material and more recent revelations, proving that even at his sparsest, Rose's keen ear for melody has proven as effective even when his hand tips the scales towards subtlety. The seismic depth of this stuff isn't rude by any means, but it possesses a disorienting richness regardless, to the point where even the crispest percussive touches seem to reverberate endlessly into blackness. Update's tracks unfold patiently, as even the most chaotic cuts sound micro-managed for maximum effectiveness, so when Rose zooms out to let, say, an expressive synth wash enter the fray, he's in no rush to get back to what he was on previously. He wants you to feel it, to the point where the feeling becomes awesomely overwhelming. The predilection for creating moments of pure awe is probably why I often find myself reaching for the Chemical Brothers after listening to Scuba. His recent material suggests that Rose shares their-- and, by extension, progressive house's-- psychedelic tendencies, but it's important to remember the Chem Bros' skewed pop instincts are what's continually ensured their commercial relevancy, too, and at his best Rose exhibits similar smarts. Personality cuts ""July"" and ""NE1BUTU"" represent some of his most beatifically straightforward material to date, the former employing synth stabs reminiscent of Van Halen's ""Jump"" and the latter cramming a wealth of sample triggers into its too-tough front half before declarative piano chords and a neck-whipping diva vocal tornadoes through the proceedings. Then, there's ""Adrenalin"". The 2011 single and deserved centerpiece of Update was, at the time of its release, the first taste of what was to come on Personality, and it arguably still stands as Rose's most excellent work to date. Over the course of eight minutes that feel as if they could go for another hour or more, Rose carefully builds a foundation around an endless repetition of the titular vocal sample-- a 4/4 thud, some shuddering 808 figures, expressive washes of sound-- before, at the tune's near halfway point, a tidal wave of synths crash through to create something that's intangibly anthemic and irrepressibly epic, a glistening trance anthem that even those who still think of trance as a dirty word can embrace. It's the sound of staring into the sun for just the right amount of time-- or, having your mind blown by something with the transportative properties of ""Adrenalin"" while out at a club-- and it represents Rose at his most creatively generous. Rose's output as Scuba dates back seven years, and as the relatively meek title of the compilation suggests, that's a span of time that doesn't necessarily demand a ""best of"" release. There are many producers, both in bass music and other strains of dance, whose catalogs demand this type of treatment for a variety of reasons, least of which being sheer availability of their catalog to those not willing to do the deep digging. (With Rose, you can get a lot from the readily available full-lengths and EPs, even if seeking out his lesser-known work and singles as SCB proves equally rewarding.) Update, then, gets by on the sheer pleasures it provides, a collection that transcends necessity on its own merit.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17905-scuba-update/,Hotflush,2013.0,"If you're a fan of electronic music, then you've probably heard of Scuba. The British producer, born Paul Rose, has been making music for over a decade, blending elements of techno, dubstep, and garage into a distinct sound that's equal parts introspective and danceable. His latest album, Update, is a fantastic addition to his already impressive discography.

Before we dive into the music, let's talk about the band's history. Scuba emerged from the vibrant dubstep scene in the late 2000s, but he didn't stay in any one genre for long. He was quick to experiment with sounds and techniques, releasing a series of EPs and albums that showcased his growth as a producer. He even founded his own record label, Hotflush Recordings, to nurture new talent.

With Update, Scuba demonstrates just how far he's come. The album is a reflection of his recent move to Berlin, which he's described as ""a big reset button."" You can hear the influence of the city's underground club scene in the album's pounding rhythms and icy melodies. But at the same time, the album is deeply introspective, with moments of beauty and melancholy that are uniquely Scuba's.

Take, for example, the opening track ""Levitation."" It begins with ominous synths and a hazy beat, building tension until a robotic voice declares ""I will rise again."" The song then explodes into a cascade of shimmering arpeggios, evoking a feeling of weightlessness and wonder. It's the kind of track that could work equally well on a dancefloor or in a pair of headphones.

Other highlights of the album include ""Forgiveness,"" a track that starts with a pounding kick drum and evolves into a haunting meditation on the power of letting go. ""Skeletal"" is a frantic, paranoid track that sounds like it could be the theme music for a sci-fi chase scene. And ""Speak"" is a moody piece of electronica that features haunting vocals from Len Faki.

All in all, Update is an album that showcases Scuba's versatility and creativity as a producer. It's full of surprises, but never feels unfocused or disjointed. It's an album that's equally at home on a club sound system or in the comfort of your own home. It's an album that's made for repeat listens, with nuances and details that reveal themselves over time.

Personally, I found Update to be an enthralling and immersive listening experience. I enjoyed how the album balanced the intense, energetic beats with moments of introspection and reflection. I appreciated the attention to detail in the production, from the crisp percussion to the swirling synths. And I admired the album's ability to transport me to a different world, one that's both exciting and contemplative.

Overall, I highly recommend Update to anyone who's a fan of electronic music. It's a great example of what the genre can achieve when it's in the hands of a skilled and imaginative producer like Scuba. With a rating of 8.1 out of 10, it's an album that's definitely worth your time and attention.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed.

Serge Gainsbourg,Histoire de Melody Nelson,Pop/R&B,10.0,March 26 2009,Tom Ewing,Contributor,"Serge Gainsbourg had no great attachment to genre. By the time he came to rock music, in his early 40s, the French star had traced his oblique, provocative course through chanson (French vocal music), jazz, and light pop. He'd made percussive café jams about suicide and given Eurovision popstrels France Gall and Françoise Hardy songs full of blowjob puns. Later on he'd make a rock'n'roll album about the Nazis and a reggae take on the French national anthem. A pattern emerges: Gainsbourg hops from style to style, but with a terrific instinct for finding the most startling content for any given form. So it's no surprise his rock work-- the early 1970s albums, of which Histoire de Melody Nelson is the first and finest-- was so original. Melody Nelson is a collaboration with composer and arranger Jean-Claude Vannier, who assembled a bunch of top sessionmen for the album. But Gainsbourg and Vannier had little interest in the conventions that had accreted around early 70s rock. Like a lot of 1971 records, Histoire de Melody Nelson is a concept album: Unlike most, it's only 28 minutes long. The songs are lavishly orchestrated, yet the dominant instrument isn't guitar or organ but rather Herbie Flowers' lascivious, treacly bass, playing a seedy, rambling take on funk. That bass is the first sound you hear on Melody Nelson, quietly tracking up and down in a windscreen-wiper rhythm: Gainsbourg starts talking in French 30 seconds later, describing a night drive in a Rolls Royce Silver Ghost. The album is routinely described as ""cinematic,"" but the music is more of a mindtrack than a soundtrack-- a tar pit of introspection when Gainsbourg's brooding narrator is alone at the record's beginning and end, then giddy and savage by turns as he conducts his affair with the 15-year-old Melody across the short tracks in the album's middle. One of these-- ""Ballade de Melody Nelson""-- is, even at two minutes, one of Gainsbourg's most assured and alluring pop songs. A lot of Gainsbourg's records are hard sells for Anglophone ears-- the music is there to illuminate and pace the man's riotous, sensual wordplay. But Gainsbourg's alliance with Vannier produced a true collaboration: The arrangements seem to respond almost intuitively to the twists in Gainsbourg's language and narrative, to the point where they're carrying as much storytelling weight as the words. Even if your French stops at ""bonjour"", the music lets you know that this is a record about a dark, obsessional love. On ""L'hôtel Particulier"", for instance-- describing the sleazy grandeur of the rented rooms where the narrator and Melody make love-- Gainsbourg's voice shudders with lust and dread, and the music responds, flares of piano and string breaking into the song over an impatient bassline. The actual story of Histoire de Melody Nelson is pretty negligible in any case-- man meets girl, man seduces girl, girl dies in freak plane crash. Melody herself (played by Jane Birkin, Gainsbourg's then-lover) is a cipher-- a breathed name, a ticklish squeal or two, and red hair. The album is all about its narrator: A natural obsessive just looking for an object; introspective before he meets Melody, more so after her death. First and final tracks ""Melody"" and ""Cargo Culte"" are musical siblings, with only the wordless chorales on ""Cargo Culte"" really distinguishing them. Together these songs take up more than half the record, and when people claim Melody Nelson as an influence, it's almost certainly with this pair in mind. The soundworld they create is like nothing else in rock-- orchestra, bass, and voice circling one another, blending slow funk, intimate mumbling, and widescreen scope. One precedent is the epic soul Isaac Hayes had been pioneering, but where Hot Buttered Soul is full of warmth and engagement, the bookend tracks of Melody Nelson are a trip through far more hostile territories, the black spaces of a man's interior. Gainsbourg realized he'd made something special-- he named his publishing company Melody Nelson after his fictional muse-- but, restless as ever, he didn't follow it up: His next album was a sequence of pretty acoustic songs, mostly about shit. Herbie Flowers, whose bass is the undertow pulling the album together, surfaced a year later playing on Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side"", whose bassline is the first ripple of Melody Nelson's wider pop culture influence. Since then it's been left to others-- Jarvis Cocker, Beck, Tricky, Air, Broadcast-- to pick up this record's breadcrumb trail. But Gainsbourg's dark focus, and Vannier's responsiveness, aren't easily equalled. This reissue on luxuriously hefty vinyl is the first time the album's been released in the U.S.-- a superb opportunity to hear a record that's been occasionally imitated but never matched.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12852-histoire-de-melody-nelson/,"Light in the Attic,Light in the Attic",1971.0,"Ah, Serge Gainsbourg’s ‘Histoire de Melody Nelson’, what a masterpiece. This French pop and R&B album, with its haunting and seductive sound, is truly a work of art. With a rating of 10.0 out of 10, it is easy to see why this album is considered a classic.

If we look into the history of Gainsbourg’s career, we can see that he was a musician and a songwriter who left a considerable mark in the music industry. Known for his controversial lyrics, he pushed the boundaries of traditional French music, incorporating elements of jazz, rock, reggae and funk. All in all, he was a true iconoclast, and ‘Histoire de Melody Nelson’ is a testament to this.

The album was released in 1971, and it tells the story of a teenage English girl named Melody Nelson, who is run over by Gainsbourg’s Rolls Royce. Her character is complex and intriguing, beautifully portrayed through the music and Gainsbourg’s sultry voice. The arrangements are incredibly innovative, with the use of strings, a variety of percussion, and harpsichord. Each song on this album flows seamlessly into the next, creating a narrative that becomes almost hypnotic. It is an ode to love, loss, obsession and, ultimately, redemption.

What I appreciate the most about this album is its ability to create an intense atmospheric experience. As soon as the first notes of the opening track ‘Melody’ begin, you are transported to a different world. The music paints a picture so vivid that you can almost see the drama unfolding before you. From the sensuality of ‘Ballade de Melody Nelson’ to the angst of ‘En Melody’, the album’s emotional range is astounding.

Personally, I think that ‘Histoire de Melody Nelson’ is a masterpiece that every music lover should have in their collection. It is a unique and innovative album that still sounds fresh and exciting, even after all these years. Gainsbourg’s voice is just so captivating, and the music is so beautifully arranged that it is easy to get lost in its world. It is a rare gem that stands the test of time and continues to inspire new generations of musicians.","Step 1: Review A is more detailed and provides more contextual information about Serge Gainsbourg and his music style.

Obnox,Boogalou Reed,Rock,7.8,February 3 2015,Marc Masters,Contributor,"If you had to force a standard narrative on Obnox, the solo project of Cleveland’s Lamont ""Bim"" Thomas, it might go something like this: prolific, lo-fi one-man band steps into a proper studio to make his most accessible and acclaimed album—last year’s wide-ranging, hard-hitting *Louder Space—*and must grapple with how to follow that peak. The problem with that story is that Thomas isn’t much of a grappler when it comes to making records. Boogalou Reed, released less than a year after Louder Space, finds him still cockily speeding along, cranking out high-octane, hip-hop-influenced garage rock like it’s a spiritual calling. Even if Thomas is a song-making factory, Boogalou Reed sounds nothing like an assembly line. In contrast to *Louder Space—*his first full-on exploration of his rap leanings—this is more of a straight-up garage-punk album, filled with hyper-fuzz guitars, stomping beats, and snarling vocals. That’s reflected in some of Thomas’s rock-history-sniffing song titles: ""Cynthia Piper at the Gates of Dawn"", ""Too Punk Shakur"", the title track. Judged solely on the scale of how hard it rocks, Boogalou Reed is a head-rinsing success. But Thomas has been at his craft too long to settle for anything that simple. He knows the value of head-down rock action, but he also knows how to layer that with something more complex. Most of these 15 tracks are miles-deep sonically, with guitars piled high, beats thickened into gunshots, and vocals that morph hip-hop fire with punk frenzy. The result is just as varied—albeit in a sneakier way—as Louder Space. Blink and you might miss the twists and turns, as Thomas dives into sultry noise-R&B (""Situation""), stoner grunge (""Protopipe""), rap-metal (""Watching You""), organ-driven '60s rock (""Empire""), and even a demolishing cover of ""Ohio"" that beats Neil Young at his own guitar-growl game. What glues all these sides of Obnox together is the way Thomas infects every moment with electricity. The lightning-bolt energy that courses through Boogalou Reed’s 15 tracks is a kind of genre of its own, a sonic signature that Thomas can fit many styles into without losing the mark of his bold handwriting. As he put it recently, ""White cats can get into it. Hip-hop niggas can get into it. Punks can get into it. Indie rock dude, he’s already in. Noiseheads. It’s all in there."" Yet none of those categories takes over; you never get the sense that Thomas is trying on costumes or speaking a second language. His supreme confidence steamrolls any worries of dilettantism. Steamrolling is basically Thomas’ job now. Since launching Obnox after years spent in some of Ohio’s best garage bands, he’s slammed forward with all the force of a smoke-blowing engine. (He’s already got another record on the way soon, a ""punk rock concept album"" called Know America about taking over a radio station.) But that steamroller metaphor doesn’t catch how Thomas’ music is as subtle as it is pummeling. His business is all about charging forward, but his art is about more than just the moment.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20168-boogalou-reed/,12XU,2015.0,"Obnox, the power rock trio known for blending together punk, garage, and funk, has returned with their latest album: ""Boogalou Reed"". This album is a reflection of their evolution as a band- it's a unique, genre-bending experience that takes their experimental sound to a whole new level.

The album kicks off with the track ""Freaky,"" which starts off with an energetic riff that harks back to the raw, no-frills style of garage rock. The lead vocalist Bim Thomas announces himself with his signature gravelly voice and sets the tone for the album with the shouty chorus. The track effortlessly flows into the next, ""Enter The Hater,"" which has an instantly catchy rhythm that got me nodding my head on the first listen.

As the album progresses, it's clear that the band has influenced a lot from Afro-Caribbean rhythms, and it's highlighted in tracks like ""Punk Money"" and ""C'mon Black"". These songs feature almost tribal rhythms that are propelled by the drums and infused with guitar riffs- a perfect mix of punk and funk.

There's also an impressive diversity on this album. ""The Cooh"" is a perfect example of a slow-burning track with seductive wah-wah undertones, while ""Get Down"" is more of a classic rock 'n' roll piece with a catchy hook that immediately sticks to the mind.

What I especially appreciate about ""Boogalou Reed"" is that the band has a distinct sound that sets them apart from others in the genre. They are unafraid to mix in influences from salsa, reggae, and various other genres, which gives them an unmatched level of creativity.

In terms of production quality, Obnox has done an excellent job in maintaining a raw sound that's genuine and unaffected by external factors. The mix of analog instruments, gritty production, and organic sound effects creates a feeling that can only be achieved through excellent musicianship.

Overall, ""Boogalou Reed"" by Obnox is a solid rock album that hits all the right notes, stands out in the genre, and has me excited for future projects by the band. I give this album a 7.8 out of 10, and I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking to expand their musical palate or seeking a fresh sound in the rock genre.","1.

Steve Earle & the Dukes,Terraplane,Folk/Country,6.3,February 25 2015,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Steve Earle has learned to compartmentalize. In the twenty-first century he has released an album of Townes Van Zandt covers, a few collections of agit-Americana, and another inspired by the immigrant sounds of New York City—each one so laser-focused musically and thematically that they sound like concept albums. On one hand, the approach gives each record its own distinctive identity within his catalog. When his overarching subject was the idiocy of the Bush Administration he hit paydirt: Jerusalem and The Revolution Starts… Now had a hardscrabble righteousness only intensified by the fact that few other singer-songwriters were tackling that particular subject matter at that particular time. Both have aged more gracefully than their topicality would have suggested. On the other hand, that urge to cordon off genres and ideas seems particularly odd for an artist who changed the course of country music in the 1980s by insisting that everything could be commingled freely. His 1986 debut Guitar Town and 1988's Copperhead Road melded rock guitars and country songwriting, honkytonk rowdiness and folky gentleness, as if to rebuke the timid conservatism of the Nashville mainstream. Even in the 1990s, he emerged from a four-year stint in the clink with a string of adventurous records that made forays into doo-wop, Beatlesque pop, Civil War storytelling, and twangy psychedelica. That eclecticism was—and still is—rousing, yet nowadays each of those creative impulses would get its own neat album. Earle's latest is also his most specific: Terraplane is his Texas blues album, an homage to the likes of Lightnin' Hopkins and Mance Lipscomb, Robert Johnson and Stevie Ray Vaughn, Freddy King and ZZ Top. There are no cheeseball Blueshammer theatrics, which often accompany blues records made by non-blues artists. Earle's more interested in craft than ostentation, and his touring band the Dukes keep things raw and wiry, as though everything was caught in one take during Shiner runs. Only on ""Baby's Just as Mean as Me"", a he said/she said duet with Eleanor Whitmore, do Earle's blues sound less than casually persuasive. To his credit, Earle understands that Texas is a big place and therefore Texas blues is a broad term that encompasses various sounds and song forms. Terraplane volleys from acoustic to electric, from solo delivery to full-band performances, from pop melodies to spoken-word verses. He conjures some fire and brimstone on a talking blues called ""The Tennessee Kid"", which would be one of the best songs here if it didn't so readily buy into some of the persistent myths orbiting the blues: reaching the crossroads, meeting the devil, selling your soul. These seem like tired tropes, equivalent to naming your album after a Robert Johnson song, yet Earle brings so much grit and wiliness to the song that you almost don't roll your eyes when he name-drops ""Bob Johnson."" The blues is often mischaracterized as uniformly worried and woeful, as though a hellhound were on every strummer's trail, yet that is only one facet of the form. It can also be funny, or randy, and it's this last trait that Earle taps into most eagerly, as Terraplane is his lustiest album in a long while. Sex is the major theme, and Earle beholds his hard-on with a self-effacing chuckle. The first song is called ""Baby Baby Baby (Baby)"", and that parenthetical aside is not only his best punchline but a winking nod to the ridiculousness of it all. Casting him as the leering oldie, ""Go-Go Boots Are Back"" may be his most frivolous song yet, but its lack of gravity is freeing, even funny. Nevertheless, the concept framing Terraplane also reduces its scope and limits its impact. It's good for what it is—better than it needs to be, in fact—yet what it is is only a fraction of what it could be, if only Earle would stop trying to tidy up his inspirations.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20282-terraplane/,New West,2015.0,"If you're a fan of Steve Earle and the Dukes or simply appreciate good folk/country music, you'll want to check out their latest album Terraplane. I had the pleasure of listening to this album recently, and I've got to say, it's a pretty solid effort.

For those who aren't familiar with Steve Earle and the Dukes, they've been around for a while. Earle himself has been making music since the mid-1980s, and he's got an impressive track record, having released numerous critically acclaimed albums over the years. The Dukes, for their part, have been working with Earle off and on since the early 90s. Their familiarity with each other really shows on Terraplane, as they're in sync throughout the album.

The album takes its name from the 1930s Chevrolet model and was recorded in just four days in Nashville. In fact, Earle was so impressed with the sound of the studio that he wanted to use it on the album. That studio is the famous Sound Emporium, and it's been around since the 60s, producing classic albums for the likes of Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, and many others. Earle has described the studio as having ""a sound that nobody else has."" That unique sound is definitely present on Terraplane, making it a treat for anyone who loves that classic analog sound.

The songs on the album are a mix of new material and covers, but they all fit together beautifully. Earle's voice is as rough around the edges as ever, which gives the album an authentic feel. The musicianship is top-notch, with the Dukes providing sterling accompaniment throughout. They're particularly effective on tracks like ""The Tennessee Kid"" and ""So You Wannabe an Outlaw,"" where the guitar playing is especially strong.

Personally, I found Terraplane to be an enjoyable album, if not exactly earth-shattering. It's got a nice mix of uptempo tracks and slower, more introspective ones. While there's no single standout track that stands out, the album as a whole is satisfying. It's the kind of album that's great to put on in the background while doing other things or to really sink into and enjoy on a lazy afternoon.

All in all, Steve Earle and the Dukes' Terraplane is a solid effort that's definitely worth a listen. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the band or simply enjoy good folk/country music, there's something here for you. While it's not the kind of album that will break new ground or change your life, it's a fine addition to Earle's impressive body of work. So go ahead and give it a spin!","1.

The Body,"Master, We Perish",Metal,8.1,May 3 2013,Grayson Currin,Contributor,"As the Body, thunderous drummer Lee Buford and murderous screamer and guitarist Chip King have been lashing at the foundation of doom metal for a decade. They’ve issued a steady stream of splits and collaborations, singles and short-run discs, but their most prominent public moment arrived in 2010 with the masterful All the Waters of the Earth Turn to Blood. With an all-female choir and sinister samples, the Body applied a seasick sense of motion to truly corrupted misanthropy, with impenetrable distortion piled onto the band’s lurching and jerking spans. In the interim, they’ve paired with post-metal troupe Braveyoung on the stage and in the studio, grown into a trio and occasionally a quartet, pared back to duo form, and moved from Providence, RI, to their current base of Portland, OR. The time spent in flux seems to have only galvanized the Body’s central focus-- that is, to sound completely terrifying, in an Armageddon-with-a-view, end-of-everything manner. Master, We Perish­ is the new three-song, 18-minute EP from the Body. It lashes at perceived and much-debated divisions between metal and noise so hard and so fast that its tremendous squall and anthemic structures might actually be the sound of those fortified seams splintering. Master, We Perish not only finds the Body at its most punishing and paralyzing but also at its most diverse, a marvel considering the length. Opener “The Ebb and Flow of Tides in a Sea of Ash” does its monumental damage in less than three minutes, with air raid sirens invoking a tide of guitar static and cymbal smashes that make you consider finding shelter, even if you’re only wearing headphones. In the song’s back half, King’s six-string upheaval shifts into piercing, sustained tones, while Buford now rumbles through the rest the kit, favoring body blows to eardrum lashes. But the Body somehow embeds a hook into all of this, meaning that you might want to throw up your fists and shout along with King about collapsing structures and forms. Be prepared to be blindsided by a wave of pain, though, like a quarterback being sacked from the back in one of those NFL Films slow-motion frames. It’s every bit as exhilarating and intimidating as you might hope, and shows the Body joining acts like WOLD, Sutekh Hexen, Locrian, and even Sunn O))) in the masterful art of merging blackened noise and damaged metal. That’s not even the first three minutes. For “The Blessed Lay Down and Writhe in Agony”, the Body bleeds tension, with soprano vocals spiraling over cross-talking samples. A simple, slow riff and an indirect drum patter gather slowly, supporting King’s falsetto screech. The sound of a pump-action shotgun being slid into firing position serves as the valve’s release, opening a torrent of drone and rumble that funnels into a disastrous coda. King, Buford, the samples and, basically the whole world sound as though they’re being swallowed. The finale, “Worship”, lacks the immediacy of its companion pieces, but its slow rise through martial drums and a scramble of found voices and manipulated notes suggests the Body’s developing ability to bait its audience with control and nuance. They micromanage the implied chaos until there is no more sonic space, no more spare slivers for sound. When the barrier finally breaks, the Body emerges with all of the atavistic doom force that initially made the band so compelling. Here, the sound is caked in static, a great grey noise worn like a badge of courage and a come-at-me middle finger. Feel free to tell these two they don’t belong in your clique, but I’m willing to admit I’m not that brave.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17970-the-body-master-we-perish/,At a Loss,2013.0,"If you're looking for some heavy metal that will send chills down your spine, then The Body's latest album, ""Master, We Perish,"" is exactly what you need. With a rating of 8.1 out of 10, this album is a perfect fit for those who are into the darker and heavier side of metal.

The Body has been in the metal scene for over two decades, and their experience really shows on this album. From the opening track, ""A Lament,"" you are thrown into a world of chaos and despair. The vocalist's guttural growls and screams cut through the thick layers of distortion with ease, creating a truly chilling atmosphere.

One of the things that makes The Body stand out from other metal bands is their willingness to explore different sounds and textures. On ""Master, We Perish,"" they incorporate elements of noise, industrial, and even ambient music, creating a sound that is truly unique. The track ""An Altar or a Grave"" is a great example of this, with its droning synths and haunting vocals.

The album's creation story is just as intriguing as the music itself. According to the band, they wanted to create something that was both heavy and emotional, and I would say that they succeeded. The lyrics deal with themes of decay, death, and despair, with each track painting a picture of a broken and desolate world.

Personally, I found this album to be a truly immersive experience. The Body's music doesn't just assault your ears; it wraps itself around you like a thick blanket, suffocating you with its darkness and intensity. It's the kind of music that you don't just listen to - you feel it in your bones.

Overall, ""Master, We Perish"" is a fantastic album for fans of heavy metal. The Body has managed to create something truly unique and memorable with this release, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next. If you're looking for something that will give you goosebumps and make your heart race, then give this album a listen. You won't be disappointed.","1.

Sloan,Between the Bridges,Rock,7.9,September 12 1999,Jeremy Schneyer,,"Sloan is one of the only bands around who can take the music of classic, venerated bands, rip it off wholesale, and still end up creating something fresh, interesting, and exciting. With a few exceptions, their entire career has been based on taking the music of their heroes, boiling it down in a tasty pop stew, and calling it their own. Witness 1997's One Chord to Another-- the album was filled to the brim with Beatles songs written not by Lennon/ McCartney, but by Murphy/ Pentland/ Ferguson/ Scott. Sure, these songs might sound like a lot of shit you've heard before but as you listen, Sloan's affectations and flourishes materialize and you hear the band for what they really are-- not a cloying, uninspired rip-off, but an intellegent band with a sense of humor and a great ear for pop hooks. Whether it's in the Fab Four disguise of One Chord, the British shoegazer aping of their DGC debut, Smeared, or seen through the swaggering filter of their recent obsession with the '70s, these songs eventually reveal themselves as the distinct product of Sloan regardless of what disguise thay might take. It's hasn't really been that long since their last record, 1998's Navy Blues. The record took One Chord's Beatles obsession, added a few shots of Cheap Trick and a pinch of the Raspberries, and came out with one of their most affecting concoctions to date. So it only makes sense that I would be somewhat wary of Between the Bridges. The first time through, it almost seemed like they'd taken a turn down Disappointment Lane. See, instead of raiding 1970s freedom rock for ideas, Sloan seem to have grabbed a fistful of Fleetwood Mac, Todd Rundgren and, of course, the Who. The funny thing is, that despite all odds, this ends up working just as well. Now, I'm no fan of cheesy '70s pop, but when Sloan updates the sound, something clicks. My theory: at the core, the members of Sloan are Grade A songwriters. Despite the semi- ridiculous exterior, there's virtually no fluff on this album. The lyrics are (relatively) intelligent, and the songs are put together immaculately. After years of acceptance in their Canadian homeplace, Sloan are finally starting to get a good reputation in the United States among indie rock fans. But they've still got a long way to go-- at a recent Seattle appearance, the publicity for the show was so non-existent that no one heard about it until the day before it happened, causing infinite sadness among at least two Seattlites who didn't find out about it until too late (chiefly myself and my roommate). So wake up, you guys! If you like pop music, and you aren't already a Sloan fan, go buy this album and become one.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7248-between-the-bridges/,Murder,1999.0,"Rock music has always been a genre that's hard to resist, and Sloan's ""Between the Bridges"" is a fascinating addition that certainly brings a new level of sophistication and creativity to the table. With a rating of 7.9 out of 10, this album is definitely one to check out for anyone who loves rock music.

For those unfamiliar with the band Sloan, they were formed in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1991. The band members include Chris Murphy, Patrick Pentland, Jay Ferguson, and Andrew Scott - and their years of experience in the industry are evident in this album. ""Between the Bridges"" is their sixth studio album, released in 1999.

The album story indicates that ""Between the Bridges"" came together in a particularly tumultuous time for the band. It's said that during the recording of the album, they were in danger of being dropped by their record label and that the band members also clashed with each other while creating it. But despite these challenges, the end result is a collection of eleven songs that showcase the band's abilities.

Upon listening to this album, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the sheer variety of styles and sounds you'll hear. The band's diversity shines through with tracks like ""Friendship"" and ""Autobiography"", and they succeed in developing a unique and memorable sound that speaks to their strengths as a group.

One of my favorite tracks is ""The N.S."", which begins with a droning guitar chord progression that quickly evolves into a fast-paced, energetic song that had me bobbing my head on the first listen. With a catchy chorus and killer guitar riffs, ""The N.S."" is an excellent representation of what this album has to offer.

Another standout track is ""All By Ourselves"", arguably the heaviest song on the album. This song does an excellent job of capturing the mood of the moment, with driving drums and crunchy guitars creating a thrillingly tense atmosphere.

Overall, ""Between the Bridges"" is an album that any rock enthusiast should have in their collection. It's remarkable that the band Sloan was able to produce such a unique collection of songs in a recording process that was reportedly quite challenging. This album is a testament to their resiliency and creativity - and I can confidently say that this album is a must-listen for anyone looking for fresh and dynamic rock music.","1.

Richard X,"X-Factor, Vol. 1",Pop/R&B,7.7,September 7 2003,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"""We're the Human League and we're pleased to be playing in the carpark of a 7-11."" And I thought Philip Oakey was dry and droll on record. It seemed a bit pathetic when he said it this summer at a Chicago street fair. At the end of the night, when people were literally dancing in the streets, it made sense. Oakey, his bandmates, and the communal spirit of communicative music were giving the people what they want: an irresistible, good time. The sound of the crowd singing along to ""Love Action"" and ""Don't You Want Me"" is the sort of party that mashup producer Richard X might have enjoyed-- and not just because the Human League are a well from which he frequently draws. The producer, who came to prominence as Girls on Top with a trio of electro/female-vocalized mashups (including ""I Wanna Dance with Numbers"", which transformed Whitney Houston from Dionne Warwick to Grace Jones), is obviously a child of the 1980s and a believer in the power of pop. ""Let's take it back to the 1980s,"" exclaims a sample on ""Rock Jacket"", from Richard X's debut album, Presents His X-Factor Volume One. ""Eighties music/ Rock it/ Lose it,"" it chimes-- often in almost indecipherable vocoder-- over a sea of synths (some Heaven 17, some Jan Hammer), the white-funk bass from Spandau Ballet's ""Chant No. 1"", and a schizophrenic drum machine. It's like taking a wondrous spin through the Vice City radio dial. Except neither it, nor the rest of the album, is really nostalgia per se. Unlike much of the regressive rock it's not reclamation, a reach back into the past to reject the present. Unlike most of kitsch-rock, it's not even postmodernist, because the appropriation and combination of eras isn't done with a wink. Richard X is more lamenting the loss of some ideas from the 80s-- most obviously the lack of New Pop sensibilities in the charts. But he's breaking boundaries instead of turning back the clock, celebrating a life loving music and making it the only untraditional way he knows how or is able to. Richard X's outsider approach is almost reminiscent of The Shaggs' heartbreaking cover of ""Yesterday Once More"", on which you can almost hear them huddled under the covers with their transistor, desperate to make music. Fortunately for Richard, technology has bridged the gulf between will/ideas and traditional compositional skill. Like 2 Many DJs, Richard is using his cunning, ear, and a lifetime of fandom to celebrate music's elasticity, and he's using the relative ease and speed of digital production to lay waste to eras: past, present, future. X-Factor features the first official U.S. release of the Sugababes' cover of a Girls on Top single: The Tubeway Army/Adina Howard bootleg, ""Freak Like Me"", which shot to No. 1 in the UK. Also included is another of his official releases, Liberty X's ""Being Nobody"" (Human League vs. Rufus and Chaka Khan). The Sugababes track still sounds as fresh and unstoppable as ever; the Liberty X is more of a grower, at best. Among X-Factor's other guests is Kelis, whose low profile in the U.S. needed to be rectified about four years ago. (If her new record, now delayed until 2004, ends up the victim of long-predicted Neptunes shark-jumping, she'll be the unluckiest woman in pop.) The electro-soul of Kelis' solo records is a template also followed by Richard X on collaborations with former Soul II Soul vocalist Caron Wheeler (reconstructing Lil' Louis' early house track, ""Club Lonely"") and Javine. Ex-Flying Lizards singer Deborah Evans-Strickland-- sounding like a Miss Kittin prototype-- appears on a pair of tracks, including an almost shuffle-tech version of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's ""Walk on By."" Tiga's ""You (Better Let Me Love You x4) Tonight"" proves he's best at straight-ahead electro-pop than comedy covers. But the most interesting collaborator is Pulp vocalist Jarvis Cocker (wow, are those ever painful words to type), who closes the proceedings with an electronic cheek-to-cheek with Hope Sandoval, mixing his own professions of love and lust with Mazzy Star's ""Fade Into You."" So how is this not all nostalgia again? Because Richard X is the perfect contemporary artist, a deconstructionist who reaches through the past and celebrates both the near-elimination of the Then and Now in our file-sharing/reissue era and the democratization of music making of this new digital era. That you can purchase this in a shop instead of gawk at it on Artofthemix.com is a testimony to Richard X's PDA Rolodex, innovation, and intuition. That you'll want to buy it-- that it sounds so fresh and joyous-- is a testimony to not only Richard X, but also Paul Morley and New Pop, electro and club culture, U.S. R&B; producers such as Rodney Jerkins or The Neptunes, and anyone else over the past 20 years who argued for the timelessness of sounds that too many people claim are mere ephemera.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6897-x-factor-vol-1/,Astralwerks,2003.0,"If you're looking for a fresh and danceable sound that blends elements of pop and R&B, then you're going to want to check out Richard X's debut album, ""X-Factor, Vol. 1.""

Richard X is an electro-pop artist from Portsmouth, England, who made a name for himself in the UK music scene in the early 2000s. He first gained widespread recognition as a remixer for artists like Sugababes and Kylie Minogue, before releasing ""X-Factor, Vol. 1"" in 2003.

What makes this album unique is how it infuses the sounds of classic pop and R&B with modern electronic production techniques. From the opening track ""Into U,"" Richard X hooks listeners with a bouncing beat and a funky bassline that will have you tapping your feet in no time.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Being Nobody,"" which features vocals from former Liberty X member, Michelle Escoffery. The song's irresistible chorus and catchy melody make it a perfect dance-floor anthem, and it's easy to see why it became a top-3 hit in the UK.

Another gem on the album is ""Finest Dreams,"" which features vocals from Kelis. The song's fun and playful lyrics, combined with a bouncy beat and a groovy guitar riff, make it an instant classic. You can't help but smile and sing along to the chorus: ""You're my finest dream come true.""

Overall, ""X-Factor, Vol. 1"" is a refreshing and fun album that showcases Richard X's talent as a producer and songwriter. While the album may not be groundbreaking, it's an enjoyable listening experience that combines elements of classic pop and R&B with modern electronic production.

G Perico,2 Tha Left,Rap,7.7,December 13 2017,Jay Balfour,Contributor,"G Perico might initially sound like a straight-ahead West Coast nostalgist. But if he’s craning his neck to look back, he does not stumble over himself in the process. There’s no way around the DJ Quik, Too $hort, and Eazy-E comparisons: Perico lilts his nasally voice with the same crassly blustering swagger, atop similarly synthed G-funk. Still, there’s nothing imitative in his music, and the 29-year old Perico doesn’t fetishize the past, even when stomping around South Central in a still-wet Jheri curl. He’s spent 2017 on a forward-looking tear, releasing a fiercely concentrated solo debut this spring, and sharing space with a pair of fellow up-and-coming California rappers on a collaborative mixtape called G-Worthy this fall. 2 Tha Left, then, is G Perico’s third full-length release of the year, and it feels like a bit of a heat-check. 2 Tha Left is similarly spare as Perico’s last solo outing, though it is bookended by matching intro and outro tracks—which add time and sound a little out of place. This solo album also, for better or worse, folds in a busier cast of featured rappers. TeeCee4800 and A.D. nail their appearances on “What Up Cuz,” building it into a sinister turf taunt. Meanwhile, Curren$y sounds lazily at home on the steal-your-girl “Send Her Home,” clocking in the same verse he’s been rapping for years alongside Perico’s bouncy shit-talk. There isn’t a moment where Perico is upstaged, and his immediate charm is in the stylish near yelp of his rapping voice, the way he struts over a beat. He seems to always be at the top of his register, but he tucks a deceptive range of perky melody into each verse and hook. All of this plays out over a sleek G-funk backdrop, with plenty of playful nuance in the production. Sleigh bells briefly shake in time with the bass on “Mind Yours,” and some pizzicato tucked deep in the mix on “Affiliated” lends the stomping anthem a delicate menace. Still, it’s the synths that build the world. Most of them are up-front and warm but they take various shapes: pierced whistling, chunky bass tones, shimmering atmosphere. Perico raps with a casual, plain-spoken lyricism. He never explains or obscures a detail in his storytelling, a writing philosophy he captures in the album’s bark of an opening bar: “Don’t ask me how I do it, watch how I move.” 2 Tha Left catches him perpetually stuck in the middle, almost compromising his come-up. On “Everybody,” a solo track with a jubilant hook that sounds like it was written by or for Kamaiyah, he makes the simple prospect of hope sound wistful with a bare, pattering quip: “Look at me tryna get rich with everybody I know/But I probably can’t trust nobody I know.” That same paranoia washes over “One Two,” when Perico snaps: “Yeah I love you my nigga, but I don’t know if I can trust you my nigga.” With a droning hook and menacing economy to his detached narrative, Perico turns a song about a police raid and its aftereffects into something grimly mundane. On “Affiliated,” a stomping G-funk anthem with a bassline that sounds like it was pounded out on a janky living room piano, Perico injects the same depressingly shrugging perspective, finding a silver lining in his 10-toes-down ethics: “The G homie just took a dub/I know what you’re thinkin’ ‘Yeah that sounds super long’/But he comin’ home.” Music is a second act for Perico, who once just dabbled but is now doubling down on his reinvigorated rap career. He went to jail for the second time in 2012 on a gun charge, releasing an album on the day of his surrender. Ever since, he’s been pitching himself as a convincingly timeless and hyperlocal hero, burrowing deeper and deeper into the groove of a second chance.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/g-perico-2-tha-left/,So Way Out ,2017.0,"If you're a fan of the West Coast Hip Hop sound, then G Perico's latest album 2 Tha Left is definitely worth checking out. With a rating of 7.7 out of 10, G Perico has done a great job at delivering a solid album that showcases his unique style and sound.

Before diving into the album itself, it's worth noting that G Perico has been making music for a while. The Compton-based rapper has been in the game since 2011 and has released several albums over the years. What sets G Perico apart from some of his contemporaries is his ability to effortlessly blend vintage sounds with modern-day sensibilities. He's unapologetically West Coast, but he's not stuck in the past - his beats are fresh and his lyrics are relevant.

But let's talk about 2 Tha Left. According to G Perico, this album is something of a departure from his previous work. He's said that he wanted to experiment with different sounds, and he's definitely achieved that. From the opening track ""Affiliated"" to the closing track ""Bacc Forth"", G Perico takes us on a journey through his world. He's got plenty of bangers on this album - ""Everybody"", ""Mind Yours"", and ""Power"" - but he also shows his introspective side on tracks like ""What's Real"" and ""Late Night"". 

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Go"", which features the legendary Nipsey Hussle. The two Compton natives trade bars over a smooth beat that harks back to the G Funk era. It's a real treat for fans of classic West Coast Hip Hop, and it's clear that G Perico has a deep respect for the genre's history.

As someone who's been a fan of G Perico for a while, I'm definitely feeling this album. He's taking risks and experimenting with new sounds, but he's not losing sight of who he is as an artist. 2 Tha Left is a great album that's well worth your time. If you're a fan of West Coast Hip Hop, or just good music in general, I highly recommend giving this album a listen.","1.

Art Department,Social Experiment 003,"Electronic,Pop/R&B",7.3,March 7 2013,Tim Finney,Contributor,"""What do you think about at night?"" the anonymous narrator of John Tejada's electro-house anthem ""Sweat (on the Walls)"" asked dancefloors eight or so years ago. She already seemed to know the answer: House, with its sensuous rhythmic patterns and lustrous textures, is commonly described as a music of feel, of thoughtless submission, but even in the moment of seduction the dancer can watch him or herself getting lost in the music, observe, and perhaps feels a bit uneasy at their easy sacrifice of a bit of their humanity in the name of communal hedonism. Perhaps this sense of double-awareness is what the music itself thinks about at night: you can hear it in A Tale of Us' remix of Fuckpony's ""Bongo Porn"", the swirling delirium and compulsive jerking of the original ushered through unexpected minor-key passages of sadness, regret, even existential crisis, as if the groove is forever pivoting on that point where pornography might turn, almost imperceptibly, into a scene from Steve McQueen's Shame. The ""Bongo Porn"" remix lays bare most brutally the vibe which Canadian house duo Art Department stalk on this DJ mix, their first for their record label No. 19 Music's flagship series, and an unashamed extension of the sounds and emotions they explored on their 2011 album The Drawing Board. If, for the most part, Social Experiment 003 scales slightly lesser heights than the peaks reached on their debut (the epic ""Vampire Nightclub"", the by turns creepy and bittersweet ""ICU""), it also avoids that record's tendency towards heavy-handed overstatement, preferring a ""show, don't tell"" aesthetic of minor key melodies and densely layered rhythmic patterns (rather than dolorous Ian Curtis vocals) to get across the duo's persistent themes of desire, obsession, self-disgust, and fear of abandonment. The resulting sound feels neither modern nor particularly retro, although it's certainly arguable that the music's buffed up, high-gloss late night classicism resembles just a bit too strongly the kind of music that, say, Poker Flat label boss Steve Bug was playing nine years ago. Criticisms along these lines are true enough as far as they go, and Art Department will never win any awards for bravely conquering uncharted territory, but it would be unjust to ignore the dedication with which the duo strive to form a solid aesthetic around house's ambivalent hidden narrative of the dissolution of the self, going right back to Robert Owens' harrowing Chicago house classic ""Bring Down the Walls"". Fittingly (if somewhat obviously so) Owens offers guest vocals on two of the highlights here, starting with Art Department's own remix of Luca C. and Brigante's ""Tomorrow Can Wait"", all slithery Depeche Mode synth arpeggios and ceaseless house percussion over which Owens' anti-temporal hedonism emerges more as a quiet moan of dread. Jackin' Rabbit's ""Full of Dreams"" is even more existentially pregnant, using a bruised-sounding bassline and Owens' hypnotic murmurs to frame house music's escapism as a kind of prison of the mind. Appropriately, Art Department's sequencing is patient, frequently letting individual choices spin well past the five minute mark so as to underscore the sensation that these grooves are webs to trap dancers in. This approach works less well on the weaker cuts, where the music seems to simply spin its wheels with a clean-edged and mildly trippy but emotionless panache (see Ali Love's remix of Brigante's ""The Jungle"", or Art Department, BLUD, and Shaun Reeves' ""Robot Heart""), but pays off in spades on the warm but steely tech-house of the two final tracks, Gregorythme's ""Artificial Tears"" and Art Department's own ""Insomniac"", each running for close to eight minutes and offering up their own driving repetition as the only stable reference left in a world lost to doubt and uncertainty. Keep dancing? You've got no other choices left.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17734-art-department-social-experiment-003/,No. 19 Music,2013.0,"Art Department's 'Social Experiment 003' is a fascinating twist on modern electronic music, infused with pop and R&B stylings. The album is a departure from the band's previous work and showcases their versatility, proving that they are true masters of their craft.

Art Department is a Canadian electronic music duo consisting of Kenny Glasgow and Jonny White. The origins of the band date back to 2009 when Kenny Glasgow was a renowned solo producer and Jonny White was helping run one of the most influential clubs in Toronto, Circa Nightclub. The two quickly realized that they shared a passion for creating music that was both innovative and dance-worthy. They decided to join forces, and the rest is history.

Fast forward to today, and Art Department is on the third installment of their 'Social Experiment' series. The album is an impressive blend of diverse sounds and styles, showcasing the band's growth and maturity as artists.  What makes this album stand out is the band's ability to experiment with different musical elements, ranging from soulful R&B harmonies to edgy electronica beats.

The album's title, 'Social Experiment' hints at the direction the band was going for, as they attempted to capture some of the current conflicts and crises humanity is going through, and translate those into their music.

The album opens with 'The United in Divide,' a track that seems to explore the idea of unity in the face of societal fragmentation. It's a slow-burning intro that sets the mood for the rest of the album, with its futuristic soundscapes and soulful melodies.

My personal favorite track from the album is 'Paper Romance.' The track features the soulful vocals of Javeon, who adds a seductive touch to the electronic beat, creating a smooth and mellow feel. It's a track that highlights the band's versatility, as they manage to fuse powerfully emotive harmonies with futuristic, experimental instrumentals.

The album's closing number, 'On Your Mind' is another standout track. It's a haunting, melancholic electronic ballad, with a slow and melodic rhythm that compliments the deeply emotive lyrics. It's a beautiful closer that captures the essence of the album perfectly.

Overall, 'Social Experiment 003' is an impressive departure from Art Department's previous work. It's a bold and daring album, where the band explores different musical styles and elements effortlessly. It might not be their greatest work, but it is still a fascinating project that shows why Kenny Glasgow and Jonny White are among the leaders of the electronic music scene. If you are a fan of electronic music that blends soulful R&B harmonies with edgy electronica beats, then this album is definitely worth checking out.","1.

Miles Davis,Miles at the Fillmore - Miles Davis 1970: The Bootleg Series Vol. 3,Jazz,8.8,March 31 2014,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Miles Davis hated stasis. In the 30-year period between the time he first gained notice playing bebop with Charlie Parker to when he retired for five years in 1975, his music was usually in a state of transformation, with steady but noticeable changes occasionally interrupted by moments of what, in another context, paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called “punctuated equilibrium.” The shifts were not linear and could never be understood in terms of “progression.” Explorations into impressionist harmony, modal improvisation, pastoral sound-painting, neoclassical orchestration, abstract funk, and sheets of electronic noise weren’t experienced as one music building on top of another, but rather a constant search for the possibilities lurking in the unknown. As the years wore on, Miles’ own fear of irrelevance kept him working with players many years younger than himself so he was being exposed to new ideas without feeling the need to chase trends (most major jazz figures with an interest in experimentation made some overtures toward free jazz in the 1960s but Miles never did). All of which is to say that when you contemplate a single, narrow segment of Miles’ brilliant and varied career, there’s no telling what the music is going to give you until you immerse yourself in it. You have to look at where it came from and where it would go next. Miles at the Fillmore, the latest entry in Columbia’s revelatory bootleg series collecting unreleased Miles Davis live material, finds the trumpeter departing one musical world and entering a new one. In the previous five years, he’d taken the music of the Second Great Quintet (Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams) as far as it could go; hearing new music in his head, music that had never been made before, Miles fully embraced electric instruments on the dual landmarks In a Silent Way and, a year later, in April 1970, Bitches Brew; most of this set was recorded in June of that year. By this point in a very busy year of live performances, Bitches Brew was in stores and selling well and making waves, and Miles and his band were playing large rock venues, landing on the same bills as the Grateful Dead and Neil Young. Some of this material has been released in a different form. These four discs each contain an evening’s set, recorded on four consecutive nights in New York at the Fillmore East (live albums during this time can get confusing—Miles also recorded in April 1970 at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, and some of that material, in far poorer sound quality, is included as bonus tracks). On the 1970 2xLP Miles Davis at Fillmore, each night was condensed and edited by Teo Macero into an approximately 25-minute collage to fit a single album side and given an overarching title without identifying individual pieces (“Wednesday Miles”, “Thursday Miles”, etc.) That decision foreshadowed what was to come with Miles’ live sets through the rest of the 1970s, as written compositions and themes were considered only as additional elements to be swirled into process-oriented whole, and needn’t necessarily be identified. Compared to where his music would take in the ensuing four years, Miles’ sound in mid–1970 was still loosely tethered to jazz tradition. There are distinct compositions that unfold with a set arc, there are recognizable themes, there’s still a standard in regular rotation. And unlike his music in 1974 and ’75, Miles Davis’ trumpet is very much the focus, and his tone was strong and forceful and could easily cut through the electronic din. There are two keyboard players here, both of whom would go on to become hugely popular in the 1970s: Keith Jarrett (organ) and Chick Corea (electric piano). With no guitarist in the band, Jarrett and Corea are responsible for the electronics, and each plays his instrument in ways that go well beyond its intended use; Jarrett’s squawking solos are often harsh and noisy, reminiscent of electric guitar, while Corea’s electric piano gives the music a sense of disembodied drift. Dave Holland’s basslines are simple ostinatos but feel more connected to jazz proper than the minimal funk Michael Henderson would bring a short time later. Saxophonist Steve Grossman serves a more functional role, with solid workmanlike solos that mostly serve to make Miles’ time out front that much more exciting. And Jack DeJohnette’s drumming alternates between forward-driving and hard-hitting funk/rock and pure texture during more abstract passages. DeJohnette’s contributions underscore the defining quality of the music here: it’s relentless energy. The opener for each night, the Joe Zawinul composition “Directions”, sets the bar very high in this department. It’s built around a brilliantly simple bassline and has a classic theme that only shows up later in the piece, signaling when to pass the soloing baton to the next player. Miles would lose interest in this sort of structure over the next couple of years, but “Directions” is the perfect tune for him at this moment, and hearing the four show kick-offs in one place provides an opportunity to see how pieces varied from night to night. Wednesday night absolutely rips, as Holland’s bass refrain drives the song forward almost faster than the band wants to go. Thursday is comparatively mellow and exploratory, allowing for more space. On Friday DeJohnette takes a less polyrhythmic approach to drums and Miles is more fluid and less intense in his soloing. And then Saturday is lighter and trickier, with more quick rhythmic interplay. The set lists each night were almost identical—“The Mask”, “It’s About That Time”, “I Fall in Love Too Easily”, and “Bitches Brew” are all heard in multiple versions—but jumping to different takes from disc-to-disc never feels redundant, such is the invention and variation with each performance. Each phase of Miles Davis’ development calls for a different kind of listening. Both 1969 and 1970, to my ears, are more accessible than the late-period material with the second quintet, with its unusual harmonies and deceptive structure. Nefertiti from 1967 truly feels like a puzzle, something I’ll be working to understand forever, but the appeal of the Miles at the Fillmore material is obvious: This is an amazing band and they rip, but they never leave traditional ideas of rhythm and melody behind. There are extended soundscape passages in “Bitches Brew” and “The Mask” that are more about experiments in timbre, exploring how jazz improvisation can become the furthest-out space music possible, but the best of this set comes in hearing these players creating a new sound that remains immediate. You’re hearing jazz form straining against its enclosure, and soon enough, it would be abandoned—by 1974, another key era, musicality would not be a priority, as black-hole-level density took over completely. Any notion of mainstream acceptance was pretty much gone by then, and Miles and his band were doing brilliant things with that freedom. Here they’re doing equally brilliant things within certain strictures, making up a few rules and bending a few others to the breaking point.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19079-miles-davis-miles-at-the-fillmore-miles-davis-1970-the-bootleg-series-vol-3/,"Columbia,Legacy",2014.0,"Miles Davis is nothing short of a Jazz legend, and his album, ""Miles at the Fillmore - Miles Davis 1970: The Bootleg Series Vol. 3"" is a beautiful testament to his immense talent. This album is a compilation of recordings from four nights of performances in the Fillmore East in New York, during June 1970.

For those who don't know, The Fillmore was filled with rockers and music heads in the late 60s and early 70s. From the Grateful Dead to Jimi Hendrix, it was the spot to be. And in 1970, Miles Davis and his band brought their jazzy sound to this venue.

The band on this album is truly iconic. Dave Holland on bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums, Chick Corea on electric piano, and Steve Grossman on saxophone are all huge names in jazz. Together, they create an atmosphere that is both electrifying and mellow, with each musician playing off one another to create a cohesive sound.

What's amazing about this album is that it was never intended to be released. These recordings were bootlegs, rare copies passed between fans of Miles' work. But with ""Miles Davis 1970: The Bootleg Series Vol. 3,"" fans finally have a chance to hear these recordings in their raw and uncut form. 

As you listen, you'll be transported back to the 1970s, with the sound quality just enough to give you that vintage feel.

Various Artists,Ultra-High Frequencies: The Chicago Party,,7.5,March 6 2015,Barry Walters,Contributor,"Although it eventually revolutionized club music when house bubbled up from the black gay underground in the mid-'80s, Chicago couldn’t compete with Philadelphia, New York, or Miami when it came to disco. Aside from the city’s ballad-centric but occasionally fierce Chi-Lites and a few bandwagon-jumping old-timers like Gene Chandler, Chicago’s major contribution to disco’s history was also a key event in its destruction: Shock jock Steve Dahl staged Comiskey Park’s Disco Demolition Night, a baseball-promotion-turned-riot in the summer of 1979 often credited as the tipping point of the genre’s so-called death in the mainstream. But that doesn’t mean that Dahl convinced African Americans or any other minority to suddenly stop dancing. As lovingly and obsessively documented by Ultra High Frequencies, the Windy City helped stoke some of disco’s funkiest, most soulful flames. While DJ Frankie Knuckles mixed the ingredients for what would become house for a diverse crowd at the Warehouse, an equally idiosyncratic scene went down at the straighter but still quirky CopHerBox II. Launched in 1979 by trombonist Willie Woods and aspiring singer James Christopher, the publicity-hungry club hosted—along with assorted Miss CopHerBox pageants and Big Butt contests—its own TV program. Broadcast in 1982 on local UHF station WCIU, the original host of ""Soul Train"", ""The Chicago Party"" one-upped its famous competitor by not simply approximating a typical Saturday club evening: It documented exactly what went down on those nights at the CopHerBox for 23 episodes. Both the CD and double-vinyl editions of Ultra High Frequencies include a DVD featuring 23 musical performances, a brief documentary on the scene, and a 100-minute Chicago Party video mixtape. Between a swimsuit competition, circus-type contortions by the Phantom, James Brown-on-wheels splits via the Unknown Skater, android dance moves from CopHerBox regulars modeling the wares of designer Caroline Peeples, and the hosts’ own ""SNL""-inspired comedy hijinks, the mixtape overflows with highly entertaining shots of uninhibited adult couples shaking what their mamas gave them. No doubt these dancers were boogying down to bigger names—acts like D-Train, the Dazz Band, Evelyn King, Junior, Skyy, Shalamar, and other disco-funk stars of 1982. But because this compilation comes from the Chi-Town obscurities-focused Numero Group, their swiveling has been re-synced to vintage regional grooves, most of them so indie that they likely wouldn’t have gotten spins even in their home city. One exception was Yvonne Gage, whose smooth and sensual late '81 single ""Garden of Eve"" appeared on RFC Records, a major label affiliate that generated numerous anthems for New York’s Paradise Garage. Another was Magnum Force, a group that fused the sweaty bass-slapping stomps of Slave with the synth squiggles of the Time. They’re all over UHF: Their squishy slow jam ""Share My Love"" and brassy ""A Touch of Funk"" adorn the DVD, while the most anxious and libidinous cut, ""Girl You’re Too Cool"", brightens the album. All three would’ve charmed R&B radio had their sole LP, '82’s Share My Love, received national promotion. Much of the rest lack their polish, and the set’s most searing exceptions—male harmony quartet Closencounter’s violin-swept ""Without Your Love"", a pair of gospel-soul wailers from the female foursome Chicago’s Finest—appear only on the DVD because they most likely never got past the demo stage. Despite what crate-diggers hungry for proto-house obscurities may claim, disco was an emphatically hi-fi genre: A poorly recorded disc had to be otherwise good enough for most DJs to even temporarily compromise their equipment. ""The Chicago Party""’s low-budget local access charm enlivens the rawest tracks here, like Universal Togetherness Band’s urgent but nearly tone-deaf ""Pull Up"". The set’s catchiest track is Donnell Pitman’s ""Love Explosion""—six-plus minutes of music originally squeezed onto a tinny private-press seven-inch single. It repurposes Ripple’s ""The Beat Goes On and On"", a 1977 Salsoul Records disco classic, via an overdubbed alternate male lead melody. Like the rest, it’s hardly definitive, but resourceful and resolutely spirited, and the remastering here gives Pitman the sonic space he deserved. That familial energy lingers throughout. Hosts Woods and Christopher met while working for Model Cities, a government program that aimed to fight poverty while fostering inner city renewal and minority leadership. Ultra High Frequencies affirms that it was this spirit of communities taking care of their own that the duo brought to both their club and TV show. Despite the polyester-funk-meets-futurist-punk details that date stamp some fashions, most dancers are decked out in otherwise timeless, church-friendly threads that suggest how the era’s club scene brought a sense of the sacred into the secular world. ""The Chicago Party"" may have been fun-loving, even silly, but it serves as another fleeting example of disco’s ultimate spiritual purpose—elevation through togetherness.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20292-ultra-high-frequencies-the-chicago-party/,Numero Group,2015.0,"Have you ever stumbled upon a musical gem that completely takes you by surprise? If not, then let me introduce you to ""Ultra-High Frequencies: The Chicago Party"", a compilation album of the finest Nan music from the 1980s.

Let's dive into the history of the album. Back in the day, Chicago was known for its thriving underground party scene, which was fueled by the genre-bending sounds of the city's DJ's and producers. With a mission to capture the spirit of these parties, local label, Numero Group, compiled a collection of tracks from independent artists who were staples in the Chicago club scene during the 80s.

The result is a 21-track album that offers an immersive, sonic experience that seamlessly blends electro, funk, and soul. The album opens with The West Loop's ""Reach for the Sky,"" an upbeat and funky tune that sets the tone for the electrifying journey ahead. The album then switches up to some atmospheric, moody tracks like ""It's Alright"" by Sterling Void and ""Dream 2 Science"" by My Dream.

Personal stand-outs of mine include ""Jack The Groove"" by Ralphi Rosario and Xaviera Gold, with its infectious groove and dynamic bassline. Another highlight is Liz Torres' ""Can't Get Enough,"" which oozes old-school Chicago house vibes and catchy hooks that will be stuck in your head for days.

This album is a testament to the creative genius of Chicago's party scene during the '80s. Each track has a unique energy and vibe, showcasing the immense talent and creativity of each artist. It's hard not to feel the urge to get up and dance with every beat.

As a fan of electronic and dance music, I'll admit that I didn't know much about the Nan genre before discovering this album. But I can confidently say that ""Ultra-High Frequencies: The Chicago Party"" has opened my eyes to a new world of music that I'm eager to explore further.

Overall, I would give this album a solid 7.5 out of 10 rating. If you're a fan of the '80s, dance music, or just looking for something new and exciting to listen to, then do yourself a favor and give ""Ultra-High Frequencies: The Chicago Party"" a spin.

OMBRE,Believe You Me,,7.1,August 29 2012,Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,"If there's a common thread running through the music of Asthmatic Kitty labelmates Helado Negro, aka Roberto Lange, and Julianna Barwick, it's that both make records that sound like being alone in someone else's head. You could say this, of course, about a lot music and plenty of solo records in particular, but there's a certain embrace of tranquility, diffuseness, and acceptance of solitude that links their sensibilities. The nocturnal, Latin-tinged loops of Helado Negro's 2011 album Canta Lechuza (translation: owl singing), were pleasantly insomniac, like what you'd listen to after everyone else in the house has gone to sleep, knowing that's when your best ideas come. Same goes for the layered, wordless vocal wisps out of which Barwick composed the songs on her best and most recent LP, 2011's The Magic Place. Hovering somewhere between pop melodicism and ambient abstraction, Helado Negro and Barwick's music reimagines solitude not as a form of loneliness, but instead as something productive, joyful, quietly beatific. So what happens when two happy-go-lucky loners work together? We got an inkling of the answer late last year, when Lange offered up his take on Barwick's ""Vow"" for her decent, if superfluous, Matrimony Remixes EP. Moreso than Diplo & Lunice's relatively boilerplate remix of the same track, Lange's version kept something of Barwick's sensibility intact, favoring cumulous atmosphere over groove. A product of nearly two years of casually jamming together in his Brooklyn studio, Believe You Me, Lange and Barwick's debut record together as OMBRE, lives up to the promise of this remix, and in some cases even improves upon it. Because Barwick's style is so transparent, Believe You Me sounds, ostensibly, more like a Helado Negro record than one of her solo efforts: Lange's casually strummed upstrokes and thick, relaxed croon will sound familiar to any ears acquainted with Canta Lechuza. But closer listens reveal Barwick's contributions-- and her ameliorating affects on Lange's approach. Lechuza's fascination with blips and glitches was, occasionally, its downfall; Lange couldn't always work in his electro-tendencies without interrupting or detracting from the tracks' atmosphere. The addition of Barwick here actually subtracts elements from his sound, often to great effect. Her weightless backing vocals steer the zero-gravity Tropicália of ""Noche Brilla Pts. 1 and 2"", and add a celestial gloss to the loungey and gorgeous ""Weight Those Words"", which should be played on a loop in every hotel bar in heaven. Like any good abstractionist, Barwick says the name ""ombre"" came, simply, from some chance encounters with the word and a penchant for the way it sounds. But the word's meaning (think color gradient fabrics) fits the project-- and its occasional shortcomings as well. Though their sensibilities have a lot in common, certain particulars of Barwick and Lange's sounds are so different that the project sometimes feels like it lacks an overall cohesion. The Latin influence, for example, drops out in the second half, and after a few tracks on which Barwick's featherlight, wordless vocals take the lead, the complete disappearance of Lange's voice feels odd. Still, in its more blissful and transcendent moments (like the single ""Cara Falsa""), all earthly quibbles feel beside the point. Going back to the image conjured by the name ""ombre"", seamless cohesion-- or a blending of two colors into one completely new hue--doesn't seem to be the pair's goal. Instead, Believe You Me comes off as a collaboration between two dyed-in-the-wool daydreamers, finding both harmony and intriguing incongruity in their respective visions.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16965-believe-you-me/,Asthmatic Kitty,2012.0,"Believe You Me: An Ethereal Sonic Journey that Will Leave You Spellbound

OMBRE's latest release Believe You Me is a mesmerizing work of ambience and psychedelic experimentation. With a genre labeled as ""nan,"" the album delivers a unique sound that can only be described as a cosmic exploration of sound waves.

OMBRE, consisting of two musicians, Julianna Barwick and Helado Negro, are known for creating ethereal soundscapes and this album is no different. The band's haunting vocals seamlessly blend together with dreamy instrumentation, resulting in a whimsical sonic journey.

The creation story behind Believe You Me is interesting. The two musicians met a decade ago while on tour and decided to collaborate. However, their busy schedules prevented the production of the album for years. Finally, they found time to work together and that's when the magic began. The album was recorded in a remote cabin in upstate New York, where Barwick and Negro allowed their creative ideas to flow freely. Believe You Me is a testament to their perseverance and dedication to their craft.

The album opens with ""Weight Those Words,"" which hooks the listener with its hauntingly beautiful melody. The vocal layering creates a dreamlike quality, evoking a sense of otherworldliness.

""Tormentas"" is another standout track that showcases the band's ability to blend sound sculptures at such great depths. The harmonies are ethereal, and the track pushes the listener to mental and spiritual realms that will leave them spellbound.

Believe You Me comes with a similar palette of sounds, textures and harmonies, yet each track stands out and leaves its own unique impression. For instance, ""Cara Falsa"" incorporates an electronic riff that gives a futuristic feel, teasing listeners on the slow burn of the album as it reaches its climax.

The album concludes on a high note with ""Vistate,"" which encapsulates the sonic essence and theme of the album entirely. It’s a masterpiece that culminates with a pulsating beat and an infectious vocal hook that will triumphantly echo through your mind.

In conclusion, Believe You Me is a sonic journey that leaves an unforgettable impression. While the music genre may be labeled as ""nan,"" the album transcends conventional genres, leaving a lasting impression on the listener. OMBRE's dedication to their craft shines through in this album, and the outcome is nothing short of spectacular. This one comes highly recommended.","1.

Matthew Dear,Headcage EP,Electronic,6.8,January 19 2012,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"Matthew Dear's transformation, from bedroom techno polymath to live-band leader, occurred over such a long, seamless stretch that it's easy to take for granted just how surprising (and rewarding) it's been. In 2003, Dear's wonky vocal anthem, ""Dog Days"", could have been taken as a micro-house producer's novelty, a cheeky attempt at merging sappy indie pop with alien sound design. But while he kept on recording ""straight"" techno in a bewildering array of styles, Dear's records under his own name continued shucking dance music's rules, rhythmic and otherwise. Techno's precision kept his Afrobeat and art-funk fixations from devolving into jam-band aimlessness. And lessons learned from those genres made his machine textures appealingly strange, rather than preset bland. The four song Headcage EP both picks up where Dear's last record left off and shakes its influence enough to suggest where he might be headed next. Or maybe not. Like any good techno producer, Dear appreciates the EP as an artform in itself, rather than a way to rush out a set of not-too-dissimilar songs to keep fans happy between albums. That said, it might also be the least ""techno"" material Dear's recorded. Two of the songs verge on a kind of singer-songwriter's ambient, floating by with almost no backing at all. A third sounds like a sensitive rocker got hold of a Soulja Boy track and decided to make the best of it, with winning results. This is Dear as laid-back charmer, rather than forbidding electro architect. Compared to the dark (but not bleak) journey of 2010's Black City, where Dear transposed the ""nighttime drive"" claustrophobia of old-school techno to a set of intricate almost-rock jams, Headcage shakes off the late-night jitters for a sound so airy it threatens to evaporate into murmurs and empty space. *Black City'*s density suggested that Dear was drawing aesthetic energy from what most of us would just suffer as the stress of living in a tightly packed urban environment. Here he seems to be yearning for the room to chill. The dark electro of Headcage's title cut, vaguely reminiscent of various early-1980s British synth-pop bands without quite sounding like anyone specific, might inititally trick you into thinking the EP will be the afterparty to *Black City'*s bash. But Dear relaxes into something more comfortable and blissful as Headcage plays out, suggesting two possible routes for his music in the future. ""In the Middle (I Met You There)"" is one of the most surprising cuts Dear's put his name to since ""Dog Days"", a love song crooned (by the Drums' Jonny Pierce) over a bright hip-hop loop, not too dissimilar from the 8-bit fizz being peddled by producers like Clams Casino, that he fleshes out with shifting layers of keyboard buzz. It's as delightful-- chillwave with actual hooks and a sound rich enough to swim in instead of just wash over you-- as it is unexpected. But ""Street Song"" and ""Around a Fountain"" do away with anything as coarse as drums, unless a flicker of static repurposed as a rhythm counts, suggesting TV on the Radio at their most amorphous and then taking it even further. (Though given that Dear's always sung like this, it's an interesting question as to who got there first.) It's hard to imagine Dear constructing an entire LP out of such seemingly insubstantial stuff, but he might just be able to pull it off. Even in this beatless world, he brings his techno producer's instincts out, dropping just enough in the way of fleeting, right-place-right-time hooks to catch your ear when it's ready drift away from the song. It's a good example of how a grounding in ""functional"" dance would do a lot of avant-rockers a world of good.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16194-headcage-ep/,Ghostly,2012.0,"For the electronic genre fanatics, Matthew Dear needs no introduction. With a career spanning over 20 years, Dear's music has touched the hearts and souls of many. His latest album, ""Headcage EP,"" released on September 17, 2021, is no exception. The EP consists of six tracks, each with a unique twist that makes it stand out.

The first thing that struck me about the ""Headcage EP"" is how Dear has managed to maintain his signature style while still exploring new sounds. The EP is a sublime collage of modern electronic music, blending elements of techno, house, and avant-garde pop. The opener ""Muscle Beach"" is a perfect example of his versatility, with a driving rhythm that leads into a repetitive and hypnotic crescendo, capturing the essence of electronic music.

Dear has been immensely influenced by post-punk, and he brings that spirit to his music. His vocal delivery is fascinating, with a combination of spoken word and singing, which sounds like a conversation between the listener and the artist. The lyrics have a poetic quality to them, where words and phrases are repeated, creating a sense of tension and release. 

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Ad Hoc,"" which features a delightful interplay between the synths and percussion. The beat is catchy, and the melody is optimistic, making it one of the more accessible songs on the EP. 

The final track, ""New Breed,"" is a slow-burning ballad that showcases Dear's emotional range. The song builds up gradually, with a dreamy and ethereal wash of sound that adds to the poignancy of the lyrics. It's the perfect end to an album that consistently surprises and delights.

Dear credits the lockdown restrictions as the catalyst for writing and producing the album. The limitation of movement allowed him to introspect and explore new musical directions. He also drew inspiration from the emotional landscape of the pandemic, which is palpable on the EP.

In conclusion, ""Headcage EP"" is another remarkable addition to Matthew Dear's discography. The EP is a testament to Dear's artistry and his ability to push boundaries while staying true to his musical identity. The density of the album requires multiple listens to fully appreciate the depth of the tracks, but it is more than worth it. I give the album a rating of 8 out of 10. It's a must-listen for any electronic music enthusiast who appreciates innovation in the genre.","Step 1: Look for any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing

Jóhann Jóhannsson,The Miners' Hymns,Experimental,7.7,June 28 2011,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"Jóhann Jóhannsson's The Miners' Hymns is the instrumental soundtrack to Bill Morrison's dolefully spare documentary about the history of coal mining in northern England. As such, it will not make a stellar accompaniment to your next barbecue. Composed for brass ensemble, organ, and a light scrim of electronics, the album takes you places that are woefully ill-suited to early summer; it feels perfect for a grim, drizzly late autumn, when wet leaves are choking gutters and the air carries the threat of pneumonia. This might not be the most inviting sound world to contemplate, but Jóhannsson's confident touch with it is powerful, and The Miners' Hymns creeps into your consciousness like a musty attic draft. Jóhannsson builds the album's six pieces out of a series of low tones echoing faintly across a distance, like ships through fog. Extended periods of charged silence separate each burst. The structure is firmly ""EVENT-pause-EVENT""-- a meek cluster of sound, an evaporation of echoes, a blank band of dead space. The effect is like slipping pebbles in a pond, watching the ripples distort your reflection, and then waiting for the surface to clear. Jóhannsson's pacing with this material is patient unto funereal, and occasionally the music appears to be just hanging there. But train your focus on it, and you will sense the slowly darkening atmosphere. The lonely horn figure of ""Freedom From Want and Fear"", for example, gathers weight with each repetition, so that when it blares, halfway through the track, the contrast registers like a flash of heat lightning. The album was recorded in a Durham cathedral, and Jóhannsson has given the music a distinctly liturgical feel-- the descending bassline in ""There Is No Safe Side But the Side of Truth"" mimics the groaning sway of Renaissance sacred music. And when two sourly whining quarter tones give way to a gorgeously warm brass chorale in ""The Cause of Labour Is the Hope of the World"", the album's final track, it feels like an epiphany, a generous flooding of light that casts a backward glow on all the gloom and pallor that preceded it. Suddenly, the album's mood retroactively shifts. It's not a bleak autumn record; it's a halcyon autumn record, bathed in inviting half-light. I am reminded of playing basketball at dusk, and that imperceptible moment when you just can't see anymore and everyone reluctantly heads inside. It's a quietly exhilarating ""hallelujah"" that depends entirely on the previous 45 minutes of buildup for its weight, a nice reminder that some things are worth sticking it out for.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15578-the-miners-hymns/,Fat Cat,2011.0,"If there's one thing that's for sure, it's that Jóhann Jóhannsson is a master of experimental music. And his latest album, The Miners' Hymns, is no exception.

But before we dive into the music itself, let's take a brief moment to appreciate the band's history. Jóhannsson was born and raised in Iceland, and while he got his start composing for theatre and experimental art installations, it wasn't until the release of his first solo album, Englabörn, that he truly began to make waves in the music industry. And now, with The Miners' Hymns, he has once again proven that he is a force to be reckoned with.

The album was created as the score for a documentary film of the same name, which explores the history of the coal mining industry in the North East of England. From the very first note of the opening track, ""The Miners' Hymns,"" you can feel the weight of that history. The slow, mournful trumpet solo accompanied by ethereal choral harmonies sets the tone for the entire album.

But this isn't just a collection of mournful dirges. While tracks like ""An Injury to One is the Concern of All"" and ""Industrial and Provident, We Unite to Assist Each Other"" are undeniably sombre, they are also incredibly moving. Jóhannsson has managed to capture the pain of loss and the resilience of the human spirit in a way that few other artists can.

However, the album also has its moments of triumph. Tracks like ""The Cause of Labour is the Hope of the World"" and ""Freedom from Want and Fear"" are soaring and triumphant, and serve as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.

Of course, as with any experimental album, there are bound to be moments that are hard to swallow. The distorted noise of ""The Pit"" and the disorienting percussion of ""The Bath"" may be off-putting to some listeners. But for those who are willing to stick with it, the payoff is worth it.

Overall, The Miners' Hymns is a stunning work of art. It's an album that demands your attention and rewards careful listening. And while it may not be for everyone, for fans of experimental music, it's an absolute must-listen. I, for one, feel grateful to have experienced it.","1.

LCD Soundsystem,London Sessions,"Electronic,Rock",8.2,November 15 2010,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"For a group whose albums often seem like work of one studio-perfectionist mastermind, LCD Soundsystem have turned out to be one of the greatest live bands of the last decade. In fact, they do just about everything a great live band-- especially a great live dance band-- should do. Known to stretch their songs out to ""special disco version"" lengths, they're able to bring audiences from simmering anticipation to hands-up screaming release in the span of a song, and then do it again. And then again. Like Remain in Light-era Talking Heads, the closest comparison to LCD at their current ""locked-in but loose"" onstage peak, they could release a live album that might offer equal thrills to their studio discs. But London Sessions is not LCD's The Name of This Band is Talking Heads, and at least one reason why not is because live in-studio sessions like this one tend to capture artists in a slightly different mode than during a full-on concert, where a band can feed off the energy of thousands of sweat-soaked fans. The band mentions iconic BBC radio host John Peel's legendary program when talking about the album for a reason: Like those old Peel sessions, this set finds the band offering tighter, cleaner, more focused versions of their live staples, running through all nine songs with an electrifying, stripped-down effortlessness. Here, James Murphy proves that even without the thick, enveloping sound his production chops lent This Is Happening, he can match his heroes' delivery: His rare ability to snap from mordant humor to affecting pathos comes through loud and clear with back-to-back takes on ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"" and ""All My Friends"". But as great of a frontman as he is, LCD's shit-hot rhythm section, anchored by drummer Pat Mahoney and ex-!!! member Tyler Pope, nearly steals the spotlight. Their interplay is as mesmerizing to listen to here (especially those perfectly timed keyboard jolts that spike the intensity of ""Get Innocuous"" just a little higher each time) as it is to watch in person. And for a kinda-sorta disco band, they tear the roof off in a live-and-loud way. The sense of possible frenzy that lurks behind the slightly-too-hot ""metronomic"" groove of ""Us V Them"" builds to an edge-of-control climax that's even more thrilling than if the band had actually spun into a freakout. Of course, since these tracks aren't exactly radical live reconstructions, there aren't a ton of surprises on London Sessions. But it's still a wonder to hear a band this committed, this on its game, without the studio tweaks. Plus, you've got to consider what a debased format LCD is working with here. The number of actually transcendent live records-- whether recorded at a radio station or in an arena-- is almost laughably small considering how many exist. This one's a gift, the second LCD's given us this year.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14864-london-sessions/,"EMI,DFA",2010.0,"LCD Soundsystem's London Sessions: A Fusion of Electronic Grooves and Rock Energy

If you're a fan of danceable beats, driving guitars, and wavy electronic soundscapes, LCD Soundsystem's latest release, London Sessions, is definitely worth a spin. The Brooklyn-based band, fronted by enigmatic mastermind James Murphy, has been making waves in the indie scene since their debut in 2005, and this latest offering is a testament to their ever-evolving sound.

The album was recorded in just five days at London's legendary Electric Lady Studios, where legends like Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin have left their mark. This sense of history and tradition, mixed with LCD Soundsystem's cutting-edge approach to production, creates an exciting tension throughout the album.

The opening track, ""Dance Yrself Clean,"" sets the tone with its pulsating synths and darkly humorous lyrics, as Murphy sings about the existential dread of growing older while still feeling like a kid inside. The song builds to a euphoric climax, with shimmering guitars and cascading drums that make it impossible not to dance along.

The album's centerpiece is undoubtedly ""All My Friends,"" a six-and-a-half-minute epic that manages to be both melancholic and uplifting at the same time. Murphy's lyrics are a poignant reflection on the passage of time and the bonds of friendship, while the music swells and sways with a hypnotic rhythm that will stick with you long after the song fades out.

Other highlights include ""Pow Pow,"" a funky jam that channels the spirit of Talking Heads, and ""I Can Change,"" a bittersweet ballad that showcases Murphy's soulful vocals and penchant for heartfelt songwriting.

What sets London Sessions apart from LCD Soundsystem's previous albums is its raw energy and human touch. The band recorded most of the songs live, without overdubs or extensive editing, which gives the music a sense of immediacy and authenticity that is often lacking in modern electronic music.

As someone who has been following LCD Soundsystem's career for years, I can confidently say that this is one of their strongest releases yet. While they have always had a knack for crafting catchy hooks and witty lyrics, this album proves they are equally capable of delivering powerful emotional punches and transcendent sonic experiences.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of electronic music that doesn't sacrifice soul and emotion for the sake of slick production, or if you appreciate rock music that embraces the possibilities of technology and experimentation, then London Sessions is definitely worth your time. With its eclectic mix of styles, moods, and textures, it's an album that rewards repeated listens and invites you to dance, dream, and contemplate life's big questions all at once.","Step 1: Both reviews discuss LCD Soundsystem's London Sessions album.

Giraffage,No Reason EP,Electronic,7.3,November 26 2014,Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,"As prices for sample permissions have skyrocketed and the musicians whose work is being borrowed have become more litigious, producers are less willing to use sampling in their music. We’re seeing a lot of that in hip-hop, where producers from Kanye to El-P are simply making their own beats to imitate the sounds that they love, and in that way, avoiding the ire of the original creators. The development has also reverberated within the world of formerly sample-happy electronic music, where even big-name producers whose entire process was once screwing around with samples have begun to switch up their style. That’s certainly the case with Charlie Yin: the producer, working under the name Giraffage, was known most well for sampled beats like the one on last year’s thrilling Alpha Pup single, ""Close 2 Me"", and his remix of the entirety of The-Dream album Love Hate. Yin signed to Fool’s Gold this past June and promptly announced a new EP by releasing a remix of R. Kelly’s ""Ignition (Remix)"". But when the EP, No Reason, arrived last week it was accompanied by an interesting disclosure: the songs on it were written completely sample-free. That’s what Giraffage says, anyway. Listening to the EP, fans will notice a wealth of the same kind of tricks that Yin hooked them with in the first place. There are still plenty of vocals and sound effects present here: ""Hello"" kicks off the record with a screwed up version of the phrase: ""I just want to hear that we’re ok"" and those words echo throughout the track, set between the sound of iOS notifications, dial tones, static, and the lushest of synthesizers. When he talks about eschewing samples, Yin may just mean that he wrote all the instrumental music before adding borrowed sounds. But even if he recorded the other noises himself, their variety and interpolation contributes to the same sense of dynamism and depth that's always powered his music. Which is to say that, even if everything about his process has changed, not much about his music has. Which is good news: Giraffage excels at wringing a variety of feelings out of his tracks, using changes in register as an emotional dial. By changing how high or low a voice registers, he’s able to shift the way we understand what we’re hearing, as on ""Tell Me"", in which the title phrase is spun back and forth so that it’s made to sound like a dialogue between lovers. But even more important is what’s happening lower in the mix, where a wall of sound rears up, suffusing the listener in colored sonics so deep that the words become a small part of an enormous sensation. This kind of sudden eruption is typical of Giraffage; the producer's become a populist favorite as much because of his willingness to use traditional drops as his penchant for candy-colored R&B. ""Be With You"", the last and best song on the record, pulls the beat out several times only to reintroduce it with fringed, lightning-rod synths on top of it. Fans will recognize the instrumental; it’s the same one that was constructed around that R. Kelly remix, though it actually works better as a standalone. And maybe that’s really what Giraffage means when he talks about his new approach. His work with remixes and samples in general has always reflected a remarkable sense of depth, so much so that, if you were to pull out the original artist’s work, you would still be left with the sense of hearing a complete track. More than ever, the music he’s constructed on No Reason has the ability to stand on its own. But add the vocals and the ticks, the bleeps and the bloops, and you’ve got style in addition to that solidity. Those smaller elements make Yin who he is as a musician, and samples or no samples, here’s hoping he doesn’t abandon them anytime soon.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20026-giraffage-no-reason-ep/,Fool's Gold,2014.0,"It's always refreshing to see an artist continue to push the boundaries of their sound and explore new sonic territories. Such is the case with Giraffage and his latest release, the ""No Reason EP"". As someone who has followed the journey of this talented artist, I was eagerly awaiting this EP, and it's safe to say that it didn't disappoint.

Giraffage, also known as Charlie Yin, has been making waves in the electronic music scene since 2011. He first gained attention with his debut album ""Comfort"", which showcased his unique blend of dreamy, atmospheric beats with ethereal vocals. Since then, he has released several successful albums and EPs, collaborated with other artists, and been a staple in the international live music circuit.

The ""No Reason EP"" is an excellent addition to Giraffage's already impressive discography. The EP comprises five tracks, each of them showcasing the artist's signature style while simultaneously venturing into new territory. One of the most significant aspects of this album is how it maintains the consistency of Giraffage's sound while, at the same time, injecting fresh ideas and innovations.

The title track, ""No Reason"", resembles classic Giraffage, as it's layered with warm and dreamy synth pads. The song feels like a warm embrace; it's soothing, calming, and emotive. ""Basketball"" takes a more up-tempo approach, highlighting complex percussion and sampling techniques. It feels like the soundtrack to a summer basketball game, with its cheerful and bouncy rhythms.

My favorite track on the EP, ""Crash"", is simply stunning. It features a fragile and delicate melody that is intertwined with subtle, intricate beats. The emotion and vulnerability in this track are palpable and touch the listener in unimaginable ways.

Overall, Giraffage's ""No Reason EP"" is a beautifully crafted work of art. It takes the best aspects of his previous releases and adds a fresh perspective. The EP showcases his ability to create dreamy soundscapes, and at the same time, it highlights his growth and willingness to experiment with different sounds and arrangements.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of electronic music, dreamy soundscapes, and innovative sound design, then the ""No Reason EP"" is an absolute must-listen. It's an album that will pull you in and hold your attention until the finale, leaving you feeling rejuvenated and inspired. I commend Giraffage for his continued evolution and growth as an artist and am excited to see what the future holds for him.","1.

Dizzee Rascal,Showtime,Rap,8.6,September 7 2004,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"Ah, moaning about celebrity. Even when the complaints of the rich and famous are valid, they're still often insufferable. It's no surprise that films about the horrors of being chased by the paparazzi or how awful it is for poor Julia Roberts to sit through media junkets fall flat on their egos. And musically, negative responses to the klieg and camera lights haven't been much better. Tracks about the pitfalls of celebrity culture or the trappings of wide-scale admiration and fabulous wealth-- from Pink Floyd's ""Money"" to Pink's ""Don't Let Me Get Me""-- are often patronizing and grating. There are exceptions, of course: Eminem has been playing a compelling game of cat-and-mouse with his persona, fans and critics ever since he first hit the charts, and Kurt Cobain's wrestling with both self-hatred and a success he simultaneously courted and recoiled against are well explored on Nirvana's In Utero. When Dizzee Rascal was promoting his debut record, 2003's trenchant Boy in Da Corner, he famously cited In Utero as his favorite record of all time. Perhaps then it's no surprise that follow-up Showtime often deals with the London savant's fishbowl life as he negotiates both the expectations of those who hope he swims and the sharpened knives of those who wish he sinks. Rascal's level of fame isn't close to any of the above artists-- he thanks the 100,000 people who bought his debut, and he's still pleased just to open for Jay-Z rather than throwing rocks at Jigga's now-abdicated throne-- and that's part of his problem. ""Still Dylan the villain from around the way,"" Rascal is big enough that his detractors want to bring him down and small enough that they probably can. So while a multiplatinum seller like Nelly can wonder, ""What good is all the fame if you're not fucking the models?"", Dizzee is not only mercifully teased by a woman on Showtime's ""Face""-- she calls him a one-hit wonder and mocks his thin wardrobe and low-budget video before ultimately wishing a Jay-Z promo is on MTV Base-- but her words hurt. ""People are going to respect me if it kills you,"" Dizzee mutters on the follow-up track, and if that's the central goal on Showtime, he's likely to accomplish it. The album naturally lacks the shock of the new, the jolt of Boy in Da Corner-- instead, it's a consolidation of his strengths, lyrically and sonically, and a more satisfying listen than its predecessor. Musically, Rascal continues along many of the same paths-- explorations into orientalism and modal composition; the lurching, clattering futurerattle of jungle, dancehall, and hip-hop echoing through concrete tenements-- although the finished product is much more muscular and confident. Lyrically, he balances his paranoia with the spoonfuls of homespun advice and dew-eyed rallying cries that colored both his debut and Treddin' on Thin Ice, the solo bow from Wiley, another Roll Deep vet. In short, Rascal is keeping his feet on the ground, reaching for the stars, and looking over his shoulder for those who want to lay him in the gutter. Single ""Stand Up Tall"" has its finger on ""Pulse X"" and the exuberance and immediacy of Boy's ""Fix Up, Look Sharp"". ""Hype Talk"" ice dances with glitch-pop better than anything on Vespertine. ""Imagine"" takes fleeting elements of emo and the ""Girl/Boy Song"" to somehow magical results. ""Learn"" demonstrates that Rascal can do orientalism as beats-and-banger instead of just minimalist soundtracks to introspection. He also looks further afield to Jamaica (""Face"") and America (""Everywhere"", ""Flyin'""), and gets playful on the one-two combination of ""Dream"" and ""Girls"". The latter features the Kano-like cadence of Marga Man as he and Rascal wink and whistle at women over the track that sounds most like it could have tumbled off of Boy. The former is the song that will likely receive the most attention, and could be the make-or-break point for Showtime fencesitters. Taking its sing-song, Casio-tinkling chorus from Rodgers & Hammerstein via Captain Sensible's ""Happy Talk"", ""Dream"" is the record's most overt Jay-Z reference (it's a close cousin to ""Hard Knock Life"") and could become its commercial equivalent to ""Dry Your Eyes"", a recent UK #1 for The Streets. ""Dream"" has a loopy charm and simple philosophy, and Dizzee's infectious exuberance for the track leaves him unable to resist adding his off-key vocals to the central lyric: ""You've got to have a dream/ If you don't have a dream/ How you gonna have a dream come true?"" Even when something doesn't exactly work, there are other elements to buttress the missteps: ""Knock, Knock""'s central lyrical conceit is propped up by the track's tea-kettle sighs as it moves at night down Jefferson Avenue (it's much too slow for the Autobahn). The female vocal on ""Get By""'s chorus (which is more indebted to Kanye than the thug/diva duet template) has a bit of a square-peg/round-hole quality, but the song contains some of Dizzee's most quotable lyrics. ""If I can't find my around/ I'll find a way across/ And if I can't find my across/ I'll bore straight through,"" Dizzee insists on album closer, ""Fickle"". Not a Smiths reference (""fame, fame, fickle fame""), the track is perhaps the record's highlight, and the best example of Rascal's approach-- a mix of pragmatism and optimism, of demonstrating bravado without denying his vulnerability. Rascal's is a three-dimensional world, then-- not black and white, us vs. them, me against the world, me against the music, playas vs. hatas, underground vs. mainstream, or mo money, mo problems. There are elements of each of those cliches in his tracks, but he's smart enough to seek the nuances and contradictions in each of those supposed dichotomies rather than approach them as absolutes, an either/or, or a matter of right vs. wrong.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2346-showtime/,XL,2004.0,"Looking to satiate your hunger for some high-quality rap music? Look no further than Dizzee Rascal's newest release, ""Showtime."" This album is a solid addition to the ever-exploding genre and is a testament to Dizzee's skills as a rapper, beatmaker, and lyricist. As someone who has had rap music in my life for quite some time, I can safely say that ""Showtime"" is a well-done album that manages to hold its own against some of the greatest rap albums in recent history.

For those unaware, Dizzee Rascal's beginnings lie in the UK Garage scene, making his mark with his platinum-selling debut album ""Boy in da Corner."" Since then, he's been on a mission to prove himself as the cream of the crop in the world of rap, and his efforts have been...mixed, to say the least. However, with ""Showtime,"" Dizzee has managed to create a collection of tracks that showcase his best work in years.

The album is filled with hard-hitting beats and earworm hooks, which never cease to keep your attention. From ""Jus' a Rascal"" to ""Dream,"" there's a lot here to love. The album's title track, ""Showtime,"" is the highlight of the album, with a driving beat that will have you nodding your head along with the music in seconds. The song has an energy that could lift you out of a bad mood effortlessly.

But what ultimately sets ""Showtime"" apart is Dizzee's lyricism, as he manages to weave a story in each track that is both relatable and thought-provoking. With tracks like ""Stand Up Tall,"" Dizzee encourages listeners to stand up for themselves, while ""Stop Dat"" is an anthem for anyone who's ever dealt with a hater. It shows that Dizzee has a lot to say, and he's not afraid to say it.

Overall, ""Showtime"" is a solid addition to any rap fan's collection, and it's definitely worth a listen. While Dizzee Rascal may not be a household name in the US like some of his peers, he's proven that he has what it takes to compete with the best of them.

They're just in the business for the press junkets and free bookmarks shaped like giant squid, gavels, abducted babies, and other subjects of current bestsellers. But you can judge a book by its cover! A man with a beard swings from a helicopter shooting medieval knights: probably not a good book. 'By Harmony Korine': probably not a good book. Likewise, you can judge an album by its cover. Legendary rock critics Lester Bangs and Richard Meltzer admit to reviewing albums without a single listen. We at Pitchfork afford albums the luxury of being listened to, naturally. But still, after all this listening, as we sit before our keypads, we notice that, in most cases, all the clues to the album's quality had laid hidden in the packaging. With training, a critic can excavate a review by merely brushing the dust from the milky shards of information that poke through the soil of artwork and liner notes. Enon's Believo! serves as an adequate example. Perusing the band's 'thank you' list is convincing enough to warrant immediate purchase of this sparkly pop gem. ""Enon would like to thank: Les Savy Fav..."" Right off the bat, Enon thanks their closest musical brethren. Both Les Savy Fav and Enon hammer intelligent art-pop that juices familiar nuggets into fresh shakes. Les Savy Fav bark awkward/winning slogans over zealous future-punk. ""...Jenny Steube..."" In Danish, ""steube"" means ""very similar, yet opposite in one way,"" and ""jenny steube"" translates as ""vice versa."" Thus, by thanking Jenny Steube, coincidentally named after this Danish phrase, Enon specify their relation to Les Savy Fav. Les Savy Fav rule in the live environment, but their albums have yet to capture the dazzle that nearly frightens audience members, in that fun rollercoaster frightening way. Enon, on the other hand, have mastered the studio. ""...Robin Taylor..."" Robin shares a surname with tragically departed Brainiac singer Timmy. Enon mastermind John Schmersal played guitar for the greatly missed Brainiac, and his presence generated the obvious creative leap from the Pixies-ish Smack Bunny Baby to the facemelt of Bonsai Superstar. Believo! is an obvious sonic continuation from Brainiac's final release, the Electro Shock for President EP. The electronics-drenched, subdued pop of ""Flash Ram"" echoes in the whistle-along ""Get the Letter Out"" and the organ-driven ""Come Into."" Enon are also less afraid than Brainiac of venturing into simple pleasure and sheep's-clothing accessibility. Yet digital funk like ""Biofeedback"" carries the baton from Brainiac's latefound obsession with guitarless rock, like on Electro-Shock's ""The Turnover."" If anything, Enon are dipped deeper in silicon chips and flossed-out with discovered sounds. ""...Mendelsohn Electronics..."" Ah, yes. That would explain it. ""...GvsB..."" Girls Against Boys' Eli Janney connected the wires from Brainiac's brain to the studio. Enon's bass-heavy opening track, ""Rubber Car,"" takes GvsB's abstract sex-rock to new depths. The double bass noir of ""Cruel"" one-ups New Wet Kojak in the rain-slicked, red-lit cocktail lounge soundtrack department. The crackling in its background could be tube television static or fat taxi tires splashing through puddles. ""...Rick Rubin..."" This hints at the fist-pumping rock factor. As Rick Rubin had his hand in lots of hip-hop, so too does the title track pop along on wild junkyard funk. ""Conjugate the Verbs"" breaks into blissful riffs after a lovely interludes. ""Rubber Car"" thrusts robotic hips like Beck choreographing blacksmiths in an Audi plant. For Believo! brushes new textures against your ears. The production sounds of an ambiguous fidelity. Although lo-fi techniques and tools are utilized, they're piled in wanton abundance. In concert, Enon play from beaten antique suitcases crammed with jury-rigged appliances such as samplers, battery powered turntables, and chintzy Casios. ""...Drummer's World..."" Much of this invention comes from the manic mind of Rick Lee, former percussionist for Skeleton Key and Butter 08, a man who builds kits from wagons and hubcaps. His garbage-drumming is heard throughout Believo!. ""For the Sum of It"" tumbles along cartoon jungle jazz breaks. The result of these three wonderfully demented minds blossoms into surreal structures. Although the molds are familiar, the filling certainly isn't. Much like a brick house made of ham. A house made of ham bricks. (""...Debbie Hambrick..."") ""...D8N OH10..."" Who would have thought this little city off I-75 could play to womb to such essential pop? For an much as Enon obviously owes to Brainiac, there is equally as much Breeders powerglee and Guided by Voices two-minute hook factory. What's exciting is not so much the overwhelming success of this debut, but the notion that Enon still squiggle in their larval state.

Tujiko Noriko,Solo,Electronic,7.7,September 14 2007,Roque Strew,,"Tujiko Noriko's songs have an origami-like quality: cute and delicate, with a sense of flatness given shape. After hopping from label to label, and dabbling in filmmaking, she has come to Editions Mego, the reconfigured version of the Viennese label that released her gorgeous 2001 album Shojo Toshi, to put out the aptly titled Solo. Mellower than her past two Mego releases, her new record finds Noriko going it alone, contorting the level planes of pop with her mobile, avant-garde imagination. Sounding like a patchwork of radio static, outdoor sounds, snippets of recorded strums, and the naked human voice, her music might be captured transmissions from the id, an amalgam of airwave junk reconstituted as art. Earthly nature sneaks in: The synthesizers approximate birds chirping and insects skittering (""Sun!""), burps and bowel movements (""Gift""). Add the warm rushes of melody, and you have Noriko's brand of Rabelaisian science fiction for the ears: a warble that softly grades into a dirty, otherworldly terrain. Not that the city lights of her native Japan and adopted France, past and present, don't spill through the haze. There's a sultry, moonlit glimmer to ""Spot"" that would fit nicely inside French chanson, but that's it for one-to-one parallels. When asked by Japanese magazine Shift how Paris has shaped her music, Noriko free-associated a better answer: ""Desolation, lassitude, reactionary."" Copyrighted, potentially, as Mitt Romney's campaign slogan, the three enigmatic nouns capture the breeze of post-riot, Chirac-era pessimism blowing through her album's happy textures. If France imparts mood, Japan lends order. Unlike Björk, whose glacier-shattering contralto tends to tyrannize her tracks, Noriko's humbler voice melts discreetly into a democracy of sound. Both women use their voices as instruments, but Noriko views her own merely as one among many: first among equals. So, you might say, she shares more with her fellow Japanese artists, the generation that includes Sachiko M, the onkyo queen of texture, ambient idol Miharu Sochi, and After Dinner's Haco, the rock star turned sound bricoleur. There is a healthy amount of disorder, too: As Noriko's fans would expect, Solo avoids the schematic here-to-there, beeline routes of Japanese pop. ""Spot"" may come the closest. Flickering inside these songs are the surreal motions of mental wanderlust, a weighty randomness that suggests the dislocations and spasms of reverie. Like the paper crane, like a dream, the wonders of Solo are rooted in metamorphosis. By turns tender and abstract, tracks like ""Ending Kiss"" (where she teams up with Hideki Ataka) and ""In a Chinese Restaurant"" seem to endlessly outpace expectations. They begin roughly as ballads, before off-time drums, thundering like distant artillery, rattle the pop scaffolding loose. We try to predict the next twist, how Noriko will dynamite whatever ornate façade she's been hand-crafting carefully before us. With the opening track's overlapping evolutions-- from whispery sing-speak into delicate coos into multitracked echoes, from clicks and knocks into shakers and rewound samples-- we should have been prepared for the zigzagged road ahead. Noriko is too inventive, too capricious, or simply too short on concentration, for our sluggish brains to catch up.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10612-solo/,Editions Mego,2007.0,"If you're looking for an electronic sound that will transport you to another world, then Tujiko Noriko's newest album, Solo, might be just what you need. With a rating of 7.7 out of 10, this album hits all the right notes when it comes to electronic music, and Noriko's unique style is something to be marveled at.

Tujiko Noriko has been active in the music industry for over two decades, influencing a generation of musicians with her innovative sound. With Solo, she continues to push the boundaries of electronic music and explores different soundscapes that take the listener on a journey of self-discovery.

The album opens with the track ""Fukushima,"" which immediately sets the tone for the rest of the album. This song, which is named after the site of the tragic nuclear disaster in Japan, is a slow and melancholic piece that is both haunting and beautiful. It showcases Noriko's unique ability to blend different elements of electronic music into a cohesive whole, and as the album progresses, you're taken on a journey through different moods and styles of electronic music.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Dark Past,"" which features Noriko's haunting vocals over a mesmerizing soundscape. The lyrics speak of the struggles of dealing with the past, and the song's somber tone perfectly captures the raw emotions of the lyrics. It's a track that will stay with you long after you've finished listening to the album.

Another highlight of the album is ""Metronome,"" which features a captivating beat that will make you want to get up and dance. It's a fun, upbeat track that shows Noriko's versatility as an artist. The album closes with the track ""U,"" which brings the listener full circle back to the somber, introspective mood of the opening track.

Overall, Solo is a masterful piece of electronic music that showcases Tujiko Noriko's incredible talent. Her unique style is both enchanting and mesmerizing, and her ability to convey emotions through her music is simply unparalleled. Whether you're a fan of electronic music or not, Solo is an album that deserves to be heard. So go ahead, give it a listen – you won't regret it.","1.

Arab Strap,The Last Romance,Rock,8.0,October 18 2005,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"For the men of Arab Strap, the concept of romance has always been a favorite joke. Over the course of their discography, Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton have explored romance as an abstract notion constructed of the sordid lies people tell in order to pair off and-- as Aidan put it in one variation-- ""go home and make a mess."" On The Last Romance, their sixth proper studio album, Arab Strap present another song cycle detailing the craggy terrain that separates gloriously tawdry, dead-end sex from more lasting, mature (i.e. boring) relationships. But this time something wholly unexpected occurs, as the duo's notorious self-deprecating gloom here begins to lift, allowing the briefest rays of romantic comfort and satisfaction to flicker in the distance. Throughout The Last Romance, Arab Strap's more familiar lyrical themes are thankfully bolstered by their boldest and most assured music to date, as they build confidently on the advances made on 2003's Monday at the Hug & Pint. Gone entirely are their once-frequent plunky drum machines, replaced by a skillfully balanced array of piano, strings, and horns. And though as a vocalist Moffat remains his curmudgeonly limited self, never before have his vocals been so thoughtfully integrated into Middleton's arrangements-- check the way his croon expertly mirrors the cello on ""Confessions of a Big Brother""-- giving these performances an effortless, dyed-in-wool cohesion that their earlier pint-fuelled narratives sometimes lacked. Over the years, Arab Strap have recorded an astonishing number of songs set in beds with dirty sheets, so the sleazy jolt of ""Stink"" opens The Last Romance in well-established territory, and with Moffat's customary disinterest in foreplay. ""Strangers waking up in the Monday morning stink/ Of course I feel sick, but it's not why you think,"" he sings over formidably roiling guitars, postponing for a moment the album's newfound streak of tenderness. Equally uneasy are tracks like the propulsive ""(If There's) No Hope For Us"" and ""Chat in Amsterdam, Winter 2003"", a heartsick, drumless mutter which eventually opens out into impressively dissonant smears of guitar while Moffat glumly intones, ""If we're having so much fun than how come I'm crying every Monday?/ Is it just to cancel out the laughter from Thursday 'til Sunday?"" It's on the aforementioned ""Confessions of a Big Brother"" that The Last Romance takes a deliberate turn, as Moffat begins to dole out the do-as-I-say-not-as-I've-done advice like a pub-bound St. Augustine: ""Try and be a gentleman, always tell the truth/ I'm not just a hypocrite, I'm jealous of your youth."" Evidently taking this solemn, introspective counsel to heart, the duo move promptly through some of the most warm-hearted material in their history, starting with the affectionate pillow talk of ""Come Round and Love Me"" (""It's on the tips of our tongues, but who'll be the first one to say it?"") and the wry, pro-monogamy pummel of ""Speed Date"". On the piano-driven ""Dream Sequence"", the album's lead single, Arab Strap-- to their everlasting chagrin, no doubt-- even approach something of Coldplay's atmospheric sweep, although Chris Martin has certainly never demonstrated Aidan's overall ability to use the word ""fuck"" with such invention. Later, as the raucous, album-closing ""There Is No Ending"", achieves a brassy, Pogues-like swell, Moffat comes to identify romance as a curious, but welcome form of surrender: ""If you can love my growing gut, my rotten teeth and graying hair/ Then I can guarantee I'll do the same as long as you can bear."" And though such optimistic sentiments might initially sound jarring to those familiar with Moffat's cultivated persona as the surly bard of hungover, carnal ennui, The Last Romance should stand as proof that a little sunlight might just do Arab Strap some good.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/275-the-last-romance/,Chemikal Underground,2005.0,"It's not every day that you come across a band like Arab Strap. They've been around for over two decades now, and their sound has evolved so much over the years, yet they've never lost sight of what makes them so unique in the world of rock music. Their latest album, 'The Last Romance', shows them at their best yet again, with a rating of 8.0 out of 10.

For those who may not be familiar, Arab Strap is a Scottish band that was formed in 1995. They're made up of Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton, and their music is known for its raw emotion and honesty. They've always been a bit of an enigma in the world of music, with their sound being difficult to categorize. The best way to describe it would be a mix of post-rock, indie, and electronic.

'The Last Romance' is the band's seventh studio album. According to interviews, the album was made during the pandemic, with Moffat and Middleton exchanging ideas and demos over email. The end result is a testament to their ability to create powerful music, even in the most trying of circumstances.

One thing that stands out about the album is how honest and vulnerable the lyrics are. Moffat's voice is like a knife, cutting deep into your emotions with lines like ""I don't know what to do with myself, sometimes I think I should just crawl back into bed and stay there for a year or so."" The songs deal with themes like loneliness, regret, and the passage of time, and they do so with a depth and nuance that is truly impressive.

As a fan of Arab Strap for many years, I was excited to hear this album, and I have to say, it did not disappoint. From the opening track, ""The Turning of Our Bones,"" to the closing song, ""There Is No Ending,"" the album is a journey that is both exhilarating and emotional. Some of my personal highlights include ""Sleeper,"" which is a haunting track that builds to a powerful climax, and ""Kebabylon,"" which has a groove that is impossible to resist.

Overall, 'The Last Romance' is a triumph for Arab Strap. It's an album that showcases their skill as musicians and their ability to tap into the most profound human emotions. If you're a fan of rock music, or just appreciate powerful songwriting, then this is an album you need to hear.","1.

Valet,Nature,Electronic,7.1,May 28 2015,Aaron Leitko,Contributor,"Initially a solo project for Portland-based musician Honey Owens, Valet explored territory that was not far afield from the singer's work in spooky, experimental-minded groups like Jackie-O Motherfucker. The project released two full-lengths on venerable zone-out institution, Kranky, and also an EP on Mexican Summer before disappearing from view in the late 2000s. Since 2010, Owens and her partner, Rafael Fauria, have focused on creating hardware-driven psychedelic house music under the name Miracles Club, releasing a number of EPs on labels like Ecstasy and Mexican Summer. However, following the birth of their first child in 2013, the pair felt compelled to temporarily step away from club sounds. Rather than release the resulting mellower guitar-driven music as Miracles Club, Owens decided to resurrect Valet, only this time as a group, featuring Fauria and multi-instrumentalist Mark Burden. The result is Nature, Valet’s first record in seven years. A lot has changed. Previous Valet albums were song-driven, but much more abstract in their execution. The music was centered on Owens’ voice, but also readily wandered into extended space-outs—abstract doodles, warped guitar leads, and repetitive psychedelic loops. The music was gentle, but the improvisational disorder conveyed a certain amount of menace and discomfort. Nature is more focused and more serene. Both the melodic content and production style suggest that Owens and Fauria have been revisiting '90s psych and space-rock staples like Slowdive, Spiritualized, and the Verve (A Storm in Heaven-era Verve, at least). Those bands relied heavily on studio time and technology to generate a distinctively gauzy vibe—leaning heavily on reverb, delay, and lots of guitar overdubs. On Nature, Valet turns to similar sounds, but on a stricter budget. Much like Kranky-era Deerhunter and Atlas Sound (Owens was a touring member of that band), the group uses readily available resources—foot pedals, computer-based recording software, digital plug-ins—to dial in otherworldly ambience. It sounds DIY, but in a way that strengthens the record’s character and allows some distance from its influences. What really separates this most recent incarnation of Valet from the shoegaze records of yesteryear, though, is the songwriting. Old-school space rock bands were very concerned with transcending or escaping one’s physical self—revisit Ride’s ""Leave Them All Behind"", the Verve’s ""Slide Away"", or just about any Spiritualized song. On Nature, Owens’ lyrics tend to involve memory and personal upheaval, rather than altered states. ""Twelve different ways to put up a fight/ Upside down police cars under fire bridges,"" she sings on the record’s title track, which alternately recalls experiences with civil unrest, 40s, and LSD. For such a trippy, reverb-drenched, and ethereal set of songs, Nature is surprisingly intimate and reflective. Nature does deliver the psych-rock goods, though. The trio’s songs impart a feeling of ascension—with murky atmosphere giving way to nodding repetition and guitar-driven uplift. Like their peers and forebears, Valet create simple music that feels expansive. Only here, the swirl of fuzz and echo isn't an exit from terrestrial woes, just a comfortable place to take stock for a moment.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20614-nature/,Kranky,2015.0,"The electronic music scene is constantly evolving, and Valet's latest album, ""Nature"", is a testament to the genre's diversity. With a rating of 7.1 out of 10, this album is a must-listen for fans of electronic music.

Valet, the solo project of Portland-based artist Honey Owens, has been around since the mid-2000s. Owens has established herself as a consistent and prolific producer, with over a dozen releases under the Valet name. As Owens explains, you can't talk about ""Nature"" without talking about ""This World Is Sick"", her previous release. ""This World Is Sick"" was a reflection of the chaos and darkness in Owens' personal life, and ""Nature"" is the balm that came next. It's a meditation on the natural world, harnessing the healing properties of sound and melody for a calming and soothing effect.

From the opening track ""Nature"", the album takes you on a surreal journey through the landscape of the mind. The sounds are organic and pure, like the rustle of leaves or the chirping of birds. But they are also heavily processed and augmented with electronic effects, creating a unique fusion of natural and supernatural. It's like being in a garden at midnight, where plants and flowers are illuminated by the moon and stars, and there's a sense of magic in the air.

Standout tracks on the album include ""Tides"", with its shimmering arpeggios and haunting vocals, and ""Plateau"", which builds to a crescendo of distortion and chaos before descending into a gentle reprise. But the whole album is a cohesive and immersive experience, with each track flowing seamlessly into the next.

For me, ""Nature"" is an album that captures the beauty and wonder of the natural world, but also reminds us of its fragility and vulnerability. It's a timely reminder that we need to protect our planet and take care of the environment around us. But it's also an album that offers hope and healing, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is still beauty and wonder all around us.

Overall, I highly recommend ""Nature"" to anyone who loves electronic music or who is looking for a soothing and calming listening experience. It's a gorgeous and thought-provoking album that will stay with you long after the final note has faded away.","Step 1: Review A starts with an overview of Honey Owens and her music projects, Valet and Miracles Club, and then talks about the formation of the current Valet group and the release of ""Nature"".

The Acorn,No Ghost,Rock,6.3,September 10 2010,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"The Acorn's No Ghost is a curious example of what happens when a band has everything going for it but a compelling, original voice. The songs are inventively arranged, exuberantly played, and occasionally beautiful. There are moments of disarming simplicity-- the sparse, shimmering ballad ""Misplaced""; the dusty banjo plonking of ""Slippery When Wet""-- and moments of high color and energy, like the title track, built on a needling bed of guitar harmonics and some sawing violins. Like two clear precursors, Grizzly Bear and Califone, the Acorn have a knack for accretion of tiny, engaging details: marimbas, horns, organs, and other colorful elements will often slip fluidly into the background halfway through a song, adding warmth, texture and atmosphere on an almost subconscious level. And yet, somehow, almost none of No Ghost manages to leave a lasting impression. Why? It's a puzzling question, and it hovers over a lot of talented bands dogged by a certain hard-to-define facelessness. A unique voice is a difficult thing to talk about, since no two people can agree on what one is, exactly. The Acorn's sound is indistinct; they make pleasant, full-bodied folk rock, but their sound has a wobbly center of gravity. When they adopt the rangy slide guitar and scrap-yard percussion of Califone, like on ""I Made the Law"" and ""Almanac"", there isn't enough Acorn there to keep from the overwhelming sensation that a Califone album has unexpectedly wandered into view. Rolf Klausener's clear, high tenor even resembles Califone frontman Tim Rutili's, but without any of the ear-catching crags or world-weariness. His voice is pretty but polite; when he hits high notes on the uptempo numbers, like ""Restoration"" or ""Bobcat Goldwraith"", there is a pinched quality to it that squashes the momentum. There are glimmers, in the various half-ideas that surface throughout No Ghost, of a vision that the band could have taken and run with. Klausener's lyrics can be appealingly morbid. It doesn't immediately register, for instance, that the opening lines of ""Restoration""-- ""concentric circles signal dinnertime""-- refers to chumming sharks. They have a good feel for ballads. On songs like ""On the Line"", the Acorn sound more relaxed than on the uptempo rockers, which betray a whiff of overachievers' strain. The album's most indelible moment is the sweet, subdued ""Slippery When Wet"". The pace slows, the arrangement opens up, and a simple, instantly affecting tune rises out of the silence. It is a humble, quiet moment, but the band sounds more at home in it than anywhere else on the album.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14603-no-ghost/,"Bella Union,Paper Bag",2010.0,"The Acorns' latest album, ""No Ghost,"" is a rock masterpiece that showcases the band's unmatched talent and creativity.

For those who may not know, The Acorn hails from Canada and has been in the music scene for quite some time. With this latest release, ""No Ghost,"" they have proven why they are still relevant and deserving of our attention. The album is a collection of eleven tracks that'll take you on a musical journey through creativity and sheer genius.

Each song stands on its own but is also part of a greater whole, a testament to the band's skill in crafting an album that deserves to be listened to from start to finish.

The songs themselves are lyrically rich, with deep themes that are sure to resonate with listeners. They touch on subjects that are relevant and relatable, like love, loss, and the human condition, all while maintaining the rocking beat and energy that's so characteristic of the genre.

As someone who's been a fan of The Acorn for a while, I can say that this album is different from the others they've released.

Up With Chains!,Rock,6.7,May 12 2009,Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,"Ian Svenonius has been working his ironic-not-ironic far-left rock'n'roll intellectual persona for more than 20 years now, and at this point, it is very hard to imagine that he ever breaks character. Whether he is fronting one of his many bands, penning provocative essays, or interviewing other musicians on his internet talk show, Svenonius is fully committed to a distinct personal aesthetic that he developed as the singer of the Nation of Ulysses that essentially boils down to a stylistic and philosophical marriage of groovy 1960s radicalism and late-80s indie-punk ethos. It's an affectation for sure, but even at his silliest extremes, it is abundantly clear that Svenonius fully believes in his rhetoric, and that it's not just some elaborate joke at the expense of old-school hipster intelligentsia. If anything, it has become clear that his performance is inherently confrontational in the way it forces cynical, complacent audiences to reckon with idealistic discontent and unapologetic goofiness, and nudges them to wonder how and why it became so uncool to mix pleasure and politics. Chain and the Gang, Svenonius' latest band, does not stray far from the sound of his previous work, though it does mostly jettison the hard psychedelic style of his Weird War project. As the name of the group implies, he has integrated some elements of prison blues, but the funky playfulness of the music mostly recalls his late-90s material as the frontman of the Make-Up. This is a welcome return to form-- though Weird War had a number of great songs, too many of their recordings felt stuffy and overbearing, and Svenonius' slinky, highly expressive voice is flattered by compositions with ample negative space. The grooves on Down With Liberty... Up With Chains! are about as loose as a band can get without being remotely sloppy, and the result is an album that emphasizes a sense of levity that has always been present in his work, but had never been quite as dominant as in this set of songs. Though Svenonius takes on some heavy topics throughout the record-- at one point, he's calling out for reparations!-- the politics of Chain and the Gang are primarily focused on matters of lifestyle and personal conduct. This is most evident on ""Trash Talk"", a rant against the omnipresence of snarkiness that owes more to the humanity and humor of Sly and the Family Stone than the clueless prissiness of anti-snark critic David Denby. It also comes through in the cheerful party rocker ""Room 19"", and in ""Unpronounceable Name"", a swinging, jazzy delight in which Svenonius plays the role of a romantic lead in pursuit of a woman with a name so difficult to say that she becomes entirely elusive and nearly mythical. Not all of the songs are gems-- the relatively dirge-like ""Deathbed Confession"" overstays its welcome by a few minutes, and the deliberately primitive ""(Lookin' For a) Cavegirl"" is rather tedious even before its first minute is through-- but otherwise the quality control is rather high, and the result may be Svenonius' best overall LP since the Make-Up's Save Yourself was released a decade ago.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13022-down-with-liberty-up-with-chains/,K,2009.0,"When I first heard about Chain and the Gang's latest album, 'Down With Liberty... Up With Chains!', I wasn't quite sure what to expect. With a name like that, and a band known for its avant-garde approach to rock, I braced myself for what could be a wildly unique listening experience.

Chain and the Gang has been around for more than a decade, since its formation in Washington D.C. by lead singer and guitarist Ian Svenonius, who was previously involved with other influential punk bands such as Nation of Ulysses and The Make-Up. With a name referencing both the necessity of being ""chained"" to the struggles of working-class life and the liberation that can come from setting oneself free from the chains of oppression, Chain and the Gang's music is as political as it is danceable.

'Down With Liberty... Up With Chains!' is the band's fifth full-length album, and it was recorded in the midst of a pandemic that has upended our lives and the world as we know it. The album's genesis is fascinating, as it was originally intended to be a live recording from a concert in Brussels that the band played in November 2019. But as the pandemic hit, the band was forced to cancel its tour, and instead, Svenonius morphed the Brussels recordings into a studio album.

The resulting sound is a mix of post-punk, funk, and soul, with nods to rockabilly, garage rock, and even some spoken word. Svenonius's lyrics are as biting and witty as ever, calling out political hypocrites and the insidiousness of capitalism with his trademark sardonic humor. The album's opener, ""Introduction,"" sets the tone for what's to come, with a spoken-word monologue delivered in Svenonius's deadpan, theatrical style that lays out the album's anti-capitalist message.

But there are also moments of pure joy on this album. ""Rome Wasn't Burnt In A Day"" is a funky, dance-worthy track that pays tribute to the revolutionary spirit of Rome's Gladiators. ""Deathbed Confession"" is a ballad that's as earnest as it is chintzy, with Svenonius crooning, ""I've got a deathbed confession, I never told you how much I love you."" ""I See Progress"" is another optimistic track that celebrates progress and change, with a chorus that's sure to stick in your head.

Overall, 'Down With Liberty... Up With Chains!' is a solid addition to Chain and the Gang's discography. While it may not be their best album to date, it's got plenty of standout tracks that are sure to get stuck in your head. Svenonius's political message is as relevant as ever, and his ability to blend humor and social commentary is on full display here. If you're a fan of post-punk or rock with a political edge, this album is definitely worth a listen.","Step 1: Review A uses more complex language and sentence structure, with longer paragraphs and more specific references to the artist's previous work.

Fucked Up,The Chemistry of Common Life,Metal,8.8,October 16 2008,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Whether it's their second release or their 60th (no one's even pretending to be sure), Fucked Up's The Chemistry of Common Life is really easy to get excited about. A lot's been made about how it could possibly revitalize hardcore, although framing it within genre terms tends to lead to the wrong questions: Is it too melodic and instrumentally diverse to qualify as hardcore? Maybe. Is it heavy and chaotic enough to satisfy fans of the debut, even while it dramatically broadens their fanbase? Possibly. Can a band as destructive as Fucked Up really carry an entire scene on their sweaty, unshaven backs? Stranger things have happened. It might seem counterintuitive to call Chemistry a grower: From the first listen, it's both pummeling and riveting. When frontman Pink Eyes (Damien Abraham) makes his grand entrance 1.5 minutes into the massive album opener ""Son the Father"", he channels G.G. Allin by way of Les Savy Fav's Tim Harrington, delivering fiercely intelligent lyrics in a singing voice presumably treated by years of guzzling Canadian Club and then eating the bottles. That said, The Chemistry of Common Life is a guitarist's album: 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk) and producer Jon Drew balance classic rock force with shimmering overdubs, at times recalling the Smashing Pumpkins, while at others echoing the layered, chiming guitars and famed loud/quiet dynamics of Bossanova-era Pixies. First single ""No Epiphany"" has 18 overdubs alone. Fractured harmonies bring ""Crooked Head"" to its cruising altitude, while breakneck opener ""Son the Father"" is almost tactile in its texture, with power chords and rich overtones busting into an arm-swingng chorus that doubles as the record's thesis: ""It's hard enough being born in the first place/ Who would ever want to be born again?"" It's a hell of a pace to sustain, particularly after the bongo-laced battering ram ""Magic Word"", but Fucked Up get plenty of help: Chemistry is an ""it takes a nation of millions"" endeavor, born out of a sense of community and the determination to create something huge. According to the band, something along the lines of 70 tracks of instruments went into the making, as well as guest vocals from Vivian Girls and Sebastian Grainger (formerly from Death From Above 1979). It's not a situation where Fucked Up are seeking credit merely for beginning the album with a flute or other decidedly non-hardcore instruments. These touches often provide the most memorable moments: The gorgeous curtain-raise of female voices that open ""No Epiphany""; ""Twice Born"" and its shout-along chorus (""Hands up if you think you're the only one denied!""); the mystic Black Mountain-style duet on ""Royal Swan"". Along with a sense of community, the album also offers a refreshing take on religion. Fucked Up's spiritual bent is something richer than believers being targeted by secularists aiming to make them look stupid (there's your Religulous spoiler-- save the $10): Chemistry is questioning but rarely cynical, the album's midsection testing faith in the face of reason and science, and finding meaning in the actual search for answers (""Days of Last"", ""No Epiphany""). Chemistry doesn't sit still, and perhaps paradoxically, its most palatable track might be its most divisive-- judging from the ringing open-chords and insistent drum beat of ""Black Albino Bones"", you might get the idea that this is actually an indie rock album (oh yeah, it is on Matador), a forgotten Husker Du track, or god forbid, pop-punk. Were it given a more conventional vocalist, it could easily sidle into MTV with more ease than this performance of ""Twice Born"". But while ""Black Albino Blues"" marks the album's most melodically uplifting track, it might be the most lyrically melancholy, furthering the message of the title track that the magic in our lives is still often a result of nature. ""It's the little things that get us through life,"" barks Pink Eyes before Dallas Green sweetens up with ""I need a little escape."" This still being Fucked Up, it's a song about sex and drugs, but if they happened to leave something out of that eternal triad, it's only because The Chemistry of Common Life kicks enough ass to demand inclusion on its own terms.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12320-the-chemistry-of-common-life/,Matador,2008.0,"If you're a fan of metal, then the album 'The Chemistry of Common Life' by Fucked Up is certainly worth checking out. With an impressive rating of 8.8 out of 10, it's clear that this is an album that resonates with a lot of people. As an agent in the music industry, I had the pleasure of reviewing this album and I must say that it's quite an impressive piece of work.

Let's start with a brief introduction of the band. Fucked Up, formed in Toronto in 2001, is a hardcore punk band that has managed to integrate metal influences into their music in a way that is both dynamic and refreshing. They have a reputation for being punk rockers, but anyone who has listened to their music would testify that their sound is unique and more nuanced than simply being a punk or metal band. They are known for their chaotic live shows and their relentless ambition to push the boundaries of what hardcore punk music could be. 'The Chemistry of Common Life' is a testament to their commitment to that mission.

The creation of 'The Chemistry of Common Life' was an ambitious project with the goal of breaking many of the conventions of punk and metal music. The album was more cerebral and less predictable than many of the typical punk offerings of the time. The band brought together various elements of music and blended them together into something that was both powerful and complex. You can hear the band's varied influences in the music, but these influences have been woven together to create something entirely unique.

The album opens with a slow buildup on ""Son the Father,"" which then explodes into over-the-top metal riffs and unrelenting drums-a classic metal sound. But as the album progresses, you realize that this classic sound is just a scaffold for the band's experimentation. On tracks like ""Black Albino Bones,"" the band integrates harmonies and melodies typical of 1980s pop music, and on ""Golden Seal,"" the band employs a slower tempo and more thoughtful lyrics.

This album is not for the faint of heart. Its intensity is not for everyone, but it can be appreciated by anyone willing to take the time to listen with an open mind. In my personal experience, I found myself appreciating the complexity and depth of the music. The songs have a depth to them that allows the listener to peel back layers of meaning with each listen. The musicianship is impressive, and Damien Abraham's vocals are raw and powerful, adding to the energy of the music.

In conclusion, 'The Chemistry of Common Life' is a masterclass in musical innovation. Fucked Up has created an album that pushes the boundaries of what punk and metal music can be, and it's certainly an album that any fan of metal should check out. With its impressive rating of 8.8 out of 10, it's clear that this album has the potential to stand the test of time. So, buckle up, and give it a listen. You won't be disappointed.","1.

Cave In,Tides of Tomorrow EP,"Metal,Rock",6.9,December 9 2002,Isaiah Violante,,"Boston's Hydra Head Records has become synonymous with the best and brightest of the early twenty-first century hard rock scene. Boasting a catalog replete with talents like Coalesce, Soilent Green, Converge, and Neurosis, Hydra Head has helped cultivate a slew of formidable acts at a fever pitch, only to see the cream of its crop lured away by the substantially larger bankrolls of major labels. Yet, while Hydra Head's roster runs the gamut from prog to metal, few members of their talented stable have exhibited the sonic versatility of their most recent defection, Cave In. Prior to departing for the cushy confines of RCA, Cave In dropped a six-track swan song EP entitled Tides of Tomorrow, completing one of the most dramatic genre shifts in modern rock since Radiohead reinvented themselves with Kid A. Laying its noise-core roots from 1998's Beyond Hypothermia and 1999's Until Your Heart Stops threadbare, and softening the space-rock soundscapes of their critically acclaimed Jupiter LP, Cave In have chosen a more radio-friendly approach, reminiscent of ambitious indie rockers like Failure, Hum, and Juno. Combining shades of emo, alt-rock, and pop with intelligent songwriting, Cave In is clearly on the verge of major mainstream success, the kind of popularity thus far alien to the Hydra Head roster. In all honesty, most of these songs could easily wind up on your local KROQ clone's playlist, up against the likes of Audioslave, Lifehouse, and Puddle of Mudd; with the catchiness of these riffs, the innocuousness of Stephen Brodsky's vocals, and track lengths averaging five minutes, there's nothing remotely intimidating to the casual listener here. Long gone are Brodsky's designs on Tom Araya's vocal stylings: Brodsky's adopted a far more lush, melodic sound, in the vein of David Baker and Black Francis. Adam McGrath's solos are dark and infectious, meandering through Middle Eastern tonalities and metal-head white noise with ease. Peripherally speaking, McGrath and Brodsky's guitar work is the only visible link to the dearly departed noise-core Cave In of old, shuffling in a mountain of effects pedals amidst the more delicate and refined pop/rock sound. This is precisely why a track like ""The Calypso"" works so well: it blends an indie rock sensibility with subtle undertones of progressive metal and space-rock, effortlessly. The title track holds an undeniably Paul McCartney hook, suffused with Brodsky's ethereal harmonizing and the nightmarish, pop-perfect intonations of McGrath and bassist Caleb Scoffield. With a texturally rich canvas of elusive shifts and progressions, and the usual slew of Pet Sounds acoustics, Tides of Tomorrow demands multiple listens in order to fully appreciate its creamy aural goodness; much of its technique and character is lost on the casual critic. Yet, although Tides of Tomorrow excels in its display of musical growth and maturity, much of this seems lost on Brodsky as lyricist, whose metaphors are as sophomoric as ever. His voice also has a pesky habit of straying into that no-man's-land, xFC-metal falsetto. ""Dark Driving"" is a dreary but solid ballad with strong roots in the early, plodding Seattle metal scene a la Soundgarden. The song is spacious and atmospheric, but Brodsky's clumsy play on words-- ""the reality check is in the mail""-- and adenoidal Chris Cornell-meets-Rodney Anonymous timbre is a total disaster. The EP's closer, ""Everest"", falls considerably short of the majesty of its name: Brodsky's accidental impersonation of Aaron Lewis is almost unbearable. Despite the many comparisons made between Radiohead and Cave In following Jupiter's release in 2000, Tides of Tomorrow largely rehashes ground Radiohead covered on The Bends and OK Computer over five years ago. This EP won't be nearly as impressive to weathered indie rock fans as to Hydra Head loyalists; it's an album depicting the growth of an adventurous former metal band, yes, but an ultimately predictable record where the means never exceed the extremes. It's also no doubt that many purists will view this EP-- and the concurrent shift to RCA-- as a sell-out of the highest order. Granted, it's an eye-opener anytime a noise-core band attempts to expand its musical dynamic to encompass inspirations like Spiritualized and Poster Children, but it's also impossible to ignore the marked shift toward accessibility and ""easier"" listening embraced by Cave In since the close of the 1990s.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1361-tides-of-tomorrow-ep/,Hydra Head,2002.0,"When it comes to Cave In, the band's history is as intriguing as it is diverse. From their early days as a metalcore band to their progressive rock/metal output in the 2000s, they've always been a band that's difficult to pin down. Tides of Tomorrow EP continues down that path, showcasing a band that's still evolving and pushing boundaries.

First, let's talk about the EP's creation. After a hiatus that spanned several years, the band came together to record what would eventually become Tides of Tomorrow. The EP was recorded over the course of several sessions, with the band opting to record in their home state of Massachusetts.

The resulting EP is a mixed bag, showcasing the band's breadth of influences and styles. Opener ""Anchor"" is a pummeling metal track that showcases the band's heavier side. It's a song that's sure to get mosh pits moving and heads banging. ""Shake My Blood"" is a different animal altogether; it's a moody, atmospheric piece that showcases Cave In's more experimental side. Its sprawling guitar work and haunting vocals give it a deeply introspective feel.

Despite the diversity on display, there are some issues that keep the EP from reaching its full potential. The biggest issue is the lack of cohesion. While the songs are individually strong, they each feel disconnected from the others, making for a disjointed listening experience.

That being said, there are some standout moments on the EP. ""Lanterna"" is a gorgeous instrumental track that really showcases the band's musical chops. Its shimmering guitar tones and twinkling keyboard work give it a celestial feel that's truly breathtaking. ""Strange Reflection"" is also a winner, with its driving rhythm section and soaring choruses.

All in all, Tides of Tomorrow EP is a mixed bag, showcasing a band that's still figuring things out. While there are some standout tracks here, the lack of cohesion and occasional missteps make it difficult to recommend for all but Cave In's most dedicated fans. Still, there's plenty here for those who are willing to give it a chance.","1. Review A has a more complex and descriptive writing style, with rich and varied vocabulary.

The 1975,"I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it",Rock,6.5,February 25 2016,Laura Snapes,Contributor,"Last November, the 1975 frontman Matt Healy took shots at Justin Bieber's ""What Do You Mean."" ""'When you nod your head yes but you wanna say no'—can we stop talking about girls who don't know what they want?"" he despaired. ""Can we stop talking about nothingness? No one's asking you to inspire a revolution, but inspire something."" Like some of his provocative Manchester forebears, Healy has a giant mouth on him, but unlike them, he doesn't seem interested in tearing others down, just demanding more. This neurotic want drives his music, which in turn inspires wildly conflicting feelings: fervent adoration on one end, intense rage at the other. The ire directed at the 1975's very existence seems odd, considering their self-titled 2013 debut was basically inoffensive pop-rock pitched somewhere between Phoenix, the Strokes, and Jimmy Eat World. But there is something deeper at work in the objections, and Healy's rebuke of Bieber provides a hint: Although the group approaches their work with a level of ambition and self-seriousness usually reserved for rock bands like, say, Radiohead—The 1975 is 16 songs long, with three ambient interludes, including a glacial choral opener called ""The 1975""—they have the look, feel, and requisite huge teen girl fanbase of a boy band. Pure pop has been a cool palette for left-field artists to play around with for a few years now, but the boy band model has remained terminally uncool. Hurts are maybe as close as it's come; if PC Music really want to be transgressive, perhaps they should give it a shot. Even One Direction tried to escape the genre's sanitized connotations toward the end of their existence, when they were allowed to manifest a little authorship along with their stadium rock dreams. The 1975 don't wear matching suits or sell branded trinkets to the under-10s, yet after years of playing to nobody, they became a boy band by virtue of a voracious social media fanbase—not that they seemed happy about it at first. Once they realized the extent of their audience’s adulation—and indignation when they reshot the monochrome video for ""Sex"" in full color after signing to a major—they played around with them, pulling disappearing acts and refashioning their iconography. Everything about I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it indicates that the 1975 have embraced girl love, color, and their boy band potential. Healy likes to talk about his band as a post-modern project that creates as people consume, but this ultimately isn't that radical when it comes to pop music, always the magpie. When you sleep... has a much more distinct and iconoclastic character than their slick debut, drawing from the effervescent, percolating polish of early '80s Hot 100 pop that they flirted with on ""Heart Out."" Single ""Love Me,"" for instance, flagrantly splices Bowie's ""Fame"" and ""Fashion."" The resemblance to acts like Scritti Politti, INXS, the Police, and Hall and Oates also makes it feel like the X-rated cousin of Taylor Swift's 1989 and Carly Rae Jepsen's E•MO•TION—despite Healy's brash exterior, his primary mode is lovelorn and yearning. That doesn't mean that When you sleep is consistent by any stretch. It's 75 minutes long, which could mostly be solved by trimming the four (!) lengthy ambient tracks on the record. It opens with a darker reworking of ""The 1975"" (!!) that evokes Sigur Rós; ""Lostmyhead"" sounds like M83; the title track Bon Iver and Everything Ecstatic-era Four Tet. Their stab at emulating Brian Eno's ""The Big Ship"" is pretty good, except that it is called ""Please Be Naked"" (!!!). But, man: when compared to the UK's current crop of milquetoast electro-balladeers, the 1975's unabashed pomp and seeming imperviousness to ridicule make you want to kiss them. It helps, too, that When you sleep can be enormous fun. ""She's American"" is all slap-bass fizz and clenched-fist vocal delivery; ""The Sound"" is pumping, uber-camp piano house. Although their sound is clean-cut, Healy's lyrics are anything but: On the debut, Healy was coke-addled and fucked up, but When you sleep finds him trying to reform, a process hobbled by the circumstances of his new superstar life. Like a lot of When you sleep, his lyrics dip perilously from inspiring to embarrassing. For every neatly zeitgeist-capturing couplet like ""I'm just with my friends online and there's things we'd like to change"" from ""Love Me,"" there's something like, ""Caught up in fashion—Karcrashian panache and a bag of bash for passion"" from the same song, which only makes Healy sound like the trustafarian street poet that he already slightly resembles. ""Love Me"" is nothing, though, compared to its counterpart, ""Loving Someone,"" which will vindicate anyone who decided to hate the 1975 on principle. Musically it's an outlier—it has the sweet, compressed insectlike burble of Baths or Bibio, and is the most synthetic thing here. Healy switches from singing to sort-of rapping, Lily Allen-style, in forensic, anguished detail about the superficial example that the world shows to young people. Steady yourself: ""Charlatan telepathy exploiting insecurity and praying on the purity of grief and its simplicity/ But I know that maybe I'm too skeptical/ Even Guy Debord needed spectacles/ You see, I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques and I'm trying to progress/ But instead of selling sex, I think I should be loving someone."" It's like something Neil Tennant might have written if he had embraced the ludicrousness of mid-'80s pop instead of subverting it, and thank God he did. Dropping Debord's ""Society of the Spectacle"" is a massive 'look at me!' clanger, but Healy substantiates the song's agonies with unvarnished accounts of how he's fallen prey to these pressures. He often sings about his mental health: ""UGH!"" is West Coast funk R&B lite about addiction, while ""The Ballad of Me and My Brain"" is pure stadium Sting in which he searches for his mind; he figures he might have left it in a supermarket, where it's ""flirting with the girls."" He searches for a higher power on ""If I Believe You,"" a biblical, Michael Jackson-indebted slow jam gilded with a gospel choir. The closing lines are silly on paper—""if I'm lost, then how can I find myself?""—but buried in Autre Ne Veut-style ecclesiastical synth washes, his earnestness becomes surprisingly affecting. In ""Loving Someone,"" Healy asked who would ""show the kids that they matter."" It's a trite line, but unlike so much ""be yrself"" Hot 100 pop, the 1975 never coddles the listener; instead, they respect their audience by believing them to be capable of handling everything they sing about, from coke psychosis to dead grandmothers (""Nana"") and post-natal depression (""She Lays Down""). They give them the credit to find the Easter Eggs hidden in their music, from melodies that echo old material (""The Sound"" calls back to ""She Way Out"") to sequels of first album situations (""A Change of Heart"" follows on from ""Robbers""). Perhaps their greatest tribute is that the 1975, despite being in their mid-twenties, are just like them: messy, earnest, vulnerable, unedited, gaudy. For Britain's biggest young guitar band to ditch laddy machismo, embrace the boy band ideal, and run on feeling rather than posturing—that feels kind of radical. When you sleep can be far too much, but it's not cynical.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21412-i-like-it-when-you-sleep-for-you-are-so-beautiful-yet-so-unaware-of-it/,"Interscope,Dirty Hit",2016.0,"When The 1975 released their second album “I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it” in February 2016, it was clear that the band had taken a different direction from their eponymous debut album. The band had already established themselves as indie rockers with their debut release, but with “I like it when you sleep...”, they became something more. The album's 80s-inspired synth-pop sound, along with its shimmering production, was a bold departure from their previous work.

Many listeners were left wondering why the band had made such a drastic change from their initial indie rock sound. It wasn't so much that they had abandoned their roots, but they had evolved beyond them. They were in the midst of their musical metamorphosis, and this album marks that transformation.

The 1975's lead singer Matty Healy spent months perfecting the tracks on ""I like it when you sleep..."", with the help of producer Michael Crossey. Healy has always been open about his preference for “music that makes you feel something”. This is a perfect way to describe the effect that the album has on listeners. It elicits emotions that range from introspection to exhilaration.

One aspect that stands out in this album is the diversity in the sound. The 1975 showcases a range of styles, from the sombre opening track “The 1975” to the upbeat and addictive “UGH!”. This album offers something for everyone, and it's a testament to Healy’s writing and the band's ability to navigate the different musical styles.

The beauty of this album lies in its ability to speak to listeners on a personal level. The lyrics are introspective and relatable, and Matty Healy's delivery is vulnerable and emotive. The song “She's American” isn't just about an American girl, it encapsulates the experience of falling in love with someone who may not necessarily be good for you. There are layers of complexity to this album that make the tracks stand out and feel genuine. 

Though it's an impressive effort by the band, it's not without its faults. At times, the production can feel overwhelming, and the 80s-inspired sound can feel like an imitation rather than an innovation. While the album has its moments, it's not one that grips you from start to finish.

In conclusion, “I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it"" by The 1975 is an album that takes risks with its sound and style. Regardless of its faults, the album is a reminder that music is meant to be felt, not just heard. It speaks to the human experience in a way that is both relatable and introspective. This album is well-worth listening to, as it paints a picture of a band in transition, and displays their creative and musical talent in a way that few other albums can.","1.

Chromeo,Business Casual,Electronic,6.9,September 22 2010,Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,"Business Casual, Chromeo's third full-length, cements them as true scholars of squelchy chart pop. It's as if they spent three years inhaling the entire repertoire of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis before putting that knowledge to action. The record is their first on Atlantic, and they've put that major label money to good use: This sounds expensive and studio-finessed, a facet no doubt aided by Cassius member Philipe Zdar's mixing skills. The depth of production here is quite literal; when there's space to breathe on these tracks, it feels like a cavernous expanse rather than dead air.

More money means more studio time, and more studio time can lead to more experimentation; as such, Business Casual's most successful moments are the result of genre-related leg-stretching. ""Don't Walk Away"" captures the symphonic grandiosity of side-long disco edits in under four minutes, syrupy strings and all. Elsewhere, the record's showstopping midsection-- ""Night by Night"", ""Don't Turn the Lights On"", and ""You Make it Rough""-- dives deep into icy, moonlit electro sounds, the latter taking a seven-minute journey from the heart to the stars. If that description brings to mind Junior Boys, it's because at their best, Chromeo are doing something not too dissimilar in function: synthesizing a wide range of erudite musical signifiers into something more tangibly direct and pop. The duo succeed at constructing sumptuous backdrops on this record, almost to a fault. Despite its richly detailed excesses, Business Casual nonetheless feels slighter than Chromeo's previous efforts due to a relative lack of hooks. Opener ""Hot Mess"" oscillates tediously, with near-ridiculous spoken word interjections. The Solange Knowles collaboration ""When the Night Falls"" is a missed opportunity, as Solange is reduced to wailing the ill-fitting chorus while Dave 1 turns in a weak, barely murmured vocal performance. If you want a soft-rock update of Billy Joel's ""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me"", see album closer ""Grow Up"" (but don't say we didn't warn you). Granted, Business Casual comes close to superseding previous LP Fancy Footwork in two ways: ""J'ai Claqué La Porte"" combines the seemingly now-token ""sparse song"" and ""French song"" into one to minimize filler, and there's not a single song here that's named ""Tenderoni"" (ugh). Otherwise, the record is a unique situation, as it represents Chromeo's growth as master arrangers and producers, despite feeling like a step backwards in overall quality.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14649-business-casual/,Atlantic,2010.0,"Chromeo's ""Business Casual"" is a musical feast for the ears that combines the best of the electronic genre with a playful, retro vibe that keeps listeners engaged from beginning to end. As someone who has been a fan of Chromeo's sound for years, I was excited to dive into this album and see what the duo had in store.

One of the things that makes Chromeo so unique is their blend of 80s-influenced music with modern electronic elements, and ""Business Casual"" is no exception. From the opening track ""Hot Mess"" to the funky ""Don't Turn The Lights On"", the album has a cohesive sound that is upbeat, energetic, and perfect for dancing.

But what really stands out on this album is the duo's songwriting abilities. Each track has its own distinct story to tell, with themes ranging from unrequited love to the struggles of the modern workforce. However, even with these weighty topics, Chromeo manages to inject a sense of whimsy and humor into their lyrics that makes them feel relatable and human.

One of my personal favorite tracks on the album is ""Night by Night"", which features catchy vocals and a disco-inspired beat that is impossible to resist. The chorus is especially infectious, with lines like ""I wanna be your girl all night by night"" that get stuck in your head for hours.

In terms of production value, ""Business Casual"" is top-notch. The electronic elements are carefully crafted and mixed with live instrumentation, creating a sound that is both futuristic and nostalgic at the same time. It's clear that Chromeo took their time creating each track and paid attention to every detail, resulting in an album that is polished and professional.

Overall, I would give ""Business Casual"" a solid 6.9 out of 10 rating. While it's not my all-time favorite Chromeo album, it's a strong contender that showcases the duo's talents as songwriters, producers, and performers. If you're a fan of electronic music, retro vibes, or just want an album to dance to, ""Business Casual"" is definitely worth a listen.","1.

808 State,Blueprint: The Best of 808 State,Electronic,7.5,September 15 2011,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"In the late 1980s, 808 State asked themselves a couple of important questions: Was it possible to get the masses to rise up and embrace instrumental beatscapes? Could a couple of guys with a couple of keyboards become a pop group without ever really writing pop songs? Should a house or techno act even bother releasing an album aimed at a general audience? There was no real evidence that the answer to any of these questions was ""yes,"" but 808, along with a handful of other ambitious crossover types, persisted anyway. Thanks to a mixture of luck, timing, and skill, 808 actually succeeded. And more than an any other crossover 1990s dance act, they stayed true to both their club and avant-electronic roots. The career-spanning Blueprint proves that 808 did have a certain commercial instinct almost from the start. What's more surprising is how big they scored with the stuff on Blueprint that sounds the least commercial. 808 came up in the early days of British rave by making intense and dense compositions that represented club music at its furthest-out, anticipating the kind of abstract hardcore electronica that didn't quite exist just yet. It's a thrillingly manic and claustrophobic sound, enough so that it inspired more than a few future IDM tyros. On the other hand, it's unsurprising that the caustic acid maximalism of ""Flow Coma"" never charted. 808's next single, however, hit in the biggest possible way. Relaxing a bit, like rave as a whole for a brief second, they scored massively with the platonically placid ""Pacific State"". The tune that helped to enshrine both the saxophone and the birdcall as part of the softer side of dance music's vocabulary, ""Pacific"" still has enough of techno's antic bounce to make it seem like a great lost direction for pop, where hippie relaxation vibes and bright video game funk are not incompatible. An accountant probably would have told them to ride their status as chill-out pioneers until it stopped being profitable, which could have lasted at least until Moby smothered the trend stone-dead with the success of Play. Instead 808 released a few charmingly clunky takes on hip-house that are left out on Blueprint. That certainly helps the collection's flow, even if it does underline why the group calls this their ""greatest bits"" rather than a complete overview. When they finally rebounded, creatively, it once again paid off commercially. ""Pacific"" and their Brit-rap adventures had clearly given them an appreciation for ideas of beauty and fun that conformed to 99 percent of humanity's. But they never quite lost their taste for the robots-in-meltdown fierceness of ""Flow Coma"". ""Cubik"" and ""In Yer Face"" were among the 808's biggest non-""Pacific"" hits, but they were also among their rawest tunes. The difference is that the intensity now felt brash and joyful rather than hermetic and kinda creepy. But the fact that one of 808's albums was called Gorgeous should give you an indication that their sympathies ultimately lay more with ""Pacific State"" than ""In Yer Face"". Gorgeousness as an end in itself sometimes led 808 to slick and forgettable tracks like ""Plan 9"", which has as much passion and inventiveness as the house-as-high-end-hotel-muzak they unfortunately helped inspire. But even ""Plan 9"" doesn't outstay its welcome. Early adopters of the ""radio edit"" approach to taking electronic dance into the mainstream, even 808's opulent ambient stuff almost always has an instrumental earworm to get you humming. So, in addition to being just damn listenable, front to back, Blueprint's also fascinating as a look at one group's answer to Brit dance culture's warring impulses in the 90s. 808's most memorable music is never split between opulent ambiance designed for the laid-back appreciation of connoisseurs and rugged slabs of computer madness to pump the adrenaline of young folks juiced on rave's novelty. The two are almost always mixed up into the same tunes, the wild beat constructions complimented by a real musical richness. That's probably why they've endured, while so many one-note singles from 808's peers have faded away.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15824-blueprint-the-best-of-808-state/,Salvo,2011.0,"Hey there, music lovers! I want to talk to you today about Blueprint: The Best of 808 State by 808 State. If you're a fan of electronic music, you owe it to yourself to give this album a listen. From start to finish, it's an exciting journey through the history of one of the most influential electronic acts of our time.

Before we dive into the music, let's talk about the band's history. 808 State first burst onto the scene in Manchester, England back in 1987. Their early work was experimental and groundbreaking, combining elements of acid house, techno, and hip-hop. They were among the first electronic music groups to embrace sampling and layering, paving the way for the genre's prevalent use of those techniques in the years to come. 

Now, let's fast forward to 2002, when Blueprint: The Best of 808 State was released. As the album title suggests, it's a collection of the band's best tracks - some previously released, some remixed, and some newly created for the album. As a result, the album serves as both an introduction to the band's body of work and a tribute to their evolution as artists. 

Some of the standout tracks include ""Pacific State"", with its catchy synth riff and shimmering percussion, and ""Cubik"", a pulsing dancefloor anthem that will have you moving in no time. ""In Yer Face"" is another standout, with its hypnotic beat and catchy vocal samples. What I love about this album is how it showcases the band's range and versatility. There's a little something for everyone, from the dreamy soundscapes of ""Lift"" to the frenetic energy of ""Nimbus"". 

As someone who grew up on electronic music, I have a lot of respect for what 808 State have accomplished. They're pioneers in the genre, with a sound that's instantly recognizable and influential. Even though Blueprint: The Best of 808 State is a retrospective album, it still feels fresh and exciting. The band's music stands the test of time, and this album is the perfect example of that.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of electronic music or just looking for something new to listen to, give Blueprint: The Best of 808 State a spin. It's the perfect way to get acquainted with a legendary band and their groundbreaking work. On a 7.5 out of 10 scale, I'd give this album an 8.5. It's well worth a listen!","1.

Euphone,Hashin' It Out,Rock,7.1,October 31 2000,Spencer Owen,,"The name Euphone has a pleasant connotation. While not technically a word, at least by dictionary standards, it's closely linked to the word ""euphony."" For the ""differently literate"" among you, ""euphony"" means a sound or collection of sounds crafted to please the ear. It implies pure, unfettered joy through music, an uncommon melodic experience that rises above many others. Euphone, then, would appear to resemble an instrument or mechanism responsible for creating this type of euphony. That being said, Euphone still don't quite live up to their namesake, but they're getting closer. Chicago's Ryan Rapsys and Nick Macri are both multi-instrumentalists, but at their hearts, they're simply drums and bass, both part of the former Heroic Doses rhythm section, and masterful at their craft. Unfortunately, 1999's The Calendar of Unlucky Days was a fairly drab record with minimal instrumentation and little jazz-inflected post-rock variety. Luckily, with the 13 new tracks on Hashin' It Out, Rapsys and Macri attempt to bring more diversity to their sound, as well as more guest musicians than ever to flesh it out. And it works; why, without the brilliant, all-star conga work by Dan Bitney of Isotope 217 and Tortoise on ""Do You Up,"" the record would have surely failed! Okay, I'll cut the sarcasm. In reality, the new formula does work to Euphone's advantage. Hashin' It Out isn't a terribly cohesive record, and it does drop in quality near the end, but its pleasures are substantial, common, and fun enough to be commendable. When acting alone, there are more hits than misses this time out, such as the laid-back opener, ""Gyrations,"" featuring electronically manipulated vocals and dreamy, effect-laden guitar and bass. Despite their multi-instrumental capabilities, though, Euphone had the good taste to give their guests some creative input, and it works strongly in the album's favor. The record's finest tracks were created with the help of Jeremy Jacobsen, a member of 5ive Style and otherwise known as the Lonesome Organist. On ""Press On"" and ""Bad Ascending,"" easily two of the record's highlights, Rapsys and Macri act as the skilled rhythm section, adding occasional keyboard accompaniment while Jacobsen contributes complex guitar parts. It all comes off effortlessly, and stands as the closest thing to euphony these guys have created yet. The other two songs featuring Jacobsen don't quite match the others, but they do succeed. ""Where's the B?"" is just over two minutes of pure funk with Jacobsen's occasional angular guitar. Without Jacobsen, Euphone seem to meander a bit more. The record's oddball is ""Newscast,"" a minute-long foray into the world of composing theme music for your local TV news program. But tracks like ""Nick is Ryan"" seem to create the result of effective spontaneity that many of the others on Hashin' It Out strive for. And while the rest achieve varying degrees of success-- excepting ""Confirmation of Suspicions,"" the aimlessly rambling five-minute closer-- there's rarely another memorable melody or structure to be found. Euphone have finally discovered that collaboration is the key to their success, and Hashin' It Out is the proof. That's not to say that they aren't talented on their own, but if Jeremy Jacobsen joined Euphone to create a full-time trio, perhaps we could expect more cohesive results on their next effort. Far be it from me to offer a band career advice, of course, but it never hurts to mention it, right?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2846-hashin-it-out/,"Jade Tree,Jade Tree",,"Hashin' It Out by Euphone is a rock album with a rating of 7.1 out of 10, and it certainly deserves at least that score. This album has a lot of heart and soul poured into it that is apparent and comes through in the music. It's an album that fans of rock music will want to add to their collections.

Euphone is an interesting band that has been around since the late '90s. The band consists of a rotating cast of members, but central member and founder, Ryan Rapsys, is the man behind the music. He's a multi-instrumentalist and producer who has worked with a number of impressive musicians over the years. As far as the creation story of Hashin' It Out goes, Rapsys has said that he wanted to make an album that had a bit of an edge to it, something that would rock hard but also had a lot of nuance and dynamics to it.

After listening to the album, I would say that Rapsys nailed that goal. The songs on the album are powerful and explosive, but they also have a lot of subtle moments where the music pulls back and becomes introspective. These are the moments where the album shines the brightest. It's clear that Rapsys has a lot of experience both in front of and behind the mixing board, and that experience really pays off here.

As for my personal experience with the album, I have to say that I was impressed. I'm a big fan of rock music, and Euphone definitely delivers the goods. The songs are well-written and well-produced, and the musicianship is impressive. I particularly enjoyed the songs ""Don't Leave Us,"" ""Flower Moon,"" and ""Duty Free."" These songs all have a great amount of energy and emotion behind them, and they make me want to get up and dance or play my air guitar.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Hashin' It Out by Euphone to any rock music fan. It's an album with a lot to offer, and it's clear that a lot of hard work went into making it. This is a band that should be on your radar if it isn't already.","1. Review A contains a more descriptive and detailed introduction, while Review B jumps straight into the album review.

VietNam,The Concrete's Always Grayer on the Other Side of the Street EP,Rock,5.0,August 24 2004,Jonathan Zwickel,Contributor,"Skater punks, hip-hop vegans, frat boys, art geeks, lesbian indie chicks, mesh-hatted bedroom DJs, listen up: There hasn't been a more influential multimedia reacharound since Grand Royal. I'm talking about the uberhip, post-nihilist Vice empire. Birthed as a hilariously/repulsively degenerate magazine, Vice now embodies a film and TV production company, clothing line, and inevitable record label, presumably spawned as a funnel for all the musical effluvium snagged up by the magazine's cultural colander. Perhaps feeling underrepresented by the tongue-in-cheek electrofunk duo Chromeo (half-comprised of a Vice mag staffer), those cute ex-Canadians have gone and snagged themselves a jangly guitar duo to balance the roster. Vietnam's debut EP arrived at my door with no press info, no web info, and no prelude. The Polaroid images on the cover could've been taken from the magazine's recent ""Party Issue""-- two shaggy dudes with big mustaches offhandedly flicking off the photographer. It's a delicious, Zen-like feeling, not knowing what to expect and expecting nothing. If there's one thing I've learned from years of reading Vice, it's that inconsistency is the norm. I'm wrestling the urge to sum up this EP with a smarmy, shit-eating donkey punch, a far cry from the usual upstanding intellectualism this humble weblication is known for. Taboo, yes, but in homage to the muse I'm just gonna say fuck it and swing away, because one lyrical quotation from vocalist/guitarist Michael William, sung through his nose exactly like an exaggerated Jason Pierce, says it all: ""It makes... No diiiifference... To meeee..."" William and guitarist/vocalist Joshua Garrett so perfectly embody the witty, fuck-if-I-care ambivalence that spikes the copy of Vice magazine that I'm almost waiting for a chime to tell me to turn the page. Over the course of five songs, William and Garrett take turns shamelessly aping the sacred cool of their space-rock forebears (especially Spacemen 3), accompanying their admittedly soulful vocal mimicry on guitars and bass. I'd love to describe this music without comparison, but Vietnam is so self-consciously imitative they practically beg for a bullet list. Starting with a mellow guitar strum pulled straight from ""Heroin""'s reverent intro, the album burrows into Velvets melodrama with ""Too Tired"" and continues straight into the 10-minute anti-anthem of ""Makes No Difference"". Both here-- and later on with the overlong ""Apocalypse""-- William's Dylan-esque drawl is disquieting, since the delivery is transparent but the words debased (ex. ""As you're lying there; you pull your fuckin' cock so you can prove you're not dead""). Musically, though, ""Makes No Difference"" is all VU, stretching out over an opiated tambourine pulse that keeps time against a languid, droning guitar that eventually crashes into a heavy reverbed climax. Here, Sterling Morrison and J. Spaceman lock horns in a hopeless, epic battle of influence. But those lyrics, again, just scream postured detachment-- ""'Cuz baby, this is my life/ And everything else, man, it makes no difference/ To me."" Garrett takes a turn on the mic with ""Princess"", his lifted Lou Reed photorealism perfectly affecting glam trash lyrics like, ""Well, you see she laid up in bed/ Eightballs dance through her head."" The talent with these guys lies in the dead-on pantomiming of their heroes, and their ability to do it with ridiculous sincerity. Which is somewhat respectable given the accuracy of the shot, and is a novelty for the first couple spins. Gauge your interest by your tolerance for rock 'n' roll voyeurism, self-loathing, and Lower East Side style checking. Like an average experience with Vice, whether you love this stuff, laugh at it, or loathe it naturally depends on how many beers have lubed your motor. For that reason I'd say seeing Vietnam in a crowded, low-ceilinged bar with a bottle in hand would yield a much fuller experience than listening to the album in your living room. As of this writing I'm putting down PBR #3, and that five-point-oh rating is starting to feel a little harsh.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8535-the-concretes-always-grayer-on-the-other-side-of-the-street-ep/,Vice,2004.0,"Let's talk about VietNam's latest EP, ""The Concrete's Always Grayer on the Other Side of the Street."" This rock album has a rating of 5 out of 10, which might turn some people off at first. But let me tell you, this EP deserves a chance.

For those who may not be familiar with the band, VietNam originally formed in New York City in 2003. Their sound has evolved over the years, drawing inspiration from various genres such as rock, blues, and psychedelic. The band's lineup has also experienced changes, but lead singer Michael Gerner has remained a constant.

Now, onto the EP itself. ""The Concrete's Always Grayer on the Other Side of the Street"" is a collection of six songs that VietNam worked on for over two years. The album was recorded in a Brooklyn studio, where the band experimented with different sounds and instruments to create a unique sound.

Upon first listen, I was struck by how hauntingly beautiful the opening track, ""One Hundred Years,"" was. With its slow guitar riffs and Gerner's emotive vocals, the song sets the mood for the rest of the album. ""Then I Saw You"" is another standout track with its catchy chorus and upbeat tempo.

As I listened to the EP more, I was drawn to the personal nature of the lyrics. ""Food Chain"" addresses the realities of modern society, while ""Insanity"" touches on the struggles of mental health. It's clear that VietNam is not afraid to delve into heavy topics and create music that has a deeper meaning.

While ""The Concrete's Always Grayer on the Other Side of the Street"" may not be everyone's cup of tea, I found that it grew on me with each listen. The album's production is spot-on, with each instrument and sound working together seamlessly. The overall sound might be described as a mix between The Black Keys and The Doors.

In conclusion, I highly recommend giving VietNam's ""The Concrete's Always Grayer on the Other Side of the Street"" a listen. The EP showcases the band's growth and versatility and is perfect for those who want to listen to something new and thought-provoking. Give it a chance and see if it becomes a favorite of yours too.","1. Review A uses more informal language and has a more irreverent tone, while Review B is more straightforward and objective.

Lil Wayne,No Ceilings,Rap,7.7,November 16 2009,Tom Breihan,Contributor,"No Ceilings. Nice title. Nice concept, too. Here's Wayne explaining it, on one of his new mixtape's blessedly few skits: ""I would love for you to look up into the building and understand that there is no ceilings; there is only the sky."" And in his case, it's true; Wayne's potential greatness seems to have no limit-- or if it does have a limit, it's difficult to say what it might be. Wayne's tough to evaluate because he's so very rarely operating at peak capacity. Whereas a classically great rapper (Ready to Die-era Biggie, say) might hammer his concepts straight on until he's bludgeoned them into atoms, Wayne barely ever has any concepts, hopscotching frantically but lazily between ideas and chasing digressions down gopher holes. Wayne's digressive, distracted spirit is a huge part of what makes him great; even at his Carter II peak, he was always slippery and unpredictable and defiantly weird. But ever since he indisputably became the most popular rapper in the world last year, he's been in a strange zone, trusting his instincts to the point where he's now preparing to drop a whole album of somebody's idea of rock on us. And his instincts are, more often than not, bad. Add that to his purportedly staggering drug use and his upcoming prison sentence, and it's tough to tell just how far he could fall. Wayne's got no ceilings, but he's got no floors either. And given the increasingly scattered nature of his post-Carter III work, the existence of No Ceilings is just a tremendous relief. After last year's wildly disappointing Dedication 3, Wayne's finally back to something like his Dedication 2/Drought 3 fighting shape and doing what he does best, swiping beats from all the songs on rap radio and rendering the originals obsolete. Pity F.L.Y. and Dorrough after what Wayne did to ""Swag Surfin'"" and ""Ice Cream Paint Job"". Beats like those are where Wayne traditionally comes off best; those cheap, tense, springy synthetic tracks make Wayne's berserk rasp sound something like catharsis. Wayne's got no compunctions about snatching up a middling regional dance-rap mini-hit, and that appetite serves him well. When you throw him on something busier and bigger-budget like Jay-Z's ""D.O.A."" or ""Run This Town"", he doesn't sound quite as at home. So it's fortunate that Wayne still has a bug up his ass about Jay. On those two tracks, he just goes absolutely ripshit, throwing slick subliminals at Jay or just laughing Jay's barbs off. At least on mixtapes, Wayne doesn't have Jay's drive to build eternal monuments to his own importance; he's free to just spazz out. So, on ""Run This Town"": ""New Orleans Coroner, his name is Frank Minyard/ Fuck with me wrong, you'll be waking up in his yard."" (A Google search confirms that New Orleans' Coroner is indeed named Frank Minyard. Wayne: Backing up his insane threats with verifiable facts!) In some intriguing ways, the rise of Gucci Mane presents an interesting challenge to this sort of Wayne mixtape. Gucci represents an evolution of Wayne's free-associative style, one simultaneously spacier and more focused. Gucci has none of Wayne's cursory desire for acceptance from NY true-schoolers, and he favors the kind of dinky, catchy budget beats that Wayne loves stealing on tapes like these. Wayne raps over three Gucci tracks on No Ceilings, as well as one from Gucci associate Waka Flocka, but he doesn't treat these tracks like challenges the way he does with the Jay songs. He probably should, since the Gucci songs are the rare mixtape tracks where Wayne can't erase the memory of the originals. And No Ceilings certainly has its problems. Wayne might never again sound as flat-out committed as he did on Dedication 2. His punchlines don't always carry the same impact, and he's more likely to laugh at his own jokes. He shares valuable mic time with tolerable nonentities like Lucci Lou and Gudda Gudda. He picks a few tracks like the Black Eyed Peas' ""I Gotta Feeling"", songs that just aren't conducive to great rapping. He swipes a few terrible sex-rap tracks and makes slightly less terrible sex-rap tracks out of them, though even those will dependably include a few appealingly loony lines (""I get it wetter than bass pussy"" is supposed to be seductive?). He's not quite the animal he was. But No Ceilings once again finds Wayne in total control of beats, motivated and sliding freely between ideas. He pronounces ""alps"" and ""stealth"" and ""milf"" like they all rhyme with each other. He's scatological: ""I'm on some shit ain't even been out the ass yet."" He's haughty: ""Elevator in my crib cause it's five floors/ I'm not expecting you to have one inside yours."" He's on his half-sensical pop culture shit: ""I get big chips; you get Alvins."" He's capable of coming up with lines that get stuck in your head for no conceivable reason: ""I'm flyer than the highest flying bird around this ho."" He's frankly disgusting: ""I made the pussy gleek."" And with the twin trials of prison and Rebirth looming, it's just enormously gratifying to hear that he still knows how to rap, that he loves doing it. After all, nobody does it like him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13672-no-ceilings/,Young Money Entertainment,2009.0,"If one artist has managed to redefine the world of rap over the past decade, it would undoubtedly be Lil Wayne. With his 2005 album ""Tha Carter II,"" Lil Wayne became a household name and has since released numerous critically-acclaimed and commercially successful projects. However, his 2009 mixtape ""No Ceilings"" remains one of his most beloved works, showcasing his relentless skill and versatility as an MC.

Before we dive into the beauty that is ""No Ceilings,"" let's talk about Lil Wayne's background. Born Dwayne Carter, Lil Wayne began his career in the late 90s, quickly making a name for himself as a member of the Hot Boys. With the release of his solo album ""Tha Block Is Hot"" in 1999, Lil Wayne solidified his promising career in hip-hop. He has been consistently releasing studio albums and mixtapes, and in 2009, he dropped ""No Ceilings.""

""No Ceilings"" is a mixtape that features Lil Wayne rapping over a range of popular beats, including instrumentals from Jay-Z's ""Run This Town,"" Drake's ""Forever,"" and Black Eyed Peas' ""I Gotta Feeling."" The album was created in only a few days, but Lil Wayne doesn't let that affect the quality of the tracks on this album.

On ""No Ceilings,"" we see Lil Wayne at the top of his game. His rapid-fire delivery is present throughout the entire tape, showcasing his unmatched technical ability. He isn't just a great rapper, but he is a master of wordplay and metaphor, as he blends together punchlines and internal rhymes with incredible ease. His flow is impeccable and his delivery is smooth, exemplifying his status as one of the greatest rappers of all-time.

The mixtape opens with ""Swag Surf,"" a rapid-fire banger where Lil Wayne sets the tone for the rest of the album. His clever wordplay shines through as he raps about his success and his intention to keep striving forward. The track is one of the album's most memorable and sets the bar high for what's to come.

""No Ceilings"" also includes collaborations with prominent artists such as Tyga, Shanell, and Lil Twist. These features add an extra dimension to the album, and their unique and diverse styles complement Lil Wayne's rapping perfectly.

Overall, ""No Ceilings"" is a must-hear for anyone who considers themselves a fan of Lil Wayne or the rap genre as a whole. It is a testament to Lil Wayne's incredible skill and creativity, showcasing a seamless blend of his own work and some of the most popular beats of the time. His lyricism and musical genius are on full display, and his ability to construct a mixtape in mere days is an impressive feat that only adds to Lil Wayne's status as one of the most talented artists in the game. 

In my opinion, I would rate this album a 7.7 out of 10. Although there are times when Lil Wayne's lyricism can be a bit predictable, the overall package of ""No Ceilings"" is solid, showcasing his incredible versatility as an MC. The project seamlessly blends together humor, braggadocio, and introspection, which are three aspects commonly associated with Lil Wayne's style. ""No Ceilings"" is an enjoyable, technically impressive, and superbly crafted album that shares a significant place in Lil Wayne's storied career.","1.

Various Artists,Palenque Palenque: Champeta Criolla & Afro Roots in Colombia 1975-91,,8.2,July 9 2010,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"The word ""palenque"" can refer to a number of things, including several geographical locations, but in the context of this compilation, it has two important meanings. Broadly, in Spanish-speaking Latin America, the term is used to refer to a city or village founded by people of African descent (sometimes joined by Native Americans), usually escaped slaves. In Colombia specifically, the town of San Basilio de Palenque is one of the last places where a Spanish-Bantu creole language called Palenquero is still commonly spoken. It's a unique and endangered language that most Spanish speakers can't understand, and it's one of the starkest reminders of Colombia's centuries-old cultural link to Africa via slavery-- around 20% of Colombia's population has African ancestry. African currents run through much of the popular music of Latin America, but in 1970s Colombia an interesting thing happened: The then-current popular musics of Colombia and West Africa merged to create an updated Afro-Latin sound that ultimately evolved into champeta in the 1980s. This unique, omnivorous genre of Colombian music eventually broke out of its regional base around Cartagena and San Basilio to become a part of Colombian culture at large, much the same way that jazz spilled out of New Orleans and into the fabric of American culture. This compilation from Britain's Soundway records, co-compiled by label founder Miles Cleret and Colombia native (and owner of Palenque Records) Lucas Silva, offers a time-lapse of the evolution of this intercontinental fusion. Much as the soundsystem gave birth to ska and ultimately reggae in Jamaica, the roots of this music can be found in the picos, the local term for the Cartagena and Barranquilla soundsystems. The DJs that spun records for the picos were a resourceful bunch-- they played their share of local cumbias and other Colombian music, but they cut it with Caribbean music and hard-to-procure records from Africa, whipping up a gumbo of cumbia, compas, highlife, rumba, salsa, soukous, and funk that influenced what the musicians coming up listening to all of this would play on their own records. ""Burumburumbum"", by Casimbas Negras is practically geography-neutral. It has guitars that sound like they came off a record from Ghana, a snaking sax line that could have been recorded in Martinique, chanted vocals, and a jumpy rhythm that's part cumbia, part Afrobeat lockgroove. All up and down this set, the guitar playing is a joy-- a clear tone on the electric guitar was the preferred sound, and these guys aren't doing a lot of strumming or chicken-scratching. The lines they play are fluid and melodic, dueting or sometimes dueling with the singers, settling into sunny highlife patterns or cutting loose with an oddly psychedelic flourish. That's the other thing that's in no short supply here: experimentation. The vocal formula for this music was fairly consistent, with a lead engaging in a spirited dialogue with a chanting, repetitive chorus. But these bands and solo artists find so many combinations of rhythms and arrangements to wrap around that basic formula that it doesn't feel repetitive over the course of the full 21 tracks (23 on the 3xLP version). The experimentation is more overt on some tracks, with echo effects and odd guitar noises spicing up the hand percussion. Wganda Kenya has three songs here, and his have a strange flavor. ""El Lobo"" features rattles and buzzing synthesizer in its portentous intro, but it's actually not quite as strange as ""Pim Pom"", which is all voice and percussion until a wild electric organ part comes in, essentially soloing under the vocals. The organ sounds suspended in the middle of the mix, mingling neither with the percussion nor the vocals but effective all the same. His final track, ""Yoro"", is a slow, pretty highlife. It's one of a few downtempo tracks that balance the running order, offsetting frantic songs such as Abelardo Carbonó y su Conjunto's frantic ""Quiero a Mi Gente"", which sounds like hyper-speed Peruvian chicha music. At this point, it's almost unremarkable when another long-lost scene from some far-away corner of the world is unearthed and presented to the West in an easily digestible, well-produced compilation. If you're a global vintage pop junkie, it's become a matter of, ""Oh, of course tons of amazing music was made in this place at that time, and here it is, thanks to someone else's hard work and passion."" It almost feels like I should be bored or fatigued by it. But you know what? I'm not, and I think there's a stupidly simple reason for that: it's great music, and it fills a space, stylistically and sonically, that was previously empty.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14423-palenque-palenque-champeta-criolla-afro-roots-in-colombia-1975-91/,Soundway,2010.0,"If you're a fan of tropical music, then you can't miss out on the Palenque Palenque: Champeta Criolla & Afro Roots in Colombia 1975-91 album. This unique blend of champeta criolla and Afro roots is unlike anything you've heard before.

The story behind the album's creation is just as fascinating as the music itself. Palenque Records founder Lucas Silva traveled to the coastal city of Cartagena, Colombia in search of the intriguing African-influenced music that emerged in the region during the 1970s and 1980s. What he discovered is nothing short of remarkable: a hidden gem of Colombian music history that has finally been uncovered and presented to the world in this album.

Upon listening to the album for the first time, my ears were immediately drawn to the pulsating rhythms and the infectious energy that permeates throughout the tracks. The songs are like a blend of African rhythms with a Caribbean flavor, and are truly unique and entertaining.

One standout track on the album is ""La Negra Kulengue,"" which features Juancho Vargas and his group, Los Cumbiamberos de Pacheco. It's an upbeat and melodic song that's perfect for dancing, and it highlights the album's fusion of African and Caribbean musical elements.

For those who may be unfamiliar with champeta criolla and Afro roots music, there may be a bit of a learning curve. But once you dive in, you'll find that this album is a treasure trove of vibrant and exotic sounds that will keep you coming back for more.

The Aliens,Astronomy for Dogs,Rock,4.7,April 23 2007,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"The Beta Band were one of the most acclaimed Scottish bands of the late 1990s, bringing the bucolic to the iMac age. While their genre-agnostic indie-with-beats blew the minds of critics suffering from Oasis fatigue, it never quite caught on with the broader public, and by 2005 the group were no more. On Astronomy for Dogs, the Beta Band co-founder Gordon Anderson and former members Robin Jones and John Maclean revisit familiar psychedelic experiments, displaying impressive knowledge of pop's history but adding little to it themselves. Good as it is to have these dudes back, their reunion sounds disappointingly anticlimactic. The piano-splashed rock 'n' roll of upbeat first single ""The Happy Song"" indicates the guys are ""happy happy happy,"" but for an unapologetically stupid pop song it's damningly devoid of a decent hook-- let alone the stark beauty of the Kinks' ""Everybody's Gonna Be Happy"". Astronomy for Dogs opens with solo-spattered second single ""Setting Sun"", something like ""All Along the Watchtower"" with lyrics befitting the Chemical Brothers' homonymous 1996 single. What, too proud to call it a cover? The album is full of such moments where sonic reference trumps songwriting, a problem that also sometimes befalls other recent purveyors of record-collector rock like Band of Bees and the Earlies (if I mention Girl Talk I might get fired). The Aliens skip from the close Cyrkle harmonies and Del Shannon guitar arpeggios of plaintive kiss-off ""Tomorrow"" to join Midlake's 70s soft-rock revival on long-haired piano whimper ""Honest Again"". Token krautrock droner ""Only Waiting"" exhales India-scented melodies until tripping into a hyperactive ""I Am the Walrus""-meets-Psycho orchestral psyche-out. And so on. It's not that the Aliens are incapable of the pop fireworks that made the Beta Band a name classmates used to ask me about on their way back from High Fidelity. ""She Don't Love Me No More"" is a mild, string-enhanced take on towering Southern rock balladry, synth-laden ""Rox"" touches down for sidewalk-strutting funk, and kazoo-toting Merseybeat bouncer ""Glover"" intermittently morphs into a mean game of outer-space pinball. Still, even these songs sound more like imitations of past glory than new incarnations of the same pioneering spirit. The most ""Dry the Rain""-like track here, swooning anthem ""I Am the Unknown"", is perhaps illustrative of the Aliens' shortcomings. Picking up the weirdness of Anderson solo project Lone Pigeon, it's one of two songs on this album that end with the chanted reminder, ""We are the Aliens"". Two other songs shoot back, ""I am the Robot Man""-- and only one is future-funk breakdown ""Robot Man"". Whoever recorded Astronomy for Dogs, they're not the Beta Band anymore.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10020-astronomy-for-dogs/,"EMI,Pet Rock",2007.0,"As I delve into The Aliens' album ""Astronomy for Dogs"", I am immediately struck by the band's unique style and sound. This British band is made up of former members of the band Beta Band, and their experience is evident in the polished and well-crafted songs on this album.

The album's creation story is an interesting one, as it was recorded in a remote Scottish studio following the disbandment of Beta Band. The Aliens were determined to create something fresh and different, and this album is definitely an example of that. The band experiments with different sounds and genres, incorporating elements of psychedelia and classic rock into their music.

What stands out to me in this album are the intricate and complex guitar riffs, the compelling rhythms, and the cleverly written lyrics. The songs have a distinct, dreamlike quality to them that evokes a sense of wonder and mystery.

Listening to this album takes me on a journey, with each song bringing a different emotion and feeling. Some of my personal favorites include ""Setting Sun"", ""She Don't Love Me No More"", and ""Only Waiting"". These songs showcase the band's knack for creating catchy melodies and memorable hooks.

I do think that the album's rating of 4.7 out of 10 does not accurately reflect the quality of the music. While it may not be for everyone, I believe that ""Astronomy for Dogs"" is an underrated gem that deserves more attention.

In conclusion, The Aliens' ""Astronomy for Dogs"" is a captivating and imaginative album that showcases the band's talent for crafting intricate and experimental music. If you're a fan of rock music that pushes boundaries and takes risks, I highly recommend giving this album a listen.","1.

Paul Westerberg,Folker,Rock,7.2,September 13 2004,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"Throughout his career Paul Westerberg has always done his best work when expectations were lowest. Back in the fabled early days of The Replacements, his abundant songwriting skills always shone brightest whenever his audience was most justified in expecting a full-fledged drunken implosion. However, things went south for Paul once listeners began to recognize his genius and demand that he fulfill it by delivering unto us a tour de force, or at the very least a big record with hit singles. Record companies got into the act and threw him huge recording budgets and trips to the studio with the likes of Don Was, and our man buckled and began to poop out lifeless mediocrities like Don't Tell a Soul or Eventually. So in a way it was only too predictable what would happen after the commercial and artistic nadir of 1999's Suicaine Gratifaction chased off the remnants of his audience. With nobody listening and all pressure lifted, he went down to his basement and reclaimed his mojo on 2002's unvarnished double Stereo/Mono release and hasn't looked back since. Perhaps in part to further minimize the demands put on each individual album, Westerberg is now following one of Bob Pollard's most cherished songwriting axioms: If you can't always dazzle them with brilliance, stupefy them with productivity. (The idea being that it's a lot easier to forgive the occasional ""Silver Naked Ladies"" if you haven't waited three years to hear it.) Folker is Paul's fifth album of new material in the last two years, which is more output than he managed in the preceding 10. Adhering closely to the formula established on Stereo, the album again finds Westerberg all alone down in the rec room, muffing lyrics, gloriously airmailing guitar solos, playing the drums like he's doing the dishes, and generally having a fine time. In fact, there are moments when Folker reaches Vampire on Titus depths of fidelity, which probably qualifies it as his sloppiest recording yet, Grandpaboy or no. By now, though, we've all learned that if a Westerberg tune can't cut it in this environment, there's no amount of studio polish that'd have been able to fix it anyway. Things get off to an inauspicious start, with the banal one-note joke ""Jingle"" (""Buy it now, buy it now/ This is my single/ This is my jingle"") lasting at least twice as long as necessary despite its one-minute runtime. Thankfully, Westerberg recovers to settle into a nice hitting streak, bashing through effortlessly catchy songs like ""Looking Up in Heaven"" and the very GBV-ish ""As Far as I Know"" with an ease seldom heard since ""Waitress in the Sky"". There's a disarming simplicity and artlessness to these and other highlights like ""23 Years Ago"" and ""Gun Shy"", with an increased emphasis on persistent pop melody over crafty wordplay. This is fortunate since Folker is not Paul's strongest effort lyrically, with the quotable gems (""Bring a thimble and I'll pour my thoughts out"") just barely outnumbering the groaners (""I promise not to bug you/ Only just to hug you."") That's not to say the album is entirely without thematic heft. On the contrary, the album's emotional centerpiece is ""My Dad"", a tribute to Westerberg's recently deceased father that stands among the most nakedly heartfelt he's ever written. In hands less deft, a number like this could've become unbearably maudlin, but Westerberg's wry humor and painterly eye for detail (""He's never seen me play/ But he gets a kick from the newspaper/ When he sees the family name"") make it a stirring and poignant elegy, and when it closes with him repeating, ""My dad I love,"" it should bring a lump to the throat of even the most jaded ironyhound. Not even Westerberg's classic albums have been free of filler (unless you can honestly say you still get a kick out of ""Gary's Got a Boner"") and Folker has its fair allotment of pointless misfires like ""$100 Bride"", with its unfortunate chorus of, ""I promise not to leave the room/ Even if I've gotta vomit."" It's tracks like this one that'll drive you insane if you're deluded enough to think that Paul still has that flawless masterpiece in him somewhere. But if you've resigned yourself to the fact that we're always going to have to accept his periodic pearls of brilliance with a healthy side portion of flies in the sherbet, Folker should meet and possibly even exceed your expectations.

But before we dive into the album, let's take a closer look at the talented artist behind it all. Paul Westerberg is a true legend in the music industry, known for his exceptional work as the frontman of The Replacements. After the band disbanded, Westerberg continued to create music that was both honest and brave, often reflecting his own personal struggles and experiences.

""Folker"" is one such album, which was released in 2004. The album features some of Westerberg's best work, showcasing his distinctive voice and unique approach to rock music. The album was created as a collection of demos that Westerberg had recorded during different stages of his musical career, which he then refined and polished to make the final album. This gives the album a unique and intimate feel, as listeners are able to hear the raw and unfiltered sound of Westerberg's music.

As you listen to ""Folker,"" you can't help but feel the passion and dedication that went into its creation. Each song on the album has its own story to tell, and Westerberg's poetic lyrics paint a vivid picture of the emotions and experiences that inspired him. Songs like ""Wild and Lethal"" and ""Dangerous Boys"" are full of energy and vigor, featuring explosive guitar riffs and drum beats that will make you want to jump up and start dancing.

But it's not all high-energy rock on this album. Tracks like ""As Far As I Know"" and ""Sunrise Always Listens"" are tender and introspective, showing a different side of Westerberg's musical talent. His voice sounds gentle and vulnerable here, conveying a sense of sincerity and honesty that is truly captivating.

Overall, ""Folker"" is a fantastic album that showcases Paul Westerberg's exceptional talent and unique approach to rock music.

Noveller,No Dreams,Rock,7.2,December 6 2013,Marc Masters,Contributor,"It’s tempting to call any instrumental music “cinematic.” Without literal words to hook onto, most brains–or at least mine–fill in the blanks with images, especially since we’ve all seen so many movies do exactly that. But “cinematic” has become such a cliché that lately I’ve tried to block images out of my head when I listen to wordless music, in hopes that I’ll absorb and think about the sounds on their own–or at least not call them “cinematic”. I keep trying to do that with Noveller’s No Dreams, and I keep failing. I doubt that Sarah Lipstate, who records as Noveller, would have a problem with that, nor would she object to No Dreams being described as “cinematic.” She’s been working with film about as long as she’s been a musician, and lately she’s ramped up that side of her art significantly, crafting soundtracks for feature films and performing live scores on Radiolab’s tour. So she must have had some moving images in mind when she created the evocative, picture-worthy sounds on No Dreams. What makes No Dreams more than just “cinematic” is the way Lipstate straddles the line between literal and abstract. Her sounds drift from moments that conjure vivid mental movies to something more amorphous and undefined—more visceral than visual. According to press materials for No Dreams, these songs explore “blurred perception of reality and hallucination in the twilight of sleep and awakening.” The result is intoxicatingly hazy music, more fit for a half-remembered nightmare than a movie, with images flickering in and out of focus inside Lipstate’s shadowy soundscape. Previously, Lipstate built her soundscapes just with guitar and effects, but this time she’s added synth, beats, and other instrumental elements. Perhaps that’s why her music sounds a little denser and darker now, but really, those added elements are more accents than features. Guitar is still the only star of her show, and on No Dreams’ best tracks it becomes a kind of God around which other sounds congregate. On tracks such as the harrowing “Mannahatta” and the mournful “Gathering the Elements,” Lipstate coaxes high, celestial tones from her strings, at times making them sound like a kind of interplanetary bagpipe. That move becomes a motif, as many tracks crest whenever she ascends into trebly drone. It doesn’t quite create the narrative thrust that the last Noveller album, Glacial Glow, possessed. But it ties album into a focused, cohesive sonic whole. That brings up another cliché that I’m tempted to use to describe No Dreams. It’s as much atmospheric as it is cinematic, as much an environment to get lost in as a soundtrack to imagine pictures to. At this point “atmospheric” is an even more hackneyed descriptor than “cinematic,” but sometimes clichés are right. Sarah Lipstate creates miniature musical worlds, places that you feel like you’ll never leave long as the record is playing. Maybe her continually-strong work as Noveller can give some clichés a good name again.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18746-noveller-no-dreams/,Important,2013.0,"If you're a fan of mesmerizing and beautifully crafted Rock music, then you need to check out Noveller's latest album 'No Dreams.' This New York-based band has been making waves in the Indie Rock scene for years, and their latest album is a testament to their unique sound and undeniable talent.

Noveller is the brainchild of Sarah Lipstate, who is a talented multi-instrumentalist, composer, and soundscaper. She started Noveller out of necessity, as she wanted to create music that could stand alone, without the need for vocals. She started playing guitar at the age of 11 and has been refining her skills ever since. Sarah has a unique approach to music, focusing on weaving intricate soundscapes and utilizing the guitar as a tool for emotional expression.

'No Dreams' is the latest release from Noveller, and it's nothing short of a masterpiece. The album is a collection of eight tracks that take the listener on a journey of sonic exploration. From the opening track 'Rune' to the closing track 'Pre-fabled,' each song feels like a chapter of a larger story.

The album was created during the pandemic, which was a challenging time for many artists. However, Sarah used this time to her advantage, taking full control of the production and creation of the album. She recorded and mixed the album herself, which allowed her to bring her unique vision to life.

From my personal experience, I was blown away by the depth and emotion present throughout the album. The complexity of the soundscapes and the way each instrument was used to create a full and dynamic sound was impressive. The track 'Effektology' is a standout for me, as it featured a beautiful combination of layered guitars and soaring melodies.

Overall, 'No Dreams' is a must-listen for any Rock music fan. It's a unique and captivating listening experience that showcases the talent and vision of Noveller.

Agoraphobic Nosebleed,PCP Torpedo / AnbRX,Metal,6.0,June 27 2006,Zach Baron,,"Like most revolutionary forces, Agoraphobic Nosebleed didn't last long. Once crowned kings of the ultra-fast sweepstakes, their grindcore made their competition extinct by breaking the genre's essential rule: They canned their drummer and turned over the bpm to a drum machine. The Locust, Charles Bronson, even Discordance Axis-- helmed by the fastest living drummer, Dave Witte-- couldn't keep up. Then again: After a while, who really cared? Watching a needle skip, shake, and fly across full LP sides in seven minutes or less was an awesome but necessarily short-lived thrill. All that remains today of that era, for me anyway, is a ruined eBay account: I, er, a friend of mine, in those heady days, once totally ruined his online credibility by chasing (OK, bidding on) the original incarnation of PCP Torpedo-- a 6"" colored scrap of immediately out-of-print vinyl. These days, without context, those who encounter Agoraphobic Nosebleed generally act like people on hidden camera shows: nervously laughing, half credulous, and half already figuring out the exact ironic distance to maintain from a band that names a track ""A Clown Pointing a Gun at a Small Dog (Reprise)"". And did I mention PCP does its 10 songs in 6:32, about the time it takes to get to the first chorus in ""Freebird?"" But the joke, if there is one, isn't on you. Brainchild of Pig Destroyer's Scott Hull and the former Isis programmer J. Randall, Agoraphobic Nosebleed aren't hacks or comedians but dudes who know basic secrets like ""if it's fast, it might rip,"" and ""if we can write 17 three-second parts anytime we want, then why not put them all in the same song?"" PCP Tornado was the perfect length for Agoraphobic's exhausting calisthenics; at its best, as on ""Information Super Lost Highway"" and ""Thinning the Herd"", the record distilled a half-day's worth of breakdowns, cat-dog vocals, and whirring metal riffs down to the time it takes to snort a line of meth. In this respect, Agoraphobic acted as the exact opposite of the doom that's metal's current watchword: Where stoners take heaviness and mellow it enough to last the length of their high, Agoraphobic's grind condenses the experience, syncing it up to match, in feel anyway, the wealth of colorful pills that decorate their album art. If there is a joke here, it's how laughable the idea is of reissuing a suite of songs that are about half the total length any given song on Southern Lord. Cue then the dubious decision by Hydra Head to include a second disc-- the drug-punning ANBRX-- of remixes of Agoraphobic originals by industrial noise types. Why bother? Agoraphobic's formal innovation, as far as they had one, was just that: mating industrial noise and pseudo-breaks played off a drum-machine with a not-so-dissimilar grind that was already getting both noisier and more techno. In effect, they were already remixing their metal tracks, just in first draft form. Why put amphetamine rock on amphetamines? Nevertheless, Jansky Noise, Auek, Drokz & Tails, Hells Army, and a phalanx of others lean on pretty much that exact principle, relentlessly working the drum machine as if somehow Agoraphobic Nosebleed hadn't already done the exact same thing. More palpable are takes by Merzbow and Vinda Obmana, who depart from the script and instead make menacing, dark cloudy factory junk out of the dregs of the source material's adrenaline. And the combo of Dev/Null and Xanopticon at least take the drum machine to its logical extreme, turning their track into more-or-less pure breakbeats that sound amusingly like battling rats. But for a band that made what one critic once called ""the Paul's Boutique of grindcore,"" shouldn't they be the ones crafting the remixes?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11878-pcp-torpedoanbrx/,Hydra Head,2006.0,"When it comes to the world of metal, few bands bring as much ferocity and raw power as Agoraphobic Nosebleed. Their latest album, PCP Torpedo / AnbRX, is no exception, delivering a blistering onslaught of intense guitar riffs, thunderous drums, and guttural vocals that will leave you breathless.

For those who are unfamiliar with the band, Agoraphobic Nosebleed has been a staple of the metal scene for over two decades now, with a reputation for pushing the boundaries of the genre and creating music that is both brutal and innovative. They have always been unapologetic about their sound and lyrics, and that same spirit is reflected throughout PCP Torpedo / AnbRX.

What makes this album special is the way it was created. Rather than recording all the tracks together, the band decided to split the album in half, with each half featuring a different vocalist. The result is a unique and dynamic experience that showcases the versatility of Agoraphobic Nosebleed's musicianship.

The first half of the album, PCP Torpedo, features Kat Katz on vocals, who brings a fierce and abrasive energy to every track. From the opening moments of ""Not A Daughter"" to the closing growl of ""The Faint Smell of Wet Dog"", her voice commands attention and matches the intensity of the music perfectly. Tracks like ""Half Dead"" and ""Fuck You, Leroy"" are standouts, with their relentless riffing and breakneck speeds.

The second half, AnbRX, features Richard Johnson on vocals, whose style is more melodic and introspective. It's a stark contrast to the first half, but it works. Songs like ""Cocaine Avalanche"" and ""Deathbed"" have a haunting beauty to them, while ""As Bad As It Gets"" and ""Iron Fist"" deliver the same power and aggression as the first half.

Overall, PCP Torpedo / AnbRX is a solid metal album. It's not going to convert anyone who isn't already a fan of the genre, but for those who are, it's an excellent addition to your collection. The split vocals add a new dimension to the band's sound, and the musicianship is top-notch. While the album doesn't quite reach the heights of Agoraphobic Nosebleed's best work, it's still a worthy addition to their impressive discography.","1.

Simon Bookish,Everything/Everything,Pop/R&B,7.7,December 9 2008,Matthew Solarski,Contributor,"In a musical economy where ideas are the sole currency, Simon Bookish would be doing the Scrooge McDuck backstroke through a pool of cartoon coins right about now. The man's recordings abound in little innovations, both sonic and lyrical, and if Everything/Everything sounds particularly heavy on them, that's no coincidence: the record, a self-described ""big band song cycle,"" deals with the onslaught of information in this modern age. Accordingly, the music on Everything runs the gamut, with touches of kraut/motorik (""Portrait of the Artist as a Fountain"") and Gang of Four-descended post-punk (""Alsatian Dog"") rubbing up against plenty of Reich/Glass modular flourishes (a good two-thirds of the tracks) and even a splash of the baroque (""Il Trionfo del Tempo...[Ridley Road]""). Much has been made of Bookish's decision to eschew the electronic instrumentation that dominated his first two albums-- 2006's aggro-electro opus Unfair/Funfair and 2007's frequently brilliant if uneven Trainwreck/Raincheck-- in favor of the more organic sounds of the pianos, saxophones, Farfisa organs, harps, and chirpy brass section that color Everything. By and large Bookish employs his new toys to good effect: the polyphony of voice, backing chorus, piano, and brass during the refrain of opening track ""The Flood"" sounds positively euphoric, while ""Synchrotron"" drops thick, excited sax over rolling piano and a bed of Stereolab-like Farfisa to emerge as one of the record's highlights. This kitchen-sink musical approach makes sense in light of the subject matter, which, while it might not encompass everything, sure comes close. ""Carbon"" builds a chorus out of Albert Einstein's apparent words to Buckminster Fuller-- ""Young man, you amaze me!""-- tucked between imagery of various forms of the life-giving element. ""A Crack in Larsen C"" uses a disintegrating ice shelf as a springboard for a moody meditation on end times (""Will the future crash in the next five minutes/ And if it does, will we be burning or frozen?""), while ""Victorinox"" has Bookish seemingly commenting on the Swiss policy of neutrality one moment (""Try to ignore the drum sound...the place where you live is under attack"") and delighting in wordplay (""Monstrous animosity/ Rhinoceros of animus"") the next. Astronomy, television culture, publishing, oceanology, particle physics, and the evolution of language come into play as well, as do such fun vocab words as ""apogee,"" ""damask,"" and ""meniscus."" If this all sounds a little overwhelming, well, that's the point. Everything's one shortcoming is that it can occasionally feel cold and clinical, a feeling underscored by Bookish's authoritative baritone. That voice was slightly better suited to the stream-of-consciousness spoken word narratives on Trainwreck/Raincheck and the more sadomasochistic moments of Unfair/Funfair than to these avant-pop ditties. And despite Bookish's newfound penchant for pop song structures, his music still isn't nearly as accessible as that of fellow classically-trained tunesmiths Patrick Wolf and Owen Pallett/Final Fantasy-- which may explain his lower profile among fans of orchestral indie pop. And although it's unfocused by design, Everything is still unfocused. Which is not to say it's inconsistent: a major improvement in this regard over Trainwreck-- which meandered off into ambient oblivion on its final four tracks-- Everything is markedly well assembled. Its mellower material (""Il Trionfo"", ""Larsen C"") is deftly sequenced amid its peppier numbers, and ""The Flood"" and closing track ""Colophon"" serve as fine bookends for the whole concept. Indeed, it's the confusion and ambivalence that proceeds it that allows Bookish's final declaration on that closing track to ring loud and clear: ""Not too late to rewrite history/ Not too late to save ourselves/ Not too late to pull this species above, beyond."" Ultimately we're left with something not unlike the age it addresses: easily marveled at, not always so easily engaged with, and yet with much to offer to those willing to make the effort.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12480-everythingeverything/,Tomlab,2008.0,"If you're looking for an album that will make you feel all the things, look no further than Simon Bookish's ""Everything/Everything"". This pop/R&B album is a delightful combination of infectious beats, incredible production, and thought-provoking lyrics – it truly has it all.

Simon Bookish, also known as Leo Chadburn, is a British musician and composer. Chadburn has been producing music under the name Simon Bookish since 2004, and ""Everything/Everything"" is his fifth studio album. From the very first listen, it is clear that he has mastered his craft with this record.

""Everything/Everything"" was created through a unique process. The album is a song cycle that takes a deep dive into everyday life and human behavior. Each song represents a different day of the week, designed to capture the ups and downs of a typical week. The album encourages listeners to question why we do the things we do, who we do them for, and how we can break free from the monotony of our routines.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Friday"", which is a soulful and groovy ode to the end of the workweek. It's impossible not to feel a sense of relief and joy when listening to this track – it truly captures the feeling of finally being free from the demands of work. Another highlight is ""Monday"", a poignant track that examines the struggle of starting a new week and the temptation to continue living in the past.

The production on ""Everything/Everything"" is top-notch, with a great attention to detail. Everything from the instrumentation to the vocal arrangements is meticulously crafted. The album's sound is a perfect blend of pop, R&B, and electronic music. The lyrics are also incredibly well-written, with a consistent theme throughout the album.

Overall, I would give ""Everything/Everything"" a rating of 7.7 out of 10. While it has some truly incredible tracks, there are a few songs that fall a bit flat. However, when the album is at its best, it is truly phenomenal. I personally enjoyed the album from start to finish, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for an album that is both musically engaging and lyrically thought-provoking. Simon Bookish has truly created something special with this album, and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.","1.

Steve Aoki,Pillowface and His Airplane Chronicles,Electronic,2.5,February 20 2008,David Raposa,Contributor,"This mix, the first (and hopefully last) from Dim Mak major domo Steve Aoki, kicks off with Refused's ""New Noise"", a 10-year-old track that mixes Fugazi-loving ruckus with the merch-friendly electronic ambiance now heard on the quiet moments of your average Linkin Park single. After two minutes of this enjoyable ruckus, the disc jumps into a 16-track mix of modern-day post-punk and indie-approved dance tracks that I assume by the incongruous Refused intro is meant to signify the ""new noise"" of a 21st century American Apparelled rock/dance zeitgeist that's not at all played out in the slightest. Granted, this thing passes the American Bandstand test just fine, which is its primary purpose. That said, a broken dishwasher also has a beat to it, and sticking someone's gussied-up 1987 Maytag front and center at the trendiest L.A. hot spot would undoubtedly get both scene-stealers and scene-makers on the floor in time for a Cobrasnake photo op. So we have a guitar-flavored version of the boundary-busting credo offered in Green Velvet's ""Shake and Pop""-- ""I like electro/ I like retro/ I like ghetto/ House & techno""-- never mind that kicking those doors down in a Daft Punk world doesn't take all that much effort. That said, whenever Aoki tries to bring two (or three) purportedly great tastes together, the end result is the aural equivalent of mixing toothpaste and orange juice. In Aoki's mind, Mickey Avalon can offer a verse on a perfectly fine little electro squiggle like K.I.M.'s ""Wet 'N Wild"" without gumming up the works, while Pase Rock can pinch a horny-backpacker loaf on one of two Justice tracks and not sound like an assclown. For what it's worth, Pase does his business all over ""Waters of Nazareth""-- take a wild G.U.E.S.S. what the other Justice track is (and guess which indie-rooted RMXGRP worked their magic on it). Guests of similar quality pepper the disc, with only Kid Sister's turn atop ""Shake and Pop"" being worth a damn. Turns by the vocalists for Hot Hot Heat and the Faint come off more like extraneous cameos than the spotlight-grabbers they should be. If only other folks followed suit: Har Mar Superstar fronts like Licensed to Ill is the be-all and end-all of hip-hop, Spank Rocker Amanda Blank manages to make a turgid remix of Does It Offend You, Yeah? even worse, and Santogold damages one of the mix's more enjoyable tracks (""Licky [Work It Out]""), with her bargain-basement-Peaches turn at the mic. If you're the sort that accepts no substitutes, then you'll be happy to know that the original shows up on this thing as well, thanks to Weird Science, a remix duo featuring a member of Moving Units and a certain Mr. Aoki. Peaches emerges relatively unscathed on their manhandling of ""Boys Wanna Be Her"", but then there's her turn atop a castrated version of Bloc Party's ""Helicopter"". Weird Science take a perfectly fine guitar-driven track, strip out its frenetic drive, add a lumpy sea-sick strobe-bass beat, and put the track's focus entirely on Kele Okereke's and Peaches' vocals, because that's supposedly where the party is. After 50 minutes of this tired nonsense, with the highlights (like the bloops and bleeps of Yelle's thankfully untouched ""Je Veux Te Voir"", or the bits of Datarock's strummy ""Fa-Fa-Fa"" that aren't beset by hot hot air) sorely outnumbered by the lowlights, the mix ends with another turgid rock-meets-dance-with-guest remix, this time a track by Dim Mak group (and post-punk aficionados) Scanners with additional words of wisdom offered by Justice labelmate Uffie. By this point, whatever ""new noise"" Aoki seemed to promise at the start comes off as just futile sound and fury signifying the number of folks he has in his iPhone and/or under contract.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11167-pillowface-and-his-airplane-chronicles/,Thrive,2008.0,"Hey there, fellow music lovers! Today, I’m excited to dive into the unique and offbeat world of Steve Aoki’s “Pillowface and His Airplane Chronicles”. This album is unlike anything else in the electronic music genre, and it has garnered a lot of attention as a result. With a rating of 2.5 out of 10, it's clear that this album falls short in many areas, but it still has plenty of surprises in store for listeners.

Before we delve into the music itself, let's take a moment to talk about Steve Aoki’s long and illustrious career. Born in Miami, Florida, Aoki has become a force to be reckoned with in the electronic dance music scene. From his early days as part of the band This Machine Kills, to his solo career after the band’s dissolution, Aoki has always been unafraid of taking risks and blurring genres. And that spirit of experimentation is certainly evident in “Pillowface and His Airplane Chronicles”.

The album itself is a masterpiece of electronic goodness, blending synth-heavy beats with ethereal vocals and a mix of other sounds that are hard to put a label on. From the opening track “Intro” to the final tracks “Heartbreaker” and “I'm in the House”, the album takes you on a journey that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Even as someone who is not particularly fond of the electronic music genre, I was pleasantly surprised by how catchy and engaging the songs were.

One of the most interesting aspects of Aoki's music is his use of imaginative sampling. On “Pillowface and His Airplane Chronicles”, we hear a range of sounds and samples, from snippets of dialogue to the sound of buzzing bees. This makes for a really unpredictable and enjoyable listening experience.

However, as much as I enjoyed the creativity and risk-taking in this album, there were some areas where it falls short. For starters, the album’s biggest downfall is its lack of cohesiveness. Each track seems to exist in its own world, with its own unique sound and style. While this is cool in theory, it ultimately makes for a meandering and disjointed listening experience.

Additionally, some songs feel like mere throwaways, lacking in the sonic and emotional depth that we come to expect from Aoki. ""I’m in the House"" attempts to compensate for this by bringing in a guest appearance by rapper Zuper Blahq, but ultimately, the track falls flat.

Overall, “Pillowface and His Airplane Chronicles” is an album that’s worth checking out for its daring and imaginative approach to electronic music. While it doesn't always hit the mark, there are plenty of moments that will leave you feeling exhilarated and inspired. Give it a spin and let us know what you think!","1.

Morgan Geist,Unclassics,"Electronic,Pop/R&B",8.4,January 20 2005,Mark Pytlik,Contributor,"The combination of the electronic dance music community's restored appetite for disco with a more general 80s wanderlust has opened the door for a minor Italo disco rediscovery (pleasant side effect: a less hostile attitude towards camp). Not surprisingly, a handful of Italo-themed compilations have been issued in the past 12 months; only a few have been as fun, as revelatory and as representative as Unclassics. Selected, mixed, and bankrolled entirely by Metro Area's Morgan Geist, this mix follows in the tradition of the Environ label head's lovingly deployed Unclassics vinyl releases, which themselves were sort of dust-off and rescue missions for the waylaid orphans of the Italo boom. Cherry-picked and sorta-mixed by Geist himself, the tracks on this continuous set are strung together by all the things that made Italo interesting, namely a sense of goofiness, color, and theatre. To that end, Italo represents the furthest functional extreme from dance music's other current fascination-- microhouse; in the interest of balance and perversity, it makes sense that both should be dominating dance music's discourse at same time. Almost uniformly un-self conscious, Unclassics amounts to a seven-course spread of opulent synths, syrupy melodies, and joyously over-the-top vocal performances. Dance Reaction's ""Disco Train"" is sung by an adenoidal Cameo-soundalike, Victor's ""Go On Do It"" is a campy call-and-response that has slavering raps buzzing up against a female's breathy refrains, and Pluton & Humanoids' ""World Invaders"" contains an opera diva and a vocoded robot anxiously engaging in some sort of epic Wellesian struggle between man and machine (their resolution: duet!) The highlight of the mix is probably Geist's own Hot Edit of Margueritas' shimmering ""Margherita"", which strips it of its made-for-Eurovision vocals and recasts it as an ever zippier ""Popcorn"". Drenched in peppy analog pings, handclaps, and Mexican horns, it's one of the most ridiculously infectious dance tracks in recent memory. Also good is Eurofunk's ""Manshortage"", which deploys a liquid guitar line over a weird, spindly little electro groove. Come to think of it, the only thing that really approaches disco orthodoxy is the twirling strings of the Purple Flash Orchestra's penultimate ""Freedom Now""-- and even that is quickly upended by Gaz Nevada's oddball eight-minute closer, ""Special Agent Man."" It's a weird collection of oblong disco, to be sure, and repeated listens do nothing to diminish its freshness and off-kilter appeal. Credit's due to Geist, not just for being prescient enough to release these tracks at the right time, but for swooping down to rescue them in the first place. Even if it is hard to believe that anybody could ever forget source material like this.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3664-unclassics/,Environ,2004.0,"Morgan Geist's ""Unclassics"" is a mesmerizing mix of electronic, pop, and R&B that will have you hooked from the very first beat. With a rating of 8.4 out of 10, it's no wonder that this album has been making waves in the music industry. Throughout the album's 10 tracks, Geist delivers a fusion of genres that's both satisfying and refreshing, showcasing his distinct musical style that's been honed over years of experience.

For those unfamiliar with Geist's work, he's a musician, producer, and DJ hailing from New Jersey who's been active in the music scene for over two decades. He's well-known for his contributions to the rise of electronic music in the US, with classic tracks like ""Most of all"" and ""24K"" cementing his status as a respected and innovative artist.

With ""Unclassics"", Geist brings together a collection of tracks that he's been working on for years, imbuing each one with a unique energy that's impossible to resist. From the groovy basslines of ""Mega"" to the smooth vocals of ""Darkstar"", each song delivers its own sonic experience that's both cohesive and distinct.

What makes this album truly stand out, however, is Geist's willingness to experiment with different genres and sounds. Tracks like ""Manhattan"" and ""Skyblue Pink"" showcase a pop and R&B influence that's hard to ignore, while songs like ""ATA"" and ""Swoon"" deliver an electronic edge that's both powerful and captivating.

As someone who's been a fan of Geist's work for years, I was excited to listen to ""Unclassics"" and it didn't disappoint. The album has been on non-stop replay since I first heard it, with each listen revealing more layers and nuances that I missed before. If you're a fan of electronic music or simply looking for something new and exciting, ""Unclassics"" is definitely an album you need to check out.

Various Artists,Our Lives Are Shaped By What We Love: Motown's MoWest Story 1971-1973,,7.8,June 8 2011,David Drake,Contributor,"Frankie Valli was one of the most successful pop artists of the 20th century. In addition to a successful solo career, his work with the Four Seasons resulted in an incredible 71 chart hits; more than half of these made the Top 40, and eight of them topped the charts. His hit-making prowess even bucked the album-oriented trends of the Sgt. Pepper's era, but there were some hiccups along the way. One of the most notable was a stint with Motown's short-lived MoWest imprint in the early 1970s, where Valli found himself in a slump. After a few disappointing swings at the charts, Valli tried to release ""My Eyes Adored You"" in 1974. MoWest passed on the record. Valli released the song late that year as a solo artist on Private Stock Records, and it topped the Billboard Hot 100 by March of the following year, ending the artist's stint on the label and kickstarting a new era of success. This story is a microcosm of MoWest's inauspicious reign as the forgotten moment of one of the most iconic labels in the history of pop. The creation of the imprint was part of Berry Gordy Jr.'s gradual shift of Motown operations from Detroit to Los Angeles, away from the assembly-line production of the label's peak years. The Holland-Dozier-Holland team had already departed, replaced in part by Norman Whitfield and a raft of superstar auteurs: Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, and Diana Ross. The shift to Los Angeles also marked the end of the singular Detroit sound, as the label became reliant on a rotating cast of session musicians. But even with all the upheaval, it's difficult to figure out why MoWest fell through the cracks; the music contained in Our Lives Are Shaped By What We Love: Motown's MoWest Story 1971-1973 is almost uniformly great. The compilation showcases a wide range of notable artists-- a 1971 Billboard article notes the label's purpose was to ""expand Motown's musical horizons""-- at varying stages in their careers. It was an indisputably exciting time, creatively, for soul music, in the years before disco became a codified sound. Stevie Wonder, near the beginning of his incredible decade-plus solo creative run, does make a behind-the-scenes appearance on this compilation, producing the tracks from Syreeta's debut LP. Both are highlights. Odyssey, not to be confused with the disco group of the same name, contribute three songs; each, but particularly the uptempo flute-laden horn-driven dance number ""Battened Ships"", is a compelling example of a kind of post-hippie spiritual 70s soul. There are also early career appearances from future superstars the Commodores and Thelma Houston, whose ""I Ain't Going Nowhere"" includes an inspired vocal performance. Rock group Lodi, on the other hand, may have marked an attempt on Motown's part to move towards a psychedelic-cum-acid-folk sound, but their ""I Hope I See It in My Lifetime"" feels aimless, without the kind of memorable songwriting that defines the bulk of this compilation. Perhaps the best moment on the collection is one of the record's best-known, at least to American dance floors. Although still an obscure cut by any reasonable standard, the Sisters Love's ""Give Me Your Love"" manages to completely reinvent Curtis Mayfield's original. With its heart-damaged vocals, the song manages a rare balance of driven vulnerability over an endless, inimitable groove. It's a strong document of the pre-disco era, but also an example of one way these oddities could endure (in this case, seeing a resurgence in a later floor-friendly edit), whatever its chart success. The primary common denominator here is that none of these artists sold well at the time. (MoWest's one hit in the United States, Tom Clay's ""What The World Needs Now Is Love"", is not included.) But whatever the commercial obstructions, the music certainly holds up.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15514-our-lives-are-shaped-by-what-we-love-motowns-mowest-story-1971-1973/,Light in the Attic,2011.0,"Let me start off by saying that I have been a huge fan of Motown music for years, and the MoWest Story 1971-1973 album did not disappoint. This unique album features a variety of songs from a variety of artists, all showcasing their talent and the evolution of Motown music during this era.

The MoWest Story is a compilation of tracks that were recorded during a tumultuous time in the history of Motown Records. In the early 1970s, Motown Records was looking to expand its sound and reach, and so they created MoWest Records. This label was based out of Los Angeles and focused on a more diverse range of musical styles, including funk, rock, and soul.

The album tells a story of this era with a variety of talented artists such as Syreeta Wright, Willie Hutch, and Frankie Valli, who were given the freedom to experiment with new sounds and styles. The result is an album that is a masterclass in musicianship and songwriting.

One of my favorite songs on the album is Syreeta Wright's ""I Love Every Little Thing About You."" It's a soft and romantic track that showcases Syreeta's beautiful vocals and the expert instrumentation that MoWest was known for. Another standout song is Willie Hutch's ""Brothers Gonna Work It Out."" This track is a powerful funk-infused call to action that is as relevant today as it was when it was recorded over forty years ago.

The album is a solid representation of how Motown's MoWest Records influenced the evolution of music during this era. The arrangements of the songs are complex, with layers of instrumentation that showcase the talent of the artists and the care that went into the production of the tracks.

Overall, the MoWest Story 1971-1973 album is a must-listen for anyone who appreciates the history of Motown music and the evolution of music during this era. The compilation offers a diverse range of tracks that showcase the unparalleled musicianship of the artists and the influence of MoWest Records on the music industry.

Jessie Jones,Jessie Jones,Rock,6.9,August 10 2015,Tess Duncan,Contributor,"On her debut LP, California singer-songwriter Jessie Jones advises her listeners ""And all the mystery is over a fear that by letting/ Go of love it'll feel like an ending/ Give it away/ It'll come back when you're ready."" This sanguine, if-you-love-something-let-it-go philosophy is in line with her career. She's traded in leading the charge for garage-rock quintet Feeding People to actualize her visions of radiant pop grandeur. It's a smooth transition for Jones, whose versatility as a vocalist alone is enough to warrant her place in the spotlight. On her solo release, she comes across as the best advocate you could have for not taking shit from anyone. But she also spins intoxicating tales that reveal her spiritual perspective on life. Her hippie-influenced outlook is partially why her name has been mentioned in the same breath as Janis Joplin, but her syrupy mew is closer in sound to indie-pop peer Alex Winston. Opener ""Sugar-Coated"" recalls a King Con-era Winston, as Jones builds the sprightly pop song with her deceivingly innocent voice before skyrocketing to carry the anthemic chorus. She plays with tension and release vocally on the rapturous ""Lady La De Da"". Mottled with giddy tambourines and spattering drum fills, the album is a little bipolar in its approach to instrumentation, but it isn't messy. ""Quicksilver Screen"" is anchored by jangly riffs, letting a squealing synth lead drop into deeper, wonkier ones that bob up and down with resilience. Jones flirts with brassier proclivities on ""Twelve Hour Man"", as rollicking horns steal the show, racing jazzy percussion and fluttering piano chords to the finish line. Closer ""Mental Illness"" is the album's biggest outlier but also one of its biggest successes. Suddenly we're placed in Jones' bedroom, as she nearly whispers in your ear, ""My mental illness/ There's nothing wrong with it/ Sick of my feelings, tired of faking it/ Crying so hard, I can't explain it."" She repeats this over a few bare riffs until her singing smudges into echoes. It's a stark jump from the up-to-mid-tempo psych-pop that precedes it, but it's a self-titled record for a reason. Jones wants to give her all, even if her moment of vulnerability is only a brief glance. ""La Loba"" is another anomaly, though a less severe one. It's a flamenco song that feels like an ancient fable put to music. Jones' voice snakes luxuriously around a few low, slick chords, a violin weeping. She grows increasingly desperate and unrelenting as the track builds, howling across zipping guitar lines, the pressure bubbling over like a pot of boiling water. It's a testament to the formidable range she never got a chance to fully realize during her time in Feeding People. Jessie Jones is a well-rounded introduction, one that holds little back. When asked about her personal philosophy, Jones is frank. ""Love yourself and speak your truth. I believe in individualism, I'm not anything but who I am is only something I live with."" This album's inconsistencies are deliberate. Without them, she would be presenting a false identity, an incomplete version of herself. With them, we can more fully work toward understanding Jessie Jones, the individual.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20883-jessie-jones/,Burger,2015.0,"If you're looking for some fresh and exciting rock music, then you better not miss out on Jessie Jones' latest self-titled album. Coming in at a rating of 6.9 out of 10, there's plenty to love here for fans of the genre. With her unique voice and energetic guitar melodies, Jessie Jones brings a unique twist to the rock genre, and this album is a testament to her undeniable talent.

But before we dive into the music itself, let's talk a bit about the band's history and the album's creation story. Jessie Jones is no stranger to the music scene, having been a prominent member of the SoCal rock band Feeding People in the early 2010s. After the band disbanded, Jessie continued to hone her skills as a solo artist, releasing her debut album in 2015.

For this self-titled follow up album, Jessie Jones teamed up with producer Infamous Joe, who had previously worked with artists such as Best Coast and FIDLAR. The result is a cohesive and polished album that showcases Jessie's growth as an artist.

When listening to this album, it's clear that Jessie Jones has poured her heart and soul into each and every song. From the frenetic energy of ""Quicksilver Screen"" to the introspective ballad ""Make It Spin"", there's a wide range of emotions and styles on display here. It's also worth noting that Jessie's voice is an absolute standout - her unique tone and phrasing brings a certain magic to every track.

As for personal experience and opinions, I can confidently say that this album is an absolute joy to listen to. While it may not reinvent the wheel when it comes to rock music, Jessie Jones' self-titled album offers plenty of fresh ideas and unique touches that make it stand out from the pack. Tracks like ""Waiting For Something"" and ""How Long"" are sure to get your blood pumping, while ""Quicksilver Screen"" and ""La Loba"" offer a more atmospheric and introspective take on the genre. 

In conclusion, I highly recommend Jessie Jones' self-titled album to anyone who loves rock music. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the genre or simply looking for some new music to get into, this album has something for everyone. Jessie Jones has proven herself to be a talented and versatile artist, and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.","1.

Haruomi Hosono,Hosono House,"Electronic,Pop/R&B",7.6,October 3 2018,Kevin Lozano,Contributor,"In the early 1980s, the Japanese singer, bassist, and producer Haruomi Hosono created an idea he called “sightseeing music.” It is a mode of making and listening that asks both creators and consumers to think of themselves as musical tourists, soaking up the sights and sounds of foreign cultures with an open mind and documenting them through personal translations. This peripatetic strategy ignored walls between genres and operated with an ethos of open borders and freewheeling hybridity. This concept powered a catalog of near-encyclopedic breadth. New Orleans funk, Okinawan folk, big-band swing, Bollywood bop, jazz fusion, acid-house chaos: A true musical polymath, Hosono has explored it all. Hosono, now in his 70s, remains a titan in his country’s musical history, but he does not strike such a towering figure abroad. Still, the impact of his vision has rippled across vast musical distances, making him perhaps the only artist whose sphere of tangible influence includes Derrick May, Afrika Bambaataa, Duran Duran, Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, and Mac DeMarco. With his techno-pop group Yellow Magic Orchestra, Hosono helped pioneer sounds that shaped modern techno, hip-hop, and synth-pop. While Yellow Magic’s influence is unimpeachable (if underrated), Hosono’s role before and after the band’s pioneering run lingers in the margins. That’s partially because the bulk of his solo work has never been available in the United States, so his brilliance felt like a secret for record collectors and YouTube spelunkers. But a series of long-awaited reissues from Light in the Attic documents a five-album stretch from 1973 to 1989 that offers a revelatory glimpse at a mere sliver of his dizzying discography. At last, Hosono can step toward deserved international attention. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hosono helped foster a local folk music scene in Tokyo’s Shibuya coffee shops. One of his bands at the time, Happy End, became the first Japanese rock group to sing exclusively in the native tongue, teasing out how to bend the idiosyncrasies of the language around Western rhythms. This alone is a career-defining achievement, but Hosono was rapaciously creative. After the band broke up in 1973, he and a group of musicians called Tin Pan Alley (a kind of Japanese answer to Phil Spector’s “Wrecking Crew” of ace session players) rented a pad an hour from Tokyo. While there, they recorded Hosono House, an album of what Hosono called “virtual American country”—a sort of Japanese emulation of Americana. In the chunky rhythms of “Bara to Yaju” and the honky-tonk swing of “Fuyu Goe,” you can hear how careful and considerate he was of the musical vernaculars he sourced. Hosono House instantly establishes a thread through this line of reissues: Hosono had a concrete belief in the plasticity of genre. In his singular focus on the mutable, he was able not only to inhabit different genres but bend them to his will. Hosono’s albums suppose you can travel entire musical worlds in a single sitting, or you can at least take a trip somewhere you’ve never been. On 1978’s Paraiso, he brings you on a tour of the world’s tropics, crafting lounge pop songs so elegant and languorous they should be heard with a fruity drink in hand. The album is the first to feature his Yellow Magic bandmates—Ryuichi Sakamoto and Yukihiro Takahashi. On their “Femme Fatale” (unrelated to the Velvet Underground), the caws of tropical birds, Sakamoto’s lush Rhodes chords, and Takahashi’s paradisical acoustic drums coalesce into a rich oceanside scene. Yellow Magic, which emerged soon after Paraiso, was intended as a one-off critique of the exocticism and Orientalism of Western visions of Asian music. (Their loving target was Martin Denny’s “Firecracker,” which led to a cover more famous than the original.) The beginnings of that intellectual engagement become clear here. The same year, Hosono released a radically different record, Cochin Moon, a synth-and-sequencer fantasia that recreated the uneasy feeling of his month-long trip to India alongside legendary Japanese visual artist Tadanori Yokoo. Hosono hoped for the album to be an ethnographic work of field recordings, like the flutes of snakecharmers or the recitations of the religious. But two unforeseen events waylaid him: First, Yokoo introduced Hosono to Kraftwerk, a central influence on the electronic backbone of this record and Yellow Magic’s subsequent debut. Hosono also contracted a stomach illness, the diarrhea producing a delirium so intense he felt he was near death. Cochin Moon is a hallucinatory listen. Though the music is informed by Bollywood soundtracks and traditional Indian touches, the clear disorientation of his sickness is embodied in each synth pulse and distended vocal. On “Hepatitis,” the synths sound simultaneously like bubbling cauldrons, malfunctioning zippers, and manic music boxes, an overload meant to make you woozy. That unfiltered mood gives the record an almost-shocking quality. Those first synth explorations would flower with Yellow Magic Orchestra. In 1982, during one of the band’s hiatuses, Hosono took it a step further with Philharmony. It elevated the rudimentary technology of sampling into avant-garde expression. Listing a Prophet-5 synth, LinnDrum drum machine, MC-4 sequencer, and the early Emulator sampler as his “guest performers,” Hosono used Philharmony as an opportunity to test the limits of recording technology. He described the process of sampling, looping, and rewiring his breaths, vocals, and instruments into what feel like cubist shapes as improvisatory painting. Listening means surfing a circuit board one moment and spending an evening at a robot-run opera the next. Alongside all this cybertronic experimentation were funny 16-bit funk songs (on “Living-Dining-Kitchen,” he sings about his love of junk food) and straight-up synth-pop killers like the wonderful “Sports Men.” It still feels groundbreaking. After the Yellow Magic Orchestra broke up for the first time some seven years later, Hosono fully established his theory of “sightseeing music” on omni Sight Seeing, a clear refutation of the homenogizing phenomenon of “world music.” His inveterate genre-hopping takes us between the acid-house epic “Laugh-Gas” and the Steve Reich-inspired keyboard exploration “Orgone Box,” between the ambient experiment “Korendor” and the bizarro pop of “Pleocene.” Other songs reference Algerian raï and American swing. A winking eccentricity flows through it all, as if Hosono saw each trope he encountered as another card in a deck, ready to be shuffled and made into the stuff of magic tricks. This unabashed love of trying new things without fear of failure is what makes Hosono’s catalog so delightful even now. In these five albums, we’re only given a snapshot of his 21 solo records, but the wizard-like inventiveness displayed here spotlights why Hosono should be considered a major figure. Taken together, these reissues represent a partial shadow history for the slow breakdown of genre boundaries. Nearly half a century after Hosono House, it’s easy to take for granted how permeable once-distinct zones have become. But rule breakers like Hosono, however overlooked they became, had to first do the hard work that’s so lovingly documented here.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/haruomi-hosono-hosono-house-paraiso-cochin-moon-philharmony-omni-sight-seeing/,"Light in the Attic,Light in the Attic,Light in the Attic,Light in the Attic,Light in the Attic",1973.0,"Welcome to the innovative and genre-defying world of Haruomi Hosono's ""Hosono House"". The album itself combines elements of electronic, pop/R&B, and a bit of rock; but there's more to it than just that. This is a masterpiece that was created by someone who truly understands music on a different level.

First off, let's talk about the man behind the music: Haruomi Hosono. He's a prolific musician and producer who's been active in the industry since the 1970s. If you're not familiar with Hosono, he was a founding member of the Yellow Magic Orchestra, a trailblazing electronic band that played a pivotal role in shaping the sound of modern music. Hosono's work with YMO and beyond has inspired countless artists in the decades since, and ""Hosono House"" is a perfect example of why that is.

Now, to the album itself. ""Hosono House"" starts off with ""Rock-A-Bye My Baby"", a soft and melodic with a hint of electronic sound that sets the mood for the entire album. I was truly amazed by the amount of depth and complexity evident in all of the songs on the album. The songs themselves are crafted with care and attention to detail, with each element of the music combining to create a sound that is unique and unforgettable.

As for personal experience and opinions, I really loved this album. I'm a big fan of the electronic pop sound, but this album takes it to a whole new level that I never knew existed. Every song is a journey in and of itself, and I found myself completely captivated by the album's unique blend of sounds from start to finish.

In conclusion, ""Hosono House"" is an absolute masterpiece that has stood the test of time. The combination of electronic, pop/R&B, and rock elements is nothing short of genius, and Haruomi Hosono's mastery of music is evident throughout the entire album. If you're a fan of any of those genres, this is an album you absolutely must check out. I would give it a rating of 8.5 out of 10.","Review A is the human written review.

DNA,DNA on DNA,"Experimental,Rock",8.1,August 4 2004,Chris Dahlen,,"Question for the young'uns who are studying DNA for the first time: Sure, DNA mattered, but were they any good? ""no-wave"" (genre): The stunted strand of noise music/performance art where amateurs played fast, disjointed jerks of songs with no development, making vulgar and even physical assaults on audiences who would've settled for being spat on. Immortalized as much for how quickly it burned out as for how many bands it still influences, no-wave is mostly remembered by a single milestone, No New York, produced by Brian Eno, who picked the four bands that had the best names: James Chance & The Contortions, Teenage Jesus & The Jerks, Mars, and DNA. All of DNA's studio tracks and a handful of live ones are here, even the four songs from No New York. Everyone refers to No New York as one of the great out-of-print albums, but if you look around, you can buy it on CD for about $40. But that would be really stupid. Damn, Francis Crick just died. People joke that if you've heard one DNA song, you've heard them all, but you really need at least two: one with keyboardist Robin Lee Crutchfield, and another with his vastly more capable replacement, Pere Ubu bassist Tim Wright. Robin Crutchfield, writing on his website about one of his first gigs, in 1976 at a performance art festival: ""I mapped out a perimeter on the Floyd Bennett airfield runway with a stick of chalk and took several objects including a toy piano and a blanket with me to live in a self-imposed cage like an asylum inmate for the day. 'The Death of Sparrow Hart' was a persona I took on, part bird, part autistic child, dancing and sobbing and pecking at the piano, hiding under a blanket and so on."" The single biggest reason to revisit DNA is noise savant Arto Lindsay. Lindsay chicken-chokes his guitar, splintering notes and shattering chords like windows falling out of a skyscraper. He cracks his vocals like a bullwhip, then garbles his lyrics with the patience of dry heaving. ""Get out of here/ Go fuck yourself,"" he moans, then sticks his head back in the bowl. When a woman suffers a miscarriage, a common cause is genetic damage: The egg and sperm unite but the DNA combines incorrectly, causing chromosomal damage that is too severe to allow the fetus to come to term. Children who are born with mental retardation also suffer genetic irregularities, but landed right at the threshold where the damage did not prevent them from coming to term. Going off the tracklist here, Blonde Redhead could've just named themselves Egomaniac's Kiss instead. Drummer Ikue Mori can't or won't lock in with anybody. Her frantic cymbal-bashing works better than when she tries to keep the beat-- which is fine, since the rhythms are numbing. As for when she pounds out a tribal tattoo, if you were sacrificing your daughter to a volcano and Mori were the best drummer you could hire for the ceremony, you'd really feel like an asshole. Crutchfield on how they got Mori on drums: ""Arto wanted her to be our drummer. I was reluctant, for a number of reasons. The first was that she had played violin and had no experience on drums. The second was that she didn't own any drums. The third was that she didn't speak enough English for us to communicate and manage to build a 20 minute set of songs in less than 30 days. And the fourth was that her visa was expiring and she was planning to leave the country... She did have one thing going for her. She was interested in working with us."" Is it true that no-wave bands couldn't play their instruments? With the benefit of hindsight, you can figure out who had talent and who just had attitude, but no-wave is still remembered as a lost oasis of committed, crippling unprofessionalism, of a simpler time when making inept noise with gusto actually could shake someone-- except of course, how inept could it be if it's still worth listening to on a record, in your living room? Lindsay and Mori later worked with cult composer and improviser John Zorn, for example in the ""game improvisation"" Cobra, where Zorn herded his groups through painfully elaborate rules to produce music that sounds even uglier than this stuff. The nerdification of noise music suggests that for all the posturing and the awareness of posturing that surrounded no-wave, the downtown scenesters really lost something when it just became ""skronk."" Lindsay et al had the sense to kill the project instead of developing it. Arto Lindsay went on to become a fine singer and guitarist, and when he isn't playing extreme improv, he records beautiful albums of Brazilian pop. Meanwhile, Mori switched to drum machine.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2568-dna-on-dna/,No More,2004.0,"The experimental rock genre has yet another remarkable member - DNA. Comprised of Arto Lindsay on guitar and vocals, Ikue Mori on drums, and Tim Wright on bass, the band's sound is a mixture of punk rock and avant-garde.  With their album ""DNA on DNA,"" they continue to push the boundaries of music-making.

When listening to ""DNA on DNA,"" I could hear the band's unique sound shine through each track. The title itself serves as a clue into their creative process and what to expect from the album. It's a self-titled album that ultimately encompasses the essence of their identity as a band. The opening track, ""Egomaniac's Kiss,"" sounds like an outtake from The Velvet Underground album if they had continued on their avant-garde path. Lindsay's throaty vocal performance and heavy guitar riffs complement Mori and Wright's rhythm section. ""Blonde Red Head"" follows next, and it has to be one of my favorite songs from the album. With its catchy chorus and punk rock delivery, it's the perfect example of how DNA blurs the lines between styles and creates something entirely their own.

While each track is unique in its sound, the songs come together to form a cohesive whole. As I listened, I found myself immersed in the sonic world they created. The experimentation in their music never lost its musicality and catchy hooks that keep the listener engaged throughout the album. ""New Fast"" is another catchy tune that still sounds fresh decades later. There is a sense of urgency in their music, embodied in the lyrics and the driving rhythm. The final track, ""Not Moving,"" is the most experimental and stretches the boundaries of what rock music could be. Lindsay's spoken-word performance sounds like a stream of consciousness, and Mori's drumming feels like it's leading the way only to dissolve into noise and feedback that end the album on a thought-provoking note.

In conclusion, ""DNA on DNA"" is a remarkable album that showcases the musical vision of DNA. It is a fusion of experimental rock, punk rock, and avant-garde, all wrapped up in one sophisticated package. The musicianship on this album is extraordinary, with each member contributing their own unique style to create something entirely their own. If you're a fan of experimental music or you're looking for something that pushes the boundaries, ""DNA on DNA"" is an album worth owning.

Mahjongg,Kontpab,"Experimental,Rock",7.9,February 11 2008,Jason Crock,,"For as long as indie drummers have been riding hi-hats, Mahjongg have taken up the noble mission of keeping their home city weird. No one knows exactly what to expect from any given performance of theirs, and they've kept up the struggle of cultivating that spontaneity on record-- which has proven a much more difficult task. On their first EP, Machinegong, they were plastic pop purveyors, afro-poppers, dance-punkers, and whatever else the hell they felt like; scattered as the styles might have been, they struck an incredible balance on that first EP that they've less successfully charted on the records that have followed. But I can't blame them for not readily turning out another ""Aluminum"" or ""Hot Lava"". It must be chafing to be lumped in with the masses of one-trick ponies when Mahjongg were one of the only bands toying with beats from around the globe, not just early-eighties England. Now with the distance of a few years' time, we can hear how far apart Mahjongg are from the trend-- queasier, druggier, far more adventurous, and less likely to edit. Opener ""Pontiac"" plays with polyrhythms to get heads bobbing, starting out sounding like Konono no. 1 before arriving on a thick early 80s syncopated boom-bap. ""Problems"" gets more interesting and more seasick in its wobbling keyboard tones, and by the time the chimes come in near the end, its downtempo bounce sounds like a cousin to LCD Soundsystem's ""Someone Great"", like the early-morning hangover to that track's bittersweet euphoria. But there's plenty of moments where they're staking their own trail, far from what any similar artist might be doing. ""Tell the Police the Truth"" implores honesty in the face of legal confrontation, but you can't help but read sarcasm over its pounding doorknocker beats and myriad laser effects. It's part of Kontpab's strong middle section, bolstered by ""Those Birds Are Bats"", the track that shakes off any of the album's prior restraint as the singer belts out his most melodic turn and the drummer pounds out a 4/4 on the bass drum in heaving release. ""Wipe Out"" is perhaps too stiff and amelodic, reminiscent of some of the aimless experiments that dragged down Raydoncong 2005. The following track ""Teardrops"" is equally stiff, but far more layered and bewildering. Both this and ""Mercury"" seem to toy with modern minimal r&b-- ""Mercury"" more explicitly, as it's led by warbling vocals that follow the nimble two-step of the keyboards while alien chimes hover above it all. But closer ""Rise Rice"", for lack of a better word, is bonkers-- more polyrhthyms, more scary noises, and more drums that sound like the world is ending mark the band's own blazing, singular path. It's clearly the most stunning moment on an album that's stylistically all over the place; but does this make them underachievers, or are they leaving us wanting more? With an album this layered and omnivorous, there's not much to complain about, but if they'd used all the time they've spend on writing quasi-mystical press releases on songs as sophisticated as ""Rise Rice"", they might have more bands being compared to them.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11108-kontpab/,K,2008.0,"If you're a fan of experimental rock, then you've got to check out Mahjongg's ""Kontpab"". This album is a true masterpiece of outlandish sounds and unique sonic landscapes, with a fascinating and introspective message underneath it all. From start to finish, you'll be swept up in a torrent of surprising beats, unexpected turns, and raw energy that is pure Mahjongg.

The band itself has a storied history, starting in Chicago in the early 2000s. The band members were initially inspired by post-punk and krautrock bands from the 1970s, but they quickly started to experiment with synthesizers and found sounds to create something entirely new. Their earlier albums explored everything from psychedelic rock to hip-hop, and they quickly made a name for themselves in the underground music scene. ""Kontpab"", their fifth studio album, takes things to a whole new level.

The album's creation story is a fascinating one, as the band members recorded most of it in an abandoned steel mill in Gary, Indiana. They had to pack all their equipment into a van and break into the facility, dodging security guards and other obstacles along the way. The result is an album that truly captures the raw, unadulterated energy of the band's live performances. You can hear the urgency and intensity in every track, like a thunderstorm just waiting to explode.

But what really sets ""Kontpab"" apart from other experimental rock albums is the underlying message behind the music. The album tackles themes like social isolation, technological dependency, and the struggle for personal freedom. But it does so in a way that is both thought-provoking and deeply personal, drawing the listener into the band's world and giving them a glimpse into their creative process.

Personally, I found ""Kontpab"" to be one of the most immersive and engaging albums I've listened to in a long time. From the opening track ""Whoop"", with its driving beat and infectious hook, to the closing meditative soundscape of ""Lullaby"", this album held me captive. It's an album that rewards repeated listens, as you start to pick up on all the subtleties and intricacies that make it so special.

Overall, I would highly recommend ""Kontpab"" to any fans of experimental rock, or anyone who is looking for an album that pushes the boundaries of what music can be. It's a testament to Mahjongg's creativity and passion, and easily one of the best albums of the year.  So, if you're ready to take a journey into the unknown, this is definitely the album for you.","1. Review A is longer and more verbose than Review B.

Imperial Teen,The Hair the TV the Baby & the Band,Rock,6.2,August 20 2007,Brian Howe,Contributor,"On their first LP in over five years, power-poppers Imperial Teen vie with Sonic Youth for the title of ""most ironic band name."" Barreling toward middle age, they've managed to keep the teenaged enthusiasm that defines their music intact. But it hasn't been easy for them. The Hair the TV the Baby and the Band is a meta-album that downplays the pansexual exuberance with which Imperial Teen are most closely associated. Instead, it focuses on growing old with grace, and the difficulties of continuing to rock out against the depredations of age. Despite the fact that only two of Imperial Teen's four albums came out in the 1990s-- the mid-to-late 1990s, at that-- they epitomize the sound and style of that decade's alterna-rock boom. Roddy Bottum is a 90s double-threat, having been the keyboardist for Faith No More before starting Imperial Teen. IT's hit single ""Yoo-Hoo"" was a staple on MTV's 120 Minutes, that pacesetter of all things alternative, just before the program slipped into the backwaters of MTV2 as alternative's cultural relevance waned. The indelible panting that rhythmically undergirded ""Yoo-Hoo"" is scattered about the new album, including the song ""Shim Sham"" (and wasn't ""Shim Sham"" one of the fake U.S. states that Bob Odenkirk attempted to name in seven seconds on another 90s staple, HBO's ""Mr. Show""?), which also name-checks the RockATeens. Imperial Teen have always had this bald-faced eagerness, which makes their music appealing while threatening to push it toward the silliness that occasionally plagues this comeback album. Regardless, The Hair the TV is a musical time capsule; Imperial Teen have done little to change their B-52s-redolent formula. It brims with delirious male/female harmonies, turbocharged garage-pop guitars and jangly indie-pop ones, rollicking rhythms, boisterous count-offs, bratty exclamations, and saccharine melodies. If the album's sound roots it in a bygone time, its lyrical themes date it firmly in the present. But it's a present that exists conditionally, always battling against the black hole suction of the past, as befits a fortysomething band obsessed with youth. Hair finds Imperial Teen in full-bore navel gazing mode, talking both obliquely and directly about where they are and, more importantly, how they got there. On the latter score, they seem mostly mystified, not bitter-- Imperial Teen don't go for self-pity. The album's title is a prÃ©cis of how the band members have spent the time between 2002's On and now. Roddy Bottum's been composing music for film and television; Jone Stebbins ran a hairstyling business; Lynn Truell (formerly Perko) has been popping out kids; Will Schwartz worked on his own band, Hey Willpower. The song ""Baby and the Band"" is one of the handful of unpleasantly precious tracks, but it's crucial to the album's theme. ""Wake on the shores of a distant land,"" goes a the most telling refrain, ""the hair, the TV, the baby and the band."" This land is adulthood, and Imperial Teen seem astonished to find themselves there. Such ruminations flare up throughout the album. ""Do It Better"" is a sweet indie pop swooner leavened by a crunchy rock chorus, and one of the more overtly elegiac songs on the album-- ""Got a watch that's made of gold/ But I think it's getting old""-- along with the whizzing, sultry fuzz-stomper ""Shim Sham"", a heyday revival with a distorto-oh-oh chorus: ""Now and then seems like a different scene."" And ""Room with a View"" lays it all on the line: ""We're working so hard/ And we're betting the farm/ Charge it all to the card..."" Bottum and co. are trying hard to ""pretend we'll be twenty for life,"" and this is a point where other bands might turn depressive. But Imperial Teen aren't cowed by the determinism of age: According to ""One Two"", a harmony-laden fuzz buzz that repeatedly crash lands and lifts off again, at least one band member ""hasn't finished sleeping around."" The Hair the TV the Baby and the Band sometimes steps out of this introspective mode. ""It's Now"" is a winner, bouncing back and forth between a shuffle and a crunch, with great slice-of-life lyrics in Belle and Sebastian's fey style: ""You've got mirrors on the ceiling/ You're serving Darjeeling/ And your art nouveau seems so logical to me."" Opening track ""Everything"" is less charming; its cascading guitars and hammy lyrical conceit (""Everything _____,"" from ""judicious"" to ""hypocrisy,"" over and over) make it overbearing. But maybe that's beside the point-- after all, being who you are, silly or otherwise, is the privilege of adulthood. If the album's self-indulgent moments aren't satisfying, at least they feel hard-earned.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10558-the-hair-the-tv-the-baby-the-band/,Merge,2007.0,"I recently delved into the world of Imperial Teen's ""The Hair the TV the Baby & the Band,"" and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. 

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of the album itself, let's take a quick stroll down memory lane and explore some of the band's history. Imperial Teen first burst onto the scene back in 1997 with their debut record ""Seasick"" and quickly became a staple in the indie rock scene. Their unique blend of power pop and punk rock proved to be a force to be reckoned with, and they soon became known for their catchy hooks and infectious energy. 

Fast forward to 2021, and Imperial Teen is still going strong. ""The Hair the TV the Baby & the Band"" is their seventh studio album, and it's safe to say that they've definitely not lost their touch. This album was actually recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and I think the fact that it was recorded live in the studio really adds to the overall feel of the record. 

What strikes me the most about this album is the balance between softer, more introspective moments and high-energy rockers. The opening track, ""I Think That's Everything,"" sets the stage perfectly with its dreamy, almost ethereal feel. But then, Imperial Teen really kicks things into high gear with ""We Do What We Do Best,"" a fast-paced, punk-infused romp that had me jumping out of my seat. 

Another highlight for me was ""No Matter What You Say,"" which features some pretty killer guitar riffs and some of the catchiest hooks on the album. And then there's ""How We Say Goodbye,"" which is undoubtedly one of the more melancholic tracks on the record, but it's also one of the most beautiful. 

Overall, ""The Hair the TV the Baby & the Band"" definitely won me over. It's not a perfect album, but it's definitely worth a listen if you're a fan of indie rock. I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10.","1. Review A includes more detailed information about the band's history and previous albums.

DeVotchKa,A Mad & Faithful Telling,Rock,7.7,March 19 2008,William Bowers,Contributor,"DeVotchKa's career bio is so unlikely that we pitiable reviewers usually have to indulge our inner allusion-making spazzes to give the impression that we're not just recasting the interesting facts from the band's press releases as zingers.

See, right there, you get the exoticism, the uncouthness, the kitschy passion (or earnest camp?), the hint of menace, and the nostalgia so nonspecific that it seems forward-looking.

DeVotchKa invented the Diablo Cody arc, as they've gone from accompanying burlesque/fetish shows to getting a Grammy nod, despite being unsigned at the time. Sire reportedly couldn't have them because parent company Warner thought them ""unmarketable""-- and yet they just no-thanxed an offer from McDonald's to feature their music in the ubiquitous carcass-merchant's, um, marketing. An odd byproduct of the band's matriculation to Anti- Records is realizing that one of their new labelmates already ""did"" their blend of oompah/Morricone/lounge/Latin/etc textures, though with an entirely different vocal approach: the arrangements on Tom Waits' late 1980s and early 90s Island work could be just as baroque. Nick Urata's croon, however, is, whew, like Caetano Veloso had a declamatory baby with each of the Traveling Wilburys. His intensity and, fuck it, beauty is probably what keeps the music's globe-groping cleverness from coming off as sorta quirque-du-soleil. I mean, Urata can sell impresario, lothario, and tragic romantic hero within a single track. Plus, the balanced, stately-but-dreamy production is pristine-- jams with urgent pulses á la the National/Constantines somehow feel nimble. The band adopts modes from several cultures' wedding- and-funeral traditions, yet never sounds simply ritualistic. Again, once Urata opens his trap, the proceedings immediately feel more the Cure than curated. But something mysteriously blocks this very good record from being great. I wanted it to inspire obsession, I wanted it to break my heart, I wanted its graceful fusion to borrow so freely from so many musical worlds that it achieved worldlessness. Maybe DeVotchKa's vibe is difficult to withstand for the duration of a long player. ""Head Honcho"", included here, is a revisitation of a song from the release on which they coined the term for their style: Supermelodrama. Stretching its sweetness out further than an EP can result in a new form of aesthetic torture: syrupboarding. (The two instrumentals kind of acknowledge that the listener might need a boutiquey break from how Urata's epic tremble-slur has the potential to make someone so manic that they'd practice ocular aversion to keep from believing that whoever's in their sightline is ""the one."") And the standard relationship-disillusionment lyrics are lacking. You get a (true, reckon) cliché about the winner of the rat race still being a rat, and bits such as ""You can bury it deep inside but you can never hide."" Worse, half of the songs hit such impressive peaks that the rest seem slight by comparison. But oh, those peaks-- buy this disc for ""Along the Way"", for ""Undone"", or just for the spooky dip of ""New World""'s eww/oohs. That these are the album's ballads might be testimony that what we have here is a group heartily willing to pen raucous romps for clubs and festivals while secretly wishing to go quiet.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11298-a-mad-faithful-telling/,Anti-,2008.0,"If you're looking for a unique and unforgettable listening experience, look no further than ""A Mad & Faithful Telling"" by DeVotchKa. This album, a perfect blend of rock and gypsy folk, will leave you entranced from start to finish.

DeVotchKa, formed in Denver, Colorado in 1997, has always been known for their genre-defying sound. Their music draws inspiration from various traditions and cultures, including Romani music, waltzes, and cabaret. The band's diverse musical background is evident in their instrumentation, which prominently features the accordion, violin, and sousaphone.

With ""A Mad & Faithful Telling,"" DeVotchKa continued to explore and experiment with their sound. The album was recorded in Arizona and produced by Craig Schumacher, who has worked with artists such as Neko Case and Calexico. The result is a rich and complex sonic world, filled with lush arrangements and unexpected surprises.

From the opening track, ""Basso Profundo,"" DeVotchKa's signature sound is on full display. The haunting accordion melody and frontman Nick Urata's plaintive vocals create an immediate sense of yearning and longing. The album also features some of the band's most danceable tracks, such as ""Unnecessary"" and ""Head Honcho.""

As a listener, I found myself completely entranced by the album's unique sound. The intricate arrangements and unexpected flourishes made each listen feel like a journey of discovery. There were moments when I found myself tapping my foot along with the rhythm, and moments when I simply sat back and let the music wash over me.

While ""A Mad & Faithful Telling"" is a standout in DeVotchKa's discography, it's far from their only great album. Throughout their career, the band has consistently pushed musical boundaries and created a sound that's truly their own. If you're a fan of indie rock or world music, DeVotchKa is a band you can't afford to miss.

Overall, ""A Mad & Faithful Telling"" is a masterpiece of genre-defying music. With its rich instrumentation and haunting vocals, it's an album that demands repeat listens.

The Hives,The Black and White Album,"Electronic,Rock",6.2,November 16 2007,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"Roll back to 2001-02: A swarm of vaguely retro-thinking garage bands with plural-noun names (the Hives, the Strokes, the Vines, the White Stripes) were credited with reinvigorating rock'n'roll. The press went all breathless at the sight of slightly disheveled boys in tight pants, and the Hives were promptly slapped on the cover of Spin, extensively profiled in The New Yorker, and repeatedly fawned over by the NME. Alas, the new millennium's culture-cycle is especially vicious, and by 2004, when the Hives released their fourth LP (Tyrannosaurus Hives, the follow-up to their stateside breakthrough, Veni Vidi Vicious), most folks had moved on-- which is too bad, because of all the over-hyped revivalists of the early 00s, the Hives might be the most fun. Although The Black and White Album features the same ecstatic, semi-ridiculous guitar thrashing that characterizes most of the band's previous work, it also sees the Hives expanding their sound to include more bass and songs that clock in over three minutes. This time, the band ditched its native Fagersta, Sweden to record, mostly, in Oxford, Mississippi, soliciting help from a handful of all-star producers: Pharrell Williams, Jacknife Lee, Dennis Herring (who's worked with Modest Mouse and Elvis Costello), and Thomas Oberg (beloved vocalist for a bunch of Swedish rock bands, including Bergman Rock/bob hund). With all that muscle behind the boards, it's not surprising that this is also the Hives' cleanest record to date-- the Hives were never particularly convincing as a garage band (the impeccably-tailored, color-coordinated suits didn't help), and any delusions-of-grit they may have entertained in the past are wholly eradicated here. The Black and White Album can feel, at times, thematically spastic, spinning more like a mixtape than a proper LP. Pharrell's two standout tracks-- ""Well All Right!"" and ""T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S""-- are both slinky clap-alongs that play remarkably well to the band's party-anthem tendencies: ""Well All Right!"" sees frontman Howlin' Pelle Almqvist shrieking ""People see me and they go/ Ahhhhh! Woo woo!"" over pittering drums and perfectly-orchestrated backing chants, a jubilant bit of shameless self-promotion that suits Almqvist remarkably well. Regardless of how you feel about his thick, barky pipes, Almqvist is a captivating performer-- both live and in the studio-- strutting back and forth like a cartoon Mick Jagger, lips pouted, hips popped, voice undulating, part-James Brown, part-John Fogerty. Each vocal track on The Black and White Album sounds intense and revelatory; paired with Pharrell's playful production, the Hives soar. The Hives' three self-produced cuts are just as jubilant-- with the exception of the instrumental ""A Stroll Through Hive Manor Corridors"", which is all fart-bass and creepy synthesizers. It's presumably a concept song about life-as-a-Hive, but it's also the band at their most subdued. Jacknife Lee's track (""Hey Little World"") is classic Hives, frantic and propulsive, with a few simple riffs and a broad, confrontational chorus (""Whatcha gonna do/ Any one of you?""). The bulk of the record is handled by Herring; on opener (and lead single) ""Tick Tick Boom"" a wall of guitars is balanced by a wall of vocals, with all five band members worked into a proper frenzy and howling away. At their best, the Hives are frenetic and volatile, jolting, pushing, panting-- it's punk rock at its most polished, with only the barest threat of dissolution.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10904-the-black-and-white-album/,A&M,2007.0,"The Black and White Album by The Hives is a compelling example of the dynamic fusion genre of electronic and rock music, earning a rating of 6.2 out of 10. The album pulls from their extensive experience in the industry, taking clear inspirations from the styles of both old-school rock and fresh electronic sounds.

For those unfamiliar with The Hives, they are a Swedish rock band known for their explosive live performances and punk-inspired sound. While the band initially gained popularity in the early 2000s, they have continued to evolve over the years. The Black and White Album released back in 2007, is a testament to their versatility and growth.

The creation story behind this album is an impressive one. The band moved their recording studio into a medieval French castle to write and record the tracks together, fostering an immersive creative environment. This creative decision is apparent in the songs, which feature meticulous attention to detail and a cohesive flow that ties them all together.

From the opening track, ""Tick Tick Boom,"" the album immediately grabs your attention with a bold infusion of electronic and rock sounds. The track is upbeat, with fast-paced guitars and high-energy drums. Throughout the album, the band experiments with different sounds and styles such as the psychedelic vibes of ""Return the Favour"" and the retro-rock feel of ""Hey Little World."" This variety keeps the album fresh and interesting from start to finish.

As a music lover, I can't help but appreciate the technicality and skill demonstrated in the instrumental arrangements throughout the album. The intricate production echoes their artistic commitment and stay true to their reputation. The vocal performances by frontman Pelle Almqvist are razor-sharp, powerful and complement the impressive musicianship.

While The Black and White Album is not perfect, some tracks do feel slightly uninspired and lack some of the excitement found in other parts of the album. However, it still manages to showcase the growth and versatility of The Hives, ultimately deserving of its rating of 6.2 out of 10.

Overall, The Black and White Album is a memorable experience. It serves as an excellent example of how a band can seamlessly blend electronic and rock roots with artistic skill and experimentation. The Hives showcase a welcome growth while remaining true to themselves, cementing their place as a dynamic and influential band in the music industry.","1.

Willie Nelson,Stardust: Legacy Edition,Rock,9.3,August 15 2008,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"The standards album has suffered a lot of abuse during this decade, as aging singers use it as a shorthand for artistic revitalization and as a shortcut to career revival. Nothing communicates serious intent quite as earnestly or as cheaply as recording a 75-year-old song, as Rod Stewart, George Michael, Cyndi Lauper, and others who used to be much cooler have discovered. As a result, even the word ""standards"" provokes an admittedly healthy skepticism in many listeners, but it wasn't always so. Thirty years ago, Willie Nelson took a typically left turn and followed up a string of successful albums (starting with 1975's career-making Red Headed Stranger) with a covers album of songs made famous by decidedly non-country musicians like Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Louis Armstrong. It's difficult to understand today how unusual this sort of album was, going against the grain of the contemporary country business. Label execs initially balked, but Stardust become one of the best-selling country albums of all time, spending nearly a decade on the country charts. Stranger is touted as country's first concept album and one of the foundations of outlaw country, which gives it a sheen of originality in a genre nominally interested in tradition more than innovation. But Stardust sounds like the riskier album and is by far the more rewarding collection, which is to take nothing away from Stranger. What makes the record so thrilling and very often beautiful-- and what separates him from today's ham-handed vocalists-- is Nelson's facility as an interpreter. It's not enough for him just to sing ""Georgia on My Mind"" or Kurt Weill's ""September Song"" or even to translate these songs into a country setting. With his tender, textured voice and intuitively around-the-beat phrasing, Nelson gives these songs fresh readings, with just the touch of sentimentality and nostalgia they demand. The clichÃ© ""makes them his own"" certainly applies here: He sings them as they've never been sung before or since, which is quite a feat considering their age and popularity. Hardened from endless touring into a tough, tight roadhouse revue, Nelson's band gives a surprisingly supple performance on each song, which reinforces the album's sweetly ruminative mood. Producer Booker T. Jones, of Stax fame, facilitates every aspect of the band's sound, showcasing the performers' range while ensuring the arrangements play to the lyrics and vocals without overwhelming them. The organ and restrained rhythm section hint at the soul records Jones made a decade before, while Bobbie Nelson's piano, perhaps mimicking her brother's vocal style, adds gospel and jazz flourishes to ""On the Sunny Side of the Street"" and Mickey Raphael's harmonica, one of country's most distinctive instruments, moans lonesome on ""Moonlight in Vermont"". Nelson and his band blur the distinctions between all of the stylistic elements to create a sound that is best described as simply ""American."" As such, Stardust has the force of a statement album, yet it's unlikely anyone ever intended it as such. Its casual demeanor may ultimately be the record's most winning trait. Stardust, however, was not an anomaly in Nelson's career. Previously, he had regularly tackled standards and non-country tracks, and he has continued the practice up to the present. Rather than weigh down this 2xCD Legacy Edition with lesser-quality alternate versions or sessions outtakes, compiler Gregg Geller has collected Nelson's versions of other chestnuts from previous and subsequent albums like Angel Eyes in 1984 and The Promiseland in 1986 (both of which, stunningly, are out of print). The range of material on this second disc, if not the quality or overall cohesiveness, surpasses even that of Stardust, with Nelson returning to Carmichael (""Ole Buttermilk Sky"") but also tackling the Dixieland jazz of ""Basin Street Blues"" and the smoky lounge of ""The Gypsy"". That these songs are all previously released and most of them readily available doesn't diminish their impact here. This reissue, besides being absorbing as music, almost has the feel of an essay on Nelson's interpretive abilities. It's not being billed as such, but this Legacy Edition marks the album's 30th anniversary. While country music has changed dramatically since then, Nelson continues to tour like crazy, record nearly constantly, and generally follow his own muse wherever it takes him. In the past few years he has collaborated with artists as diverse as Ryan Adams and Kenny Chesney (surely Timbaland is in line). He rarely writes new material anymore, but continues to reinterpret his own and others' past hits. Generally the songs he chooses are so durable and his style so personal that they allow and even reward countless variations. As such, even more than the sustained narrative of The Red Headed Stranger, Stardust set both the template for Nelson's career and the standard. Few artists have treat the American Songbook so affectionately and so cavalierly.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12091-stardust-legacy-edition/,"Columbia,Columbia",1978.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up and get ready for a divine experience. We're about to talk about Willie Nelson's absolutely stellar album, the ""Stardust: Legacy Edition"". This classic rock album is without a doubt, one of the best I've listened to in a long time, and I don't say that lightly. With a rating of 9.3 out of 10, you already know it's going to be an exceptional piece of art.

To appreciate the album's impact more, let's delve into the history behind the making of this masterpiece. To start off, Willie Nelson, a country music icon and legend, made a risky move by stepping out of his comfort zone and diving into the realm of rock, but boy, does it pay off. ""Stardust: Legacy Edition"" is a reissue of his 1978 album ""Stardust"", known for its arrangement of jazz standards. However, the Legacy Edition brings new life to these gems, showcasing a well-polished, refined sound with the help of some of the best rock musicians of the time, making it a perfect collision of country and rock.

As for the songs themselves, every single one is an absolute treat to listen to. From the classic track ""Georgia On My Mind"" to ""Blue Skies"", each song is carefully selected and curated, displaying Willie's extraordinary talent for storytelling and songwriting. One of the highest points of this album is Willie's vocals, which sound incredible, and are full of emotion and depth. The use of instruments such as the harmonica, electric guitar, and violin adds layers of dimension to each song, making it even more dynamic and enjoyable.

Personally, I believe the album's standout tracks ""Don't Get Around Much Anymore"" and ""Moonlight In Vermont"" steal the show, giving a glimpse of Willie's expertise and the impact he has had on rock music. The music's strength rests not only in the quality of the production but in the way it is arranged, crafted, and performed. 

In conclusion, ""Stardust: Legacy Edition"" is a masterpiece that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. Willie Nelson and his team have done an outstanding job in bringing us this rock album, full of jazz standards, creating a masterpiece that transcends genres. It's an album that should have a place in every Rock lover's collection. It would be a disservice to yourself not to cherish this gem. I highly recommend it.","1.

Rogue Wave,Descended Like Vultures,"Experimental,Rock",7.8,October 25 2005,Brian Howe,Contributor,"As a member of the Desoto Reds, Zach Rogue was working a crushing 70 hours/week at a web development company, frustrated, and desperate for change. Then a round of layoffs saved Rogue like a last-minute call from the governor and he beat a retreat to New York to see what he could accomplish on his own. Clutching a sheaf of the delicately odd pop songs he'd written but had no outlet for in Desoto Reds, he holed up in the studio with his friend Bill Racine and together the two began spontaneously cranking out the tracks that would become Out of the Shadow, an album that would earn Rogue Wave a Sub Pop deal-- and an endless parade of Shins comparisons. The spirit of adventure and freedom that accompanied Rogue's life-change was apparent in the record, which featured wispy, spectral tunes, somewhere between Simon & Garfunkel and Yo La Tengo, embroidered with intricate details. Rogue assembled a band to take the songs on the road, and this quartet-- which includes Gram LeBron, Pat Spurgeon, and Evan Farrell-- is collectively responsible for Rogue Wave's sophomore outing, Descended Like Vultures. As such, it's reasonable to expect a record very different from the debut, which was penned entirely by Rogue. The first single from the new album, ""10:1"", confirms a sea change: Where the atmospheric debut laced cloudy melodies with quiet traces of heat lightning, ""10:1"" is a crashing thunderbolt. The thin, melodic contour lines that primarily structured Out of the Shadow become barely discernible underpinnings on this track, subsumed in raucously cartwheeling synths and returning producer Bill Racine's bracing guitar manipulation. The only vestige of the old Rogue Wave is Rogue's voice. Has the band that relied on off-kilter charm forsaken their chilly moderation for heat-seeking rock? You know, sort-of-ish: ""10:1"" is a bit of a red herring. The main difference between the two albums has more to do with volume than style. The production now has more depth, and you're more likely to hear subtle (or not-so-subtle, in the case of ""10:1"") filters on the vocals. Out of the Shadow seemed to emanate from very far away, but Descended Like Vultures is more visceral and immediate, although the loud tracks are largely tempered and controlled. Once the disappointment that it's not a Leonard Cohen cover fades, the album's opening track, ""Bird on a Wire"", is a charming introduction to the louder side of Rogue Wave: Crisp drum rolls and strident bleats buffet the melody toward an outsized, lighter-waving chorus. The driving mid-tempo guitars that open ""Publish My Love"" are contrasted with an acoustic arpeggio that would've been the song's stopping point on the first album. The excellent ""Love's Lost Guarantee"" profits from the same contrast, revealing a surprising but totally sensible Death Cab for Cutie affinity as it alternates darkly twinkling passages with romantically crashing choruses. Other tracks expand upon the gauzy, pensive aura of Out of the Shadow instead of revising it. A lively yet gentle strum and Rogue's weightless vocal melody comprise ""California""; a low wash of strings colors the back end, and in its simple transparency it's one of the album's most memorable songs. ""Temporary"" should come included with stool and capo, with its murky chord progression and mumbled, depressive vocals. In the end, it's hard to decide if Descended Like Vultures is better or worse than Rogue Wave's debut. Differences that seem major turn out, upon close inspection, to be cosmetic, and if the extra padding relieves the songs of some of their signature inertia, the parts that stick in your head-- Rogue's lilting, saccharine melodies-- remain unchanged. Rather than evolving linearly, Rogue Wave are building upwards, piling masonry onto a foundation of solid songwriting that, with any luck, will remain as perceptible and essential on Rogue Wave's 10th album as it is on their second.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6920-descended-like-vultures/,Sub Pop,2005.0,"If you're craving a taste of something unique, experimental, and yet familiar, then you should definitely get your hands on the album Descended Like Vultures by Rogue Wave. It's an experimental rock masterpiece that pushes the genre to new heights while maintaining the band's signature sound. With a rating of 7.8 out of 10, this album delivers one of the most refreshing musical experiences of the year.

To truly appreciate Descended Like Vultures, let's take a step back in time and delve into Rogue Wave's history. The band was formed in 2002 in Oakland, California, by Zach Schwartz. The initial trio expanded to a quartet with the addition of Pat Spurgeon, Gram LeBron, and Evan Farrell. Although they faced the disheartening loss of their bassist Evan Farrell in 2007, the band continued to push forward and create remarkable music. They have since released six studio albums, with Descended Like Vultures being their second.

The album was recorded in two studios located in San Francisco and Oakland, California. The band's approach towards the creation of this album was unconventional, with them focusing on capturing the process of producing the album, rather than aiming for perfection. This allowed for more exploration and experimentation, resulting in songs that are unpredictable, stunningly beautiful, and emotionally potent.

The album is expertly crafted, with the use of diverse instruments and meticulous attention to detail. The opening song, ""Bird on a Wire,"" sets the tone with its acoustic guitar riffs and melodic harmonies. It's succeeded by the ethereal ""Publish My Love,"" which features an intricate blend of guitar, drum, and keyboard. The songs on this album range from nostalgic and calming to upbeat and high-energy, and the dynamics of the album will leave you feeling like you've been on a journey.

As someone who loves experimental music, Descended Like Vultures is a breath of fresh air to my ears. This album is so diverse that it accommodates the preferences of a variety of music lovers, with its bold experimentation that never feels forced or excessive. The band's use of unique instruments like the mandolin and lap steel invoke a sense of folk and country, while the rock elements maintain a certain grit and intensity. To say the least, the album is an entirely unique experience.

In conclusion, Descended Like Vultures is an excellent album that showcases Rogue Wave's exceptional musical abilities. The band's approach of embracing imperfection has ultimately delivered a polished and ambitious album that stands out in the crowded experimental rock genre. If you're looking for an album that goes beyond the boundaries of what you usually listen to, Descended Like Vultures is definitely worth your time.","1.

Various Artists,Pure Tone Audiometry,,7.4,April 8 2003,Eric Carr,Contributor,"Can there be any purpose behind a master's degree in the psychology of music other than inevitably attempting to rule the minds of men through the manipulative powers of sound? I submit that there can not; the job prospects from a degree like that are, like, what? Music therapist? I don't think so. The only career I can imagine it successfully leading to is Supervillian. It doesn't take a superhuman intellect to see through the aims of Jon DeRosa's education-- he's the arch-mastermind behind the warm, homey folk of Pale Horse and Rider, and has guested on several other records, including Debridement, a recent Chairkickers release by Rivulets. But none of his various projects are more dangerous, more insidious, than the icy calm of Aarktica's dreamy ambiance. In fact, his nefarious desire to lull listeners into a pliant, peaceful daydream (and then rob them, no doubt-- or worse!) could easily have succeeded with last year's Or You Could Just Go Through Your Whole Life and Be Happy Anyway if it weren't for the heroic actions of Pitchfo... hey, wait. That got a really positive review... uuuhhhh.... now... that... I think about it, Pure Tone Audiometry is really... pretty... oh, god, no... if I don't come back, tell Kathleen Hanna... I... love... her... Wow... where was I? I always get distracted by the lush, diffuse tones at the conclusion of ""Out to Sea"". The track opens Pure Tone Audiometry with a delicate, Magnetic Fields-ish male/female vocal dynamic between DeRosa and Lorraine Lelis, as they sweetly harmonize over the romantic notions of being lost at sea and never again seeing home. Before long, the voices become lost in the hazy ambiance completely, and the experimental pop is vaporized; only Lelis' seraphic call remains to try and navigate the listener through the droning fog. Eventually, even the music itself vanishes. DeRosa's arrangements are intensely careful and subdued, and never once does he allow his deliberately constructed tranquility to be disturbed. The few real swells of emotion are thrilling, but momentary; such an austere, clinical tone is produced that it sometimes becomes stultifying, although I'm not sure emotive response is the aim here. Aarktica is cold, pure, and almost inescapably tranquil. ""Snowstorm Ruins Birthday"" revisits the vapor that lingers from ""Out to Sea"". There was music here, but now only traces remain, surrounding the listener in a wintry mist of component sounds, atomic gray noise, a touching (but still distant) pop melody dissolved into its basic elements. Slowly, song structures reform; DeRosa's wispy vocals return alongside Lelis' stunning accompaniment, triumphantly welling up from miles beneath the faintly reverberating electric and simple acoustic plucking in ""Ocean""'s beautiful climax. ""Big Year"" explores the darker regions of Aarktica's ethereal shoegazing like a slightly cheerier version of Projekt-based ambient artists Lycia; the listener is inexorably pulled deeper into the track's echoing maze of acoustics, subtly ominous drones, and trembling strings. Until... total silence? No, wait. Not total. DeRosa slipped up; ""Water Wakes Dead Cells"" is a five-minute foray into ultra-minimalist drone, just a rhythmic pulse wrapped in a barely audible hum, before eventually bowing out completely. The sheer vacancy of what amounts to little more than empty space is pretty unnecessary, and though it's anything but jarring, it still stands out as a glaring hole in an otherwise pristine calm. As a breather before ""Williamsburg Counterpoint"", Pure Tone Audiometry's twelve-minute centerpiece, ""Water Wakes Dead Cells"" is briefly very effective. By the halfway point, though, the album's hypnotic spell has been broken-- it served as an anticlimactic pause, but after a few minutes, it just seems like a good time to get a drink, to make my escape. Ah, who am I kidding? Aarktica's attempt to pacify and control his audience into a narcotized lull is good but not perfect. Of course, it's too late for me, but at least you've been warned. Jon DeRosa is a madman! He wants to control the world with his beautiful, antiseptic melodies! He's nearly succeeded yet again! Tell the world before it's too late!",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6-pure-tone-audiometry/,Silber,2003.0,"If you're looking for a unique sound that cannot be defined by any particular genre, 'Pure Tone Audiometry' by Various Artists is an album that should definitely make it onto your playlist.

The album features an array of artists, each bringing their own style and flavor to the mix. Tunes like ""Echoes in Infinity"" and ""Breaths In Waves"" have a distinctive sound that blends seamlessly with the other tracks.

One thing worth noting is that with such a unique sound and genre label, not everyone may enjoy this album. It's not your typical pop or rock album, but that's also what makes it special. It breaks away from the typical conventions and explores new sounds, which is always refreshing to hear.

Overall, I would give 'Pure Tone Audiometry' a 7.4 out of 10. It's an album that takes some time to appreciate, but once you do, it's undeniable that the music is something special. It's an album that I would recommend to those who are looking for something different, and a soundtrack to accompany them while exploring new horizons.","Step 1: Review A has a conversational tone and informal language, such as ""like, what?"" and ""I submit that there can not."" Review B, on the other hand, has a more polished and professional tone, with proper grammar and language.

Step 2: Review A has a clear opinion about the album being reviewed, with strong statements such as ""Jon DeRosa is a madman! He wants to control the world with his beautiful, antiseptic melodies!"" Review B focuses more on describing the music and its unique qualities, with less emphasis on personal opinion.

Step 4: Review A often veers off-topic and has a somewhat rambling structure, while Review B follows a more linear, logical organization.

Conclusion: Review B is the human written review, due to its polished tone, focus on description rather than personal opinion, and logical structure. Review A, with its informal language, strong opinions, and rambling structure, is likely the generated model review.",0.8502179875142536,Review B
The Builders and the Butchers,Dead Reckoning,Rock,6.5,March 14 2011,Paul Thompson,Contributor,"Babies burn, oceans overflow, family trees don't fork; Dead Reckoning, the third LP from Portland's the Builders and the Butchers, plays out a little like Cormac McCarthy Unplugged, a ramshackle 19th century end-times sermon gone folk-rock. ""The whole world's rotten to the core,"" singer Ryan Sollee reminds us with a howl on the album's most cathartic chorus. We may already be this screwed, the Builders and the Butchers seem to be suggesting throughout Dead Reckoning. High time we started shouting about it. The rivers and trains and once-fashionable women's names peppering their lyrics and the old-timey garb they don for press photos further lend the Builders' doomsaying an out-of-time quality. Often, their blood-spattered, Revelations feel-- matched with Sollee's nasal voice and all the rollicking arrangements-- bears an uncanny resemblance of their fellow Portlandic histrionical society, the Decemberists. Like The King Is Dead and R.E.M., it's a comparison the Butchers surely could've predicted; hell, the Decemberists' Chris Funk sat behind the boards on their last album. Sollee's voice is a close cousin to Meloy's, less nuanced perhaps but wilder in the big moments. And the band's half-delicate, half-driving acoustic pileup's got plenty in common with their citymates' earlier, less fussy records. It'd be awfully easy to dismiss the Butchers as mere Decemberist-a-likes, but there's a jittery, paranoiac quality to their music-- and Sollee's shouts in particular-- that lends it a very different intensity than even those earlier, more murderous Decemberists LPs. It's almost as though, while Colin Meloy was down in Missoula studying literature, Sollee and company were somewhere deep in the woods, working out the bylaws of their own sovereign nation. All that might sound a bit bleak, but it's actually fairly raucous, helped along by the Butchers' fondness for big shoutalong choruses and the sweaty live-in-a-room feel of their arrangements. Using two drummers to play a single kit, there's a wild clatter in the uptempo numbers well suited to Sollee's breathless proselytizing. ""We All Know the Way"" imagines devotion-as-lockstep; an ironic place for a singalong, yet there it is. There's plenty of unusually rollicking moments like that all over Dead Reckoning, plenty of morbid lines that feel almost celebratory in their hands. Recorded quickly, with minimal overdubs, Dead Reckoning has an urgency and a sense of from-the-ether evil even in its slower moments; stark, swirling highlight ""Out of the Mountain"" finds Sollee moaning quite matter-of-factly about setting fire to the earth and ""keeping the rain""; this isn't just any old pyro talking, and Sollee's grim lyrical visions are left to linger in this sparse setting. Sometimes the fervor gets to be too much for them: the grating but mercifully brief ""Blood for You"" is little more than the junkyard clang of the rhythm section and Sollee's stuck-pig shout, and the verses ""Cradle on Fire"" seem to get away from Sollee, who loses the melody somewhere in the back of his throat. But there's few moments when they don't seem to be throwing everything they've got into these performances, and that furious intensity drives them past both rough patches and easy comparisons. A couple of these melodies seem to run together after a couple listens, and at times the music could stand to be a bit more gnarled to match some of Sollee's more sinister sentiments. But even as they scream down the sky, the Builders and the Butchers seem to be having a blast, and it's catching. Should the end of days finds you with a bottle of whiskey and Dead Reckoning, pray you've got a way to play the thing.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15194-dead-reckoning/,Badman,2011.0,"If you're a fan of indie rock, chances are you've heard of The Builders and the Butchers. This Portland-based band has been around since the early 2000s, and their latest release, ""Dead Reckoning,"" is sure to please longtime fans while also drawing in newcomers to their unique sound.

""Dead Reckoning"" feels like a journey through the dark and twisted corners of rock and roll, with haunting vocals and a driving beat that takes you on a wild ride from start to finish. The Builders and the Butchers manage to blend a lot of different elements into their music, whether it's folk-tinged acoustic numbers like ""Casket Lands"" or more straightforward rock tracks like ""Never Tell."" It's hard to pin down exactly what this band is all about, but that's part of their appeal.

One thing that's immediately apparent when listening to ""Dead Reckoning"" is just how polished the production is. The album was recorded at Type Foundry Studio in Portland, with Ryan Hadlock (who has worked with the likes of The Lumineers and Brandi Carlile) handling the mixing duties. This attention to detail really pays off - everything here sounds crisp and clear, without losing any of the raw energy that makes The Builders and the Butchers such a compelling live act.

But it's not just the production that makes ""Dead Reckoning"" such a strong album. The songs themselves are well-crafted and full of interesting twists and turns. Opener ""All Turn to Fire, Pt. 1"" sets the tone early on, with frontman Ryan Sollee's raspy vocals leading the charge over a driving beat and a wall of distorted guitars. From there, the album fluctuates between quieter moments and more bombastic ones, with highlights including the haunting ""Zombie"" and the rollicking ""Casket Lands.""

While ""Dead Reckoning"" may not reinvent the wheel when it comes to rock music, it's an album that still feels fresh and vital. The Builders and the Butchers have a knack for taking familiar sounds and twisting them in just the right way, resulting in an album that's both approachable and full of surprises. While it may not be a perfect album - a few of the tracks feel like they could use a bit more breathing room - it's a strong addition to the band's already impressive discography.

Overall, ""Dead Reckoning"" is an album that feels like it's been a long time coming - and it's definitely worth the wait. Whether you're already a fan or you're just discovering The Builders and the Butchers for the first time, this is an album that's sure to leave you wanting more. It's not perfect, but it's damn good - and in the end, isn't that all that really matters?","Step 1: Review A has a more descriptive and poetic language, referring to the music as a ""ramshackle 19th century end-times sermon gone folk-rock"" and a ""blood-spattered, Revelations feel.""

Jamie Woon,Mirrorwriting,Pop/R&B,8.0,April 14 2011,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"Is 2011 turning out to be the year UK bass music goes semi-mainstream? Well, kinda. Sorta. Not exactly. For one thing, genres like dubstep and funky have been moving away from the club fringe and toward the center of the pop conversation for a while now. (In the UK itself, they've been at the center for some time already.) Dubstep sonics, however toned-down or disguised, can be heard in all sorts of chart music these days. And now we have a full slate of singers with (sometimes very loose) connections to bass culture, several of whom have released albums in 2011 aimed as much as folks who need songs as folks who obsessively collect dubplates. Thing is, and not a little ironically, the singer whose songs have the strongest sonic connection to UK bass is also the most pop, Katy B, where the hard-hitting drums and wobbler bass effects are sweetened by her I-wanna-be-a-star delivery. Meanwhile, dubstep fans, juiced on the weird rhythmic experiments of his early singles, have been scratching their heads trying to figure out why James Blake's album so firmly lashed itself to the mast of indie-crooner culture. And in the middle, we have Jamie Woon. Almost the exact middle, actually. Young and school-trained London singer Woon's debut album, Mirrorwriting, sits between Katy B and James B, pop theatricality and singer-songwriter calm, club culture and bedroom indie, old-school soul and modern electronic R&B, extroverted and introverted. And tying it all together is the language of UK bass. His first major single, 2010's justly lauded ""Night Air"", announced him as one of a number of young English artists for whom garage, and everything that came after, was just another bit of pop language to use. And from the slow-motion jungle syncopations and muted bass blare of ""Street"" to the stuttering retro-rave breakbeats that drive ""Spirits"", the computer-assisted Woon makes sorta-pop from the last 20 years of UK dance the way current U.S. guitar kids draw from surf-rock and girl-groups. But if that's all Woon was doing, he'd be just another indie one-man-band with a full software suite, making specialist music with materials from stuff with more pop-appeal. A couple things about Mirrorwriting make you wonder though if Woon really is destined for crossover success. One is his voice, which is the instrument that turns many of these songs from sorta-pop to real-deal pop. Much has been made that Woon went to the same school that gave us Amy Winehouse. His delivery is low-key for most of Mirrorwriting, far from her roadhouse belting, but the guy's clearly got chops, and an elastic way with a number of styles. And unlike a lot of guys making a murky late-night brand of indie-soul right now, Woon's pleasingly warm and smooth tone, mixed mostly up-front with little obscuring reverb or distortion, gives you the feeling that he could have a straight R&B career if he wanted. His restraint and lack of melisma trickery seems more like a choice to fit the slow drift of the music, not a limitation, and his use of HTDW/Blake style heavily processed vocals is careful, like Burial samples deployed as background harmonies. Woon wants these songs to appeal to folks for whom digitally tweaked singing is an occasional fun special effect, rather than the whole draw. And while the album's mostly full of left-field R&B, there are also hints of Hall and Oates, 80s Brit synth-pop, house, and more. There's also an occasional and unfortunate tendency toward limp VH1-ready MOR ballads, which it must be said comprises the album's weakest stuff, though thankfully Woon doesn't indulge this side as much as a truly crossover-minded hack might. Woon's attempted to bridge so many opposed vibes here that you'd want to praise his ambition, even if he couldn't pull it off. The fact that Mirrorwriting really does manage to blur so many different musical worlds into something so smoothly unified is Woon's real achievement. But because of that very in-betweenness, Mirrorwriting is still likely to rankle genre partisans of all stripes. Too slick and synth-heavy and modern for fans of Winehouse-style retro-soul. Too subtle for true dubstep fans wanting more club thunder. Not subtle enough for those heart-on-sleeve beat weirdos who've made James Blake a cause celeb. So it'll be interesting to see if it really is the wide mass of pop and indie listeners that winds up embracing Woon's everything-at-once approach. Whoever his audience turns out to be, Woon's managed one assured and beguiling hybrid of UK bass pressure and slick blue-eyed soul.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15309-mirrorwriting/,"Polydor,Candent Songs",2011.0,"When Jamie Woon released ""Mirrorwriting"" in 2011, it was clear that he had crafted something special. As a pop/R&B album, it came as a refreshing change of pace for an industry that was beginning to sound stale. Woon's vocal range and creative flair shone through on every track, cementing his place among the most talented musicians in the genre.

Woon had been immersed in music from a young age. His mother was a classical violinist, and his father was a musician and teacher. Growing up in East London, he was exposed to a range of different musical styles and cultures, which eventually led him to study at the BRIT School for Performing Arts in Croydon.

After he graduated, Woon honed his skills as a musician and DJ. He began experimenting with different sounds and collaborating with other artists, ultimately leading to the development of his signature style. It was a long and winding road, but it all paid off with the release of ""Mirrorwriting"".

The album is a testament to Woon's talent and creativity as a songwriter. Each track is carefully crafted and thoughtfully arranged, blending pop and R&B influences with his own unique style. Highlights include ""Lady Luck"", which showcases his impressive vocal range, and ""Street"", which features a mesmerizing beat and haunting lyrics.

What really sets ""Mirrorwriting"" apart, however, is the level of emotion that Woon infuses into each song. From the raw vulnerability of ""Shoulda"" to the upbeat energy of ""Middle"", the album runs the gamut of emotions. It's clear that Woon poured his heart and soul into this work, and the end result is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time.

Personally, I was blown away by the sheer talent on display in this album. The production value is top-notch, and the songs are diverse enough to keep me listening from start to finish. Woon's voice is truly something special, and he's able to convey emotion with just a few notes. Overall, ""Mirrorwriting"" is an excellent album that is well worth a listen for anyone who loves pop or R&B music. I give it an 8.0 out of 10.","1.

Collections of Colonies of Bees,GIVING,Rock,6.8,August 11 2011,Brian Howe,Contributor,"Milwaukee's Collections of Colonies of Bees has been called a side project to Pele, the post-rock band that guitarist Chris Rosenau and drummer Jon Mueller founded in 1997. But those roles look pretty shaky now that Pele is defunct and CCB is still going strong. Founded almost concurrently with Pele, the project began as an outlet to explore folk and bluegrass in a post-rock context, and while its purview quickly expanded, those origins are still vestigial in new album GIVING. They're tangible in the bright banjo plinking behind the guitar cascades of ""Lawns"", and they spiritually inform the conversational disposition of the instruments. Though the songs are as sprawling and segmented as the band's name, CCB brings a touch of relaxed humanity to a style of music that can be unduly grave. While peers such as Explosions in the Sky worship sheer trajectory, CCB seem more interested in the vistas that open up along the way. Downtown minimalism and ambient electronics have become pervasive influences, and during tiered ascents that take in the molten guitar waves of Rhys Chatham (with whom Mueller has worked) and the spectral patterns of Steve Reich, the band often wanders off-course to linger in Eno-inspired electronic wildernesses. Their adventurousness earned them a devoted fanbase, and their stock really took off in 2009, when they hooked up with Justin Vernon to create the widely admired Unmap as Volcano Choir. The four-song, half-hour GIVING is their first new record since then, and finds them saying hello to new fans while bidding goodbye to two outgoing members, Mueller and pianist Thomas Wincek. It feels both triumphal and valedictory, bypassing spacey tangents in favor of CCB's hard-charging live sound. Though GIVING may be an unusually eyes-on-the-prize record for CCB, they still have more in common with questing, omnivorous post-rock bands like Jaga Jazzist than with the single-minded crescendo hunters of the world. Variations of force and expression derive less from rhythmic and harmonic changes than from the accumulation and development of soulful ostinati, woven in and out of freer, more ""rock"" chord progressions. Though a guitar may occasionally break off for an expressive flight of fancy, there's seldom a single musician carrying the moment-- instead, they each lean into repetitive fragments that gradually coalesce into organic, blossoming wholes. At the deepest level, a collectivist honeycomb pattern prevails, and the one-note lead seared across alternating bars of the crunchy climax of ""Vorm"" is the closest thing you'll hear to a killer solo. This is rock music that has come almost completely unstuck from the blues, with a sleek, relentless drive subbing in for swing. Mueller's almost motorik-style percussion sows accents in the intricate layers of pattern, so that similar instrumental passages take on different feelings of loping, staggering, or soaring. Still, it doesn't quite save the album from a somewhat monolithic quality, which is clearly intentional but can be a trifle wearisome. ""Lawn"" is the obvious anthem; ""Vorm"" is bucolic and churning; ""Lawns"" is moodier; and ""Vorms"" is the rangy epic. These cosmetic adjustments to one hypnotically bruising ideal only go so far, and if you're not in the mood to hear dudes being really stoked about their guitar playing, it can make for a long half-hour. But all in all, it's an exciting victory lap for a band whose confidence is highly palpable in this hard-earned moment of high visibility.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15718-giving/,Hometapes,2011.0,"If you're looking for a rock album that's a little off the beaten path, you might want to check out Collections of Colonies of Bees' latest release, 'GIVING'. The band, which hails from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has been active since the early 2000s, and has gained a following thanks to their unique blend of math rock and post-rock, alongside their collaboration with fellow Wisconsin act Bon Iver. 

On 'GIVING', the six-piece band aims to create textures and moods through their instrumental work, offering a listening experience that is both meditative and invigorating. The album was recorded in their home studio, which provided the band with the flexibility they needed to experiment with different sounds and arrangements. 

The band's technical prowess and their willingness to push boundaries are evident from the opening track, ""Ruins"". A muted guitar pattern sets up the song's hypnotic groove, as the other instruments layer on top of each other to create a lush atmosphere. ""Harvest"" is another standout track because of its interplay between guitar and drums, which creates a dynamic tension. 

Of course, this album is not without its flaws. At times, the lack of vocals may make it difficult for listeners to connect with the music on an emotional level. Additionally, some of the tracks can ramble on a bit too long, without fully developing any themes. Nonetheless, 'GIVING' offers an ambitious, creative take on the rock genre that is worth a listen.

Personally, I appreciated the album's experimental approach and willingness to take risks. As someone who has seen the band perform live a few times, I can attest to their ability to create a powerful atmosphere, even without the presence of a vocalist. That being said, I do understand that some music fans may find 'GIVING' a bit too cerebral or intimidating. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a rock album that challenges your expectations, you should give Collections of Colonies of Bees' 'GIVING' the chance it deserves. 

Overall, 'GIVING' is an intriguing and bold album, showcasing the band's technical abilities and their commitment to exploring new sounds within the rock genre.

Looper,Up a Tree,Electronic,8.1,March 9 1999,Chip Chanko,,"I'm a Looper,
He's a Looper,
She's a Looper,
We're a Looper,
Wouldn't you like to be a Looper, too? Stuart David of Belle and Sebastian has handed a DIY book on home sampling out to any and all kids with a Casio keyboard and a tape recorder. He wants them to turn everyday life into a story set to music. And to quote something I read somewhere more than twice, ""lovely music it is."" David makes me happy because he writes happy songs. Hmm... I guess I should have more to say on the subject. Well, let's put it like this: David notices things and takes pleasure in them. He's someone who could sit on the front porch with a ray of sunlight touching his toes and realize that it was good. The songs on Up a Tree don't wander far from the backyard. Actually, three of them don't even leave the treehouse. There's one that tells the story of him and his wife Karn (who performs the visual half of Looper... adding slides and movies to their shows) and the letter- writing that led to their here and now. None of these are actually the best songs ever written, but they're fun. And the honesty with which David presents his stories along with the stripped down and earnest 'electronica' backing them is far fresher than pretty much anything you can hear on the radio today. I'd like to go to a club (I guess that means I have to go to a club) and shake my all to any of them, but I'd rather just sit in the grass and listen. ""The Ballad of Ray Suzuki"" professes David' belief that we all can be Loopers. Most people probably won't follow his lead, although I could envision some sort of folk-hop movement starting up on the college campuses. Drum machine, anyone? Care for a tape loop, madame? Sample yourself. Sample your friends. Just don't sample the Police or Led Zeppelin and perform rap Karaoke over them. No one would ever buy that.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4850-up-a-tree/,Sub Pop,1999.0,"Loops, beats and grooves- Looper's latest album Up a Tree, is an electronic masterpiece. If you're into open acoustic soundscapes, trippy beats and off-kilter rhythms, this record is the perfect antidote. With a rating of 8.1, it's mesmerizing and captivating, with layer upon layer of electronic effects that delivers a complex sound journey.

Looper is a Scottish indie/electronic band, formed in 1998 by Stuart David, creator of Belle and Sebastian. Up a Tree is their sixth album, released after 4 years of silence since their previous, and quite underrated album Offgrid:Offline. The band has been known for its innovative approach to digital techniques since its inception, blending lo-fi electronica with elements of pop, indie rock, and ambient music. They incorporate field recordings, plenty of instrumentals and crisp, clean textures in a style that is both experimental and highly melodic. 

Up a Tree, according to Stuart David, is a reflection of his transition from being a full-time musician to becoming a writer - the album is filled with inspirations from his writing experiences. Conceptually, it emphasizes ideas of observation and trees, with the concept of being up a tree - observing things from a higher vantage point - as the concept to build on. Listening to it, you can feel a sense of freedom and an urge to escape into the great outdoors.

The opening track 'Farfisa Song' is a perfect introduction to the album. It starts quietly, with an almost nostalgic melody that gradually turns into a deep electronic sound, with a glitchy bass drum that makes you want to move your body. The guitar melody in 'Castlecombe' is a standout feature, evoking nature and a sense of freedom. It's a track that would be perfect to listen to on a long drive through the country, with the windows down and a clear open road ahead of you.

'Pining Pt. 1' is the perfect example of how Looper merges experimental techniques with a pop sensibility. Becky Simpson's ethereal vocals blend seamlessly with the soundscape, while the lyrics talk about being in love with a tree - an idea that could sound ridiculous in anyone else's hands. The instrumentals in 'Bug Rain' and 'Pining Pt.2' have an outlandish, dreamy quality that speaks to you on so many levels. 

Although the album seems to be a little bit on the shorter side, with only 9 tracks, the blend of sounds is so hypnotic that as the record spins to a close, you'll feel the need to start it all over again. Speaking from personal experience, Up a Tree is the perfect album to listen to on a lonely night, or to escape into your own world of electronic bliss. 

In conclusion, Looper's Up a Tree is a stunning album- one that both experimental electronic music fans and pop enthusiasts should not miss. Uniquely accomplished and well crafted, it's a great reflection of the band's experimental nature, and will undoubtedly be considered a classic for years to come.","1.

Wizardzz,Hidden City of Taurmond,,6.9,June 13 2006,Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,"Man, the Lightning Bolt guys are everywhere. Beyond participating in real-deal art exhibitions (we're talking Artforum reviews) and publishing day-glo comics, the two Brians are showcasing their musical skills in various extracurricular projects. Along with rocking it in Mindflayer, Brian Chippendale also maintains his one-man band, Black Pus, releasing hand-screened CD-R's on his diarreahRama label. His bass-toting partner, Brian Gibson, is equally restless. Load recently put out his Sponge Bob-cum-Harry Pussy cartoon bonanza, Barkley's Barnyard Critters: A Mystery Tail DVD, which Gibson soundtracked with his two-man side-project, Wizardzz, who have concurrently dropped their debut full-length, Hidden City of Taurmond. In Wizardzz, Gibson forgoes his bass duties and gives drums a go-- not surprisingly, this jack of every trade has skills. His break-beats, open-ended jazzercise inflections, and fucked-up disco hits combine with Bug Sized Mind's Rich Porter, whose crystal-cave synth lines flesh out the band's sound. Despite the heavy pounding, this is not a noise record. Wizardzz's fairy-tale waltzes and fun-house soundtracks are genuinely poppy, and even when things implode, the dust is often glittery. There's a sci-fi feel Ã¡ la Dr. Who; occasionally, I hear a bit of, well, the Who. Or at least Pete Townshend's synthesizer. Trust me: One of the trills on ""Diamond Mirror"" pays homage to ""Baba O'Riley"". Maybe ""Wizardzz"" is a riff on the Pinball Wizard-- why not? It makes sense, considering the arcade-game sounds this Providence duo create. Then comes the progressive rock. ""Sailship"" could be re-titled ""Starship""-- it sounds like some old dude on the organ at your local church playing ELO. ""Chasing Our Shadow"" gets crunkier in the drum department; the keys, though, are a Tangerine Dream of a guy riffing Steve Vai. ""Do Come in (Tea And Chulliwigs)"" could be a prog'n'Bach-lovin' dandy set loose during the seventh-inning stretch at Shea. The album has a number of sugary/catchy up-tempo pieces-- some start to wear thin in their fucking cheeriness. Hidden City of Taurmond 's most enjoyable moments occur when things freak out-- the circus drops back and the palette get overloaded, cracking into Art Blakey spasmodic: the clattering, sweaty ""Sea Battle At Orkusk"" or the synthy, post-jazz apocalypse of ""Ambushed By Time Quagga"". ""Lady Dragons"" is a few minutes of radio static and tiny rock swirls before it blows up into a skin-rattling workout. When Gibson gets entropic, his swampy drum loops are undeniable. There aren't enough of these, though, and at 44 minutes Hidden City of Taurmond is too long. Eventually, what started out as frenetic feels listless. That said, pay attention to closer ""Mimi Vivian Sunrise (Live)"". In a club or practice space setting, the mix is stunning, focusing on all of Wizardzz's best elements: the vibe becomes acid-house/psychedelic/shoegaze fuzz, the synths approximate distorted guitars, the drums overwhelm, and the sugary sunbursts are toppled with grime. You can see masked Gibson and Porter play somewhere on the Barkley DVD. In that footage, a dude with stylish hair attempts to bite one of the cymbals, as if it's candy, or better yet, some drug that'll take him straight to Taurmond. So while these 14 tracks offer a few stunners, Wizardzz seem to be an especially ecstatic live band. Wonder if they can fit a concert album into the busy schedule; either that, or Steve Albini needs to remix this fucker.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8993-hidden-city-of-taurmond/,Load,2006.0,"If you've ever found yourself yearning for the kind of music that seamlessly blends electronic and acoustic elements, then have I got a treat for you. The genre-bending group Wizardzz has just released their latest offering ""Hidden City of Taurmond"", and it's an adventurous journey through a mystical soundscape. Let's dive in, shall we?

First things first, let's acknowledge the history of this enigmatic band. Wizardzz is a musical collective spearheaded by Brian Gibson, the bassist of Lightning Bolt. For over a decade, Gibson has been constructing otherworldly soundscapes that can only be described as spellbinding. The Wizardzz project was born out of a desire to create a sound that was not confined by the limitations of one genre or instrument. With this album, the band continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in music.

The creative process behind ""Hidden City of Taurmond"" is just as intriguing as the band itself. According to Gibson, the concept for the album was inspired by a dream that he had. In the dream, he found himself trapped in a hidden city that was surrounded by mountains. As he wandered through the city, he encountered strange and fantastical creatures. When Gibson awoke, he immediately set to work bringing this dream to life through the power of his music.

One can hear the dream-like quality that permeates through the album. From the opening track ""The Path"", listeners are invited on a journey through an otherworldly realm. Soft acoustic guitar strumming fades into a hypnotic synthesizer melody that sets the tone for the entire album. The listener is transported to a place that's both serene and unsettling, a place where anything is possible.

""Hidden City of Taurmond"" is an album that truly rewards active and attentive listening. The layers of sound are meticulously crafted, with each instrument and sound effect adding to a larger whole. The highlight of the album is the title track, ""Hidden City of Taurmond"". It's a sprawling masterpiece that clocks in at over 14 minutes. The track unfolds at a leisurely pace, each element revealed in its own time. The listener is taken on a journey through a city that's both beautiful and dangerous.

Now, for my personal experience and opinion. I have to admit that I was initially skeptical when I heard that the album was classified as ""nan"". However, after listening to ""Hidden City of Taurmond"", I can say that I'll be revisiting this genre more often. The album has a certain hypnotic quality that makes it difficult to listen to just once. The instrumentation is impressive, and the atmosphere is consistently engaging.

Overall, ""Hidden City of Taurmond"" is an impressive achievement that demonstrates the boundless possibilities of music. Wizardzz has crafted an album that's both ethereal and grounded, a feat that many musicians strive to achieve but fall short of. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I implore you to give it a chance. You may just find yourself entranced by the hidden city of Taurmond.","1.

Cold War Kids,Mine Is Yours,"Electronic,Rock",3.9,January 26 2011,Zach Kelly,Contributor,"Cold War Kids have made a name for themselves crafting the kind of faceless, nondescript brand of blues- and soul-injected indie rock that is working well for many of their bettors. After the success of their ubiquitous first big single ""Hang Me Up to Dry"" five years ago, it wasn't long before they had been lumped in with indie mainstays like the Black Keys. Perhaps buoyed by Black Keys' deserved success, Mine Is Yours finds Cold War Kids aiming for a decidedly more arena-friendly style, going so far as to enlist the help of Jacquire King, the producer who helped push fellow cheese-merchants Kings of Leon in a similar direction over the course of their previous two breakthrough records. So, good for them, Cold War Kids are clearly making a bid for that kind of mainstream acceptance here, infusing their wishy-washy, blue-lit sound with a schmaltzy bigness that matches the heft of the religious and romantic in their music. More streamlined than their older music, Mine Is Yours' relative simplicity allows its songs to more transparently deal with love lost and found. Alas, the presentation couldn't be any more comically bombastic and melodramatic, and the idea of these guys splitting a bill with Coldplay or Kings of Leon would still seem like a bit of reach; maybe Train. Most of the material here can be pretty easily tied-in with the goofy, love-and-life-affirming modern rock radio staples that share more with the likes of James Blunt or Lifehouse than the indie heavy-hitters they once found themselves awkwardly rubbing shoulders with. Even though songs like ""Finally Begin"" and ""Louder Than Ever"" are likely to inspire generic, arms-wide-open sing-alongs, Cold War Kids still find themselves trying to conjure the spirits of their former would-be contemporaries. ""Sensitive Kid"" amateurishly toys with Spoon's fractured stabs of piano, electronic percussion, and obtuse grooves; ""Out of the Wilderness"" attempts to replicate the majestic epicness of Funeral-era Arcade Fire, but instead lurches about uncomfortably like a tangled marionette. One important thing to note is that Cold War Kids certainly haven't made a boring record. Where their previous two just sort of poked about, Mine Is Yours thrives on mishandled, overwrought emotional extremes. ""Skip the Charades"" confidently runs with a metaphor so face-palmingly silly, you'll be able to forgive just about anything. And even though frontman Nathan Willett has clearly taken strides to even out his voice, he's adopted an unlikable, smirky croon, made even more painfully noticeable when he's spouting out gems like, ""It's a slippery slope, like that Mouse Trap game"". Only on ""Cold Toes on the Cold Floor"" can we recant the ragtag jubilation of something like ""Hang Me Up to Dry"", but it too is a false alarm. Trying to impart a little spontaneity into an otherwise coldly calculated effort, Willett calls for ""One more!"" round of the chorus. Its careful placement tellingly reveals the false humanism at the heart of Mine Is Yours, an album which ultimately exhausts itself trying to convince you it's not as empty as it actually is.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15026-mine-is-yours/,Interscope,2011.0,"If you're a fan of the Cold War Kids, then you're probably familiar with their signature indie-rock sound. So when they came out with their third LP, ""Mine Is Yours,"" with a strong electronic influence, it raised more than a few eyebrows. As someone who's been following the band since their early days, I was curious about how this new sound would play out. The result? Well, it depends on what you're looking for. 

First, a little history. Cold War Kids originally formed in 2004 in Fullerton, California. They quickly built a following with raw, passionate performances and a distinctive sound that blended blues, soul, and indie rock. Their first two albums, ""Robbers & Cowards"" and ""Loyalty to Loyalty,"" cemented them as a band with a lot to say and an unshakable sense of style. However, things took a turn with ""Mine Is Yours."" 

The album was produced by Jacquire King, who has worked with artists like Kings of Leon and Spoon. King aimed to capture the band's intensity but with a more polished and streamlined approach. Cold War Kids traded in their vintage guitars and bluesy riffs for synthesizers and dancey beats. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely a departure from their previous work. 

From the opening track, ""Mine Is Yours,"" you can hear the influence of electronic music. The synths are layered over Nathan Willett's distinctive vocals and Matt Maust's bass lines, creating an interesting texture. ""Louder Than Ever"" and ""Royal Blue"" also incorporate electronic elements. These songs are catchy and would definitely make for great dance party material. 

However, this newfound sound comes at a cost. Where the band once had raw energy, now they feel more produced and calculated. ""Bulldozer"" and ""Sensitive Kid"" are examples of this. They have more of a ballad feel, but they lack the grit and authenticity that fans have come to expect from Cold War Kids. 

The standout on this album is ""Finally Begin."" It's a beautiful song that showcases Nathan Willett's vocal range and the band's ability to craft a compelling melody. It's a nice break from the otherwise heavily electronic-influenced tracks. 

Overall, ""Mine Is Yours"" is not the Cold War Kids' strongest effort. However, it's not a complete failure either. If you're a fan of electronic music, you might enjoy this album. If you're a fan of the band's earlier work, it might take a little bit of adjustment. Personally, I think they're strongest when they're sticking to their roots, but I can appreciate them for trying something new.","1.

Magnolia Electric Co.,Fading Trails,Rock,7.4,September 13 2006,Zach Baron,,"Though Fading Trails is more minor-key, and less allusive, than past Magnolia Electric Co. efforts-- there are fewer baseball references and cruel women-- it would a mistake to write this record off as the product of diminishing returns. The ghost-moons and wolf-Christs with which Jason Molina pays homage to the blues, again and again, are not lyrical crutches, but attempts to build through repetition. He's a romantic, conjuring up handfuls of dust and crescent moons, empty baseball diamonds, and lost horizons in the service of a vision of a world that doesn't quite exist, though we might all feel, at one time or another, as though we've glimpsed it. On the first Magnolia Electric Co. album, Molina had his own heart split in two, and his response was the only one we could expect: ""Half I'm going to use/ To pay this band/ Half I'm saving because I'm going to owe them."" His stoic devotion to his own craft even over his own heart is, like it was and still is for Bob Dylan, both myth and more or less the truth. The only thing that matters to him, even above his own songs, is the freedom to play them, which is why Molina's project is intelligible only as an ongoing one. In recording sessions, he regularly tosses out whole records and writes new ones on the spot. His live sets are populated with songs he wrote as recently as that day. Those like myself who miss Songs: Ohia, because they prefer directness over guitar solos and vulnerability over big chords, can comfort themselves with the fact that in the continuum of Molina's music, everything is equally yesterday's news and, at the same time, the beginning of yet another song. On Fading Trails, Molina leans on the blues because there's nothing else to lean on. ""Maybe if I send back the blues/ Her broken heart/ She'll send back my mine,"" he wonders on ""A Little at a Time"", then asks, ""You can't lose it all at once, can you really?"" The blues hold his heart and his life ransom. ""A Little"", like opener ""Don't Fade on Me"", is minimal and twangy in the manner of Songs:Ohia's Didn't It Rain, on which cymbals kept time like rain and acoustic guitars were footsteps on dark, unlit and gravelly roads. And the electric flourishes of Magnolia Electric here feel more like weather than the oft-cited Neil Young or Warren Zevon, all ominous snarls and quick flashes of slide guitar. ""Don't fade on me,"" he begs, but everyone besides his band always does. So what's left? ""Harmony onward, friend"" is Fading Trails' one boast, nestled among ""Lonesome Valley""'s organ plunks and slide flourishes. He's chosen solos and a backing band over touring and recording by himself, because being able to play every night, rain or shine, is the only redemption he believes in, and the more people, the more music. But just because Molina's in man-at-the-brink, guitar-in-hand mode doesn't mean Fading Trails is a recast of What Comes After the Blues and the Hard to Love a Man EP. Nor does it account for the Songs:Ohia records, which in my book are consistently better front to back-- less because I liked the old arrangements more (which I did), but because he soft-pedaled and sold his lesser songs better. I'd say Fading Trails is the best Magnolia's done, unless you count the nominally Songs:Ohia-made Magnolia Electric Co., which I do, and which is still the best Molina product out. Still, Fading Trails better synthesizes the old solo Molina with the post-Newport 65, as it were, Molina. There are more gems in gem form (some otherwise great Magnolia songs have turned out merely good, due to the way-long guitar breaks between practically every line)-- say, ""Don't Fade on Me"", ""A Little at a Time"", and ""Steady Now""-- and less full-on, Zevon guitar bleat on the ostensible burners. Best is how fully realized Molina's always meta-blues have become, how his whole mythology is finally looking in the mirror and acknowledging mutual dependence, if not real love. Molina, increasingly, is singing not at himself, the hard-to-love-man, but at the very Midwestern blues he's always been trying to create. ""Nothing lives for nothing,"" sings Molina, and he is figuring out song-by-song what's opposite those voids",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9396-fading-trails/,Secretly Canadian,2006.0,"Magnolia Electric Co. is a band that has always been on my radar. Their ability to combine rock, country, and folk into a cohesive sound is second to none. So when I heard they were releasing a new album, I was understandably excited. After listening to Fading Trails, I can confidently say that this is one of their best releases yet.

For those unfamiliar with Magnolia Electric Co., they began as the solo project of Jason Molina, who was also the frontman for Songs: Ohia. Over time, Molina recruited new members, and the band morphed into a full-fledged rock outfit. Tragically, Molina passed away in 2013 due to complications from alcoholism, ending a prolific and influential career.

Fading Trails, released in 2006, is the band's fourth studio album. It was recorded live over three days at a studio in Chicago, which lends a certain energy and immediacy to the performances. The album features contributions from some of indie rock's biggest names, including Steve Albini and Lawrence Peters.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Lonesome Valley,"" a slow-burning ballad with haunting lyrics and a sparse arrangement. Molina's voice is in fine form here, conveying an overwhelming sense of sadness and longing. The guitar work is also exceptional, with shimmering chords and delicate fingerpicking adding to the emotional weight of the song.

Another highlight is ""Don't Fade on Me,"" a rollicking rock tune with a catchy chorus and driving rhythm. The song features some of the album's most upbeat and optimistic lyrics, with Molina singing about a love that will never fade. The guitar solo towards the end of the track is also a standout moment.

Throughout the album, the band displays an impressive range, balancing tender ballads with raucous rockers. They also demonstrate a keen sense of dynamics, with songs building and receding in intensity like waves crashing on the shore.

As a longtime fan, I may be a bit biased, but I can say with confidence that Fading Trails is a triumph for Magnolia Electric Co. It's a testament to the band's versatility and musicianship, as well as Molina's songwriting. If you're a fan of rock, country, or folk, there's something here for you. It's a shame that we won't be getting any new music from this talented group, but at least we have albums like Fading Trails to remember them by. Overall, I would give this album a solid 8 out of 10.","1.

Anna Meredith,Jet Black Raider EP,Experimental,7.6,August 22 2013,Brian Howe,Contributor,"The contemporary composer's life is a complicated thing. Not only are there commissions to be written and personal works to be performed, but there are musicians, academic directors, tony labels, demanding benefactors, and gala-happy chamber arts societies to be placated. Not only is there the classical canon and instrumentation to be managed; there are also all kinds of electronic devices and experiments to be integrated, not infrequently amid multidisciplinary performance settings. And if navigating this demanding new music world isn't enough, there's the indie one it increasingly mingles with, sending you scampering between campus auditoriums and nightclub stages. Scottish composer Anna Meredith knows what it's like to keep such a complex machine of prestige and exigency humming along. She has been a composer-in-residence at the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. She's made classically trained young people perform something like a goofy symphonic version of Steve Reich’s Clapping Music at Royal Albert Hall. She's padded her income with commercial work including, reportedly, music for MRI scanners. That's a terrifying prospect if you consider it through the lens of her solo style, which is shaping up-- understandably, given the aforementioned context-- as a pressure vent for overwhelming, spontaneous, brazen grandeur. Would you want to hear Death Star explosion music while getting your brain scanned in a metal pod? Meredith unveiled her smart, intrepid electronic music last year on the Black Prince Fury EP, which was steeped in a sense of adventure associated with the fantasy video games and fantasy metal of the 1980s, when Meredith was a child. The EP was spearheaded by ""Nautilus"", a sentient tidal wave of synthetic brass pulses more gloriously malevolent than anything cooked up by TNGHT or ripped off the Godzilla soundtrack by Pharoahe Monch. ""I came up with a bit of it, and thought, 'Well, that's a bit ridiculous, but let's just roll with it!'"" Meredith told Pitchfork. On the new Jet Black Raider EP, she adds some real clarinets, glockenspiels, drums, cello, and even singing to her virtual instruments, but otherwise, she picks up in the same retro-flavored, high-spirited, questing mood where she left off. The 8-bit video game scores of the 80s were influenced by medieval music-- its limited polyphony suited the handful of channels you could get on a chip-- and by hair metal guitar solos, for their built-in adrenaline. Video game composers used these channels as maximally as possible, stuffing them with ghoulish chromatic bass lines, runaway arpeggios, and memorably brave or haunting melodic themes. Meredith's solo work feels couched in this dated techno-cultural moment. Her song titles sound like Zelda monsters; her EP names like Final Fantasy summon spells. With the short hair and puffy shirt she wears in promo photos, she would make a great bard at a LARP session. ""Orlok"", which fills the monstrous-banger slot established by ""Nautilus"", begins with a fast sinister progression that makes you feel like you've booted up Wizards & Warriors, then rampages through seven minutes of explosive final-boss music, but with contemplative respites and beats nudged around in time. As on Black Prince Fury, the new EP's initial shock-and-awe campaign is rounded out by three shorter, lighter pieces, though the mercurial ""Unicron""-- imagine if there was such a thing as a pipe organ with a built-in digital sequencer, and it was totally haunted-- nears ""Orlok"" in groaning weight and playful menace, and often feels, as do many of Meredith's tracks, like the brief moment when an orchestra scrambles for a tempo change protracted for a breathlessly long time. The sparse ""Bubble Gun"" is as quirkily schematic as its name, with effervescent arpeggios for bubbles, a bass and some brass chords for the gun. Most surprising is ""ALR"", where Meredith sings ingenuous lyrics in a clear, humble voice over molten electro-pop, melding the breezniess of Au Revoir Simone with the wide-open thrusters of M83. Certainly, Meredith must share Anthony Gonzalez's love of 80s synth-pop; this is someone who twisted apart ""The Power of Love"" on her last EP. But rather than a nostalgic embalming of old feelings, this is rough and ready music that bursts with contemporary inspiration, aiming to flood the synapses and master the senses. Though musical subtleties naturally emerge from Meredith's training and practice, the extroverted impact and unserious charisma of Jet Black Raider is even more admirable and rare.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18393-anna-meredith-jet-black-raider-ep/,Moshi Moshi,2013.0,"Anna Meredith's 'Jet Black Raider EP' is a captivating and innovative piece of work that pushes the boundaries of experimental music. With a rating of 7.6 out of 10, this EP showcases Meredith's ingenuity and adventurous spirit.

For those who aren't familiar with Anna Meredith, she's a Scottish composer, producer, and performer who has a background in classical music. She's known for exploring different genres and sounds, pushing them to their limits, and crafting mesmerizing soundscapes that take the listener on a journey.

The Jet Black Raider EP is the follow-up to her critically acclaimed album 'FIBS' and features four tracks that are distinct in their sound and style. From the opening track 'Sawbones' to the closing track 'Crystalline,' the EP grabs your attention and doesn't let go.

One of the things that make this EP so impressive is the way Meredith blends different musical genres together. She's not afraid to experiment with sounds and create something truly unique. The opening track has a jittery, frenetic quality that's at once thrilling and anxiety-inducing, while the second track 'Moonmoons' has a dreamy, hypnotic quality that's both mesmerizing and haunting.

As I listened to this EP, I found myself getting lost in the sounds and melodies. The tracks are filled with intricate details and nuances that take time to appreciate fully. Meredith is a master at layering different sounds and textures, and that's evident throughout the EP. From the sharp percussion to the atmospheric synths, the EP is a sonic feast that's both complex and accessible.

Overall, the Jet Black Raider EP is a fantastic addition to Anna Meredith's impressive body of work. It's an EP that demands repeated listens to fully appreciate the intricacies and subtle qualities of the music. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an adventurous and exciting musical journey.","1.

Pale Young Gentlemen,Pale Young Gentlemen,Rock,6.9,November 27 2007,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Too much Black Kids. Not enough black people. Congrats-- you're caught up on the last month of ""why indie rock sucks"" and prepared to dismiss the blog-approved, self-released album from Pale Young Gentlemen on principle. Oh, if only it were 2005 again for these guys! Their penny orchestra sound is just enough off the beaten path to raise notice and the cutesy DIY details can fill out the rest (there's a song called ""Clap Your Hands"" and anyone who received this record by mail now has the drummer's address). But if people are really willing to stem the process of thrusting embryonic bands into unjustified shitstorms of press, more power to Pale Young Gentlemen, as their eponymous debut is a lean 30 minutes that's better served as a springboard to something greater, equally balanced promise and ""not there yet."" Pale Young Gentlemen employ a female cellist, but the band name is most definitely not used for ironic purposes. Though it starts with a sinister riff that could pass for Miami bass gone acoustic, the opener has a bold chorus pining for the ""milk white glory"" of an unattainable ""Fraulein"" with a classic piano-pop melody. From Beirut's heat-n-serve Franco-Americanisms to Gogol Bordello's Balky/Balkan dance of joy, indie European vacations are becoming more frequent, but the Gentlemen opt towards hitting the Great White North with a frequency that must play well in their home state of Wisconsin. The first half of the album plays closest to this style, with jumpy upbeat rhythms and stein hoisting chorales that ratchet the bawdiness of ""Me & Nikolai"" (""we saw her standing there/ she was in her underwear"") and prop up the good-timey Supertramp vamps of ""Saturday Night"". The self-released and self-produced aspect isn't a canard either, as there's a natural sound that renders the guitars paper thin, places the vocals front and center and has every other instrument sounding direct to tape. Usually, you're supposed to extrapolate how a beefier budget could make this better, but it's quite the opposite here. It's easy to imagine the wintry quietude of piano ballad ""As a War"" drowning in symphonic goo or the rippling ""Up North"" (a two-minute love letter about escaping to Canada) being robbed of its innocent charm. Singer Mike Reisenauer becomes a make-or-break proposition, as his falsetto dangerously courts Chris Martin parody, and he often confuses overpronunciation (""mother"" becomes ""mortar"") with theatricality-- ""Clap Your Hands"" grabs the listener with the most force, but there's an affected, overly fussy nature to it (""Click your heels/ Dance, dance/ Grab your girl/ Dance, dance"") that's a little too Panic! at the Beer Hall for its own good. But while Pale Young Gentlemen is frontloaded and slightly naÃ¯ve like a record of this sort should be, there's more than enough reason to anticipate what they're capable of when they decide to get darker, older, and less gentle.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10876-pale-young-gentlemen/,Self-released,2007.0,"Hello, my dear music aficionados! Today, we're going to dive deep into the world of Pale Young Gentlemen's eponymous album, an eclectic and intriguing dive into the world of indie rock!

Before we delve into the music, let's take a brief look at this Madison, Wisconsin-based band's history. Pale Young Gentlemen come from humble beginnings, forming in 2006 and carving out a reputation for themselves with their unique blend of chamber pop and indie folk. They quickly gained a following, with fans being drawn to their lush melodies and engaging lyrics.

Now, onto the album itself! 'Pale Young Gentlemen' is a rocking and rollicking affair, with the band showing off their rock sensibilities amid their usual chamber pop stylings. 'Saturday Night' kicks things off with a driving beat and soaring vocals, setting the tone for the album's energetic and propulsive feel.

However, it's not all riffs and chords. 'Fiction' and 'Fraulein' are haunting and atmospheric, with the band showcasing their versatility and capacity for melancholic beauty. There's a sense of playfulness to the music that keeps things engaging and unpredictable.

But, overall, the album's standout tracks are the more upbeat and rock-infused numbers like 'Our History' and 'Clap Your Hands'. The former is a thrilling and catchy ode to the band's past, while the latter is an infectious party anthem that will have you tapping your feet and clapping along with the music.

In my opinion, 'Pale Young Gentlemen' is a solid and enjoyable listening experience, showcasing the band's songwriting talents and rock sensibilities. While perhaps not as groundbreaking or revolutionary as some of their contemporaries in the indie rock world, the album delivers plenty of memorable and catchy tunes that will have you coming back for more.

Jimi Tents,5 O'Clock Shadow,Rap,7.9,January 8 2016,Jay Balfour,Contributor,"Jimi Tents seems like a subdued 19 year old. ""I'm depressed and faded,"" he confesses early on his debut project, a short EP called 5 O'Clock Shadow. That self-medicated crossroads isn't so unique for his age, after all, but the debut's sustained gloom stands out. The release is Tents' lone calling card, and at times he's rightfully fussed with how to frame the project. A couple months after releasing the original 7-track EP the Brooklyn rapper expanded the effort into a full LP of the same name. It seemed like he was testing the waters, and while the album fleshes out a more formal introduction, the streamlined original still carries the best work. Tents has a breathless baritone that allows him to stretch out long phrases and carry a hook. The production on 5 O'Clock Shadow, overseen by the Vamp, is warm with embedded instrumentation, a brand of soulful easy-listening that begs for the punctuation of a singer. As a rapper Tents sculpts his verses out carefully, sometimes to the unfortunate point of leaning on familiar tropes. Still, he has an obvious sense for structure, and while the EP has several guests they're usually added voices instead of featured characters. On the opener, ""The Way,"" Tents is overly cautious about the prospect of his music career and it's immediately apparent how much pressure he's placed on this outing. It's the Tunji Ige-assisted hook that pulls you in though, a ghostly chant about taking over that hits its mark. Tents seems quietly apart from New York City's hip-hop scene: geographically he's from way out in East New York, Brooklyn, and figuratively he's adjoined to a crew called SLEEPERcamp, a burgeoning collective taking calculated steps to establish a brand in small doses. (Tents and crewmember Jay Bel were briefly managed by behind-the-scenes TDE coordinator Anthony ""Moosa"" Tiffith Jr.) The track ""All of It"" brings in KeithCharles Spacebar of Atlanta's in-the-moment Awful Records, who joins Tents for an uncharacteristic-to-the-project trap sound. It seems like Tents is saying, ""I can fit in this lane too,"" before burrowing back into his own character-building. ""Landslide"" is the lone upbeat number here, a cheerful standout that both the EP and Tents use to stay afloat. ""Elmer Fudd,"" Tents' original debut single released almost a year ago, bears out his somberly-executed charms: a knack for melody and precise delivery. ""If a body drop in the hood, and no one around, does it make noise?"" he asks. The whole debut carries that straight-forward polish; repeated listens won't necessarily bear out lyrical revelations, but the foundation is sound. In that way 5 O'Clock Shadow pulls off a professional introduction like a firm handshake and practiced party chatter, an accomplished first impression more than a winding conversation.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21378-5-oclock-shadow/,Vate,2015.0,"Greetings music lovers!

Today, I want to talk about Jimi Tents' '5 O'Clock Shadow' album. This record, released in 2017, is a gem that needs to be appreciated by all rap enthusiasts. With a rating of 7.9 out of 10, you can expect a thrilling music experience that will leave you craving for more.

For those who don't know, Jimi Tents is a Brooklyn-based rapper who rose to fame with his debut mixtape '5 O'clock Shadows' in 2015. He has been making music since he was 13 years old, and his passion for music is reflected in every single track on this album.

'5 O'Clock Shadow', his second album, has a unique story behind its creation. Tents said that he was going through a rough patch with his label and was struggling to find inspiration to create new music. However, he did not let this setback defeat him. In fact, it inspired him to push himself further and create something that would leave a mark on the industry.

And boy, did he do just that! '5 O'Clock Shadow' is a masterpiece that showcases Tents' musical genius. From the opening track 'Live It Up' to the closing track 'Domino Effect,' every single song is carefully crafted and tells a story that is relatable to anyone who has ever gone through the ups and downs of life.

One track that stands out for me is 'Should've Called Pt. 2.' This song is a sequel to Tents' 2015 hit 'Should've Called,' and it speaks about the regret that comes with not making the right decisions in life. The lyrics are so poignant, and Tents' delivery is on point, making it one of the best tracks on the album.

Another track that caught my attention is 'All of It.' The beat is infectious and the chorus is catchy, making it a perfect track to jam to at a party. But beyond the excellent production value, the lyrics are also meaningful, speaking about Tents' struggle to make it big in the music industry and the sacrifices he had to make along the way.

Overall, '5 O'Clock Shadow' is an album that deserves to be listened to, not just once, but over and over again. Jimi Tents has truly outdone himself with this release, and it is no wonder why he is considered one of the best rappers in the game right now.

In conclusion, if you are a fan of rap music or just looking for some great music to add to your playlist, give '5 O'Clock Shadow' a chance.

Mitski,Bury Me at Makeout Creek,Rock,7.7,November 14 2014,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Yo La Tengo. Fall Out Boy. And, upon the release of her third album Bury Me at Makeout Creek, Mitski. These three are just about the only rock musicians to successfully reference “The Simpsons” (we’ll leave out metalcore bros Evergreen Terrace for a number of reasons)—a small group considering the show's incalculable influence on people who listen to indie rock. Here’s some context for this particular nod: the cosmic punching bag Milhouse undergoes a fake faith healing ritual that he believes has restored his vision. Caught up in a rapturous song and dance number, he is promised a rare romantic tryst at the apocryphal Makeout Creek. He then gets hit by a truck. With his last bit of breath, he says this album title. That more or less mirrors the narrative arc here. Opener ""Texas Reznikoff"" establishes contemporary comparisons—Mitski’s broad, tremulous vocals and sly humor recall Angel Olsen, while the equal split between unencumbered acoustic pining and pummeling, mid-fi indie rock respectively aligns her with labelmates Frankie Cosmos and LVL UP. And it lays out a compact scene of domestic bliss, littered with specificities—a lover who wears socks in bed, reads Objectivist poetry, and serves as the breeze in her Austin nights. The final acknowledgement of romantic contentment occurs less than three minutes into Bury Me at Makeout Creek and by its bitter end, the only thing that can bring Mitski comfort is the thought of dying with a clean apartment (""They'll think of me kindly/ When they come for my things""). The way an outsider might view her narrator is duly noted just by the loaded title of ""Townie""—this is someone who’s stuck around far too long after the party ended and almost certainly has a distorted perspective as to whether it was any fun to begin with. “Townie” previews a horrible night out with all the protraction and morbid glee of a suicide pact. Her images are startlingly violent—she wants a love that falls like a body from the balcony, she’s holding her breath with a baseball bat. Guzzling a toxic Pinkerton cocktail of redlining distortion, white-hot self pity, and sing-along hooks, Mitski shouts, ""I’m not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be...I'm gonna be what my body wants me to be,"" a call for freedom that's galvanizing from a teenage perspective, but increasingly sad as songs like ""I Don't Smoke"" and ""Drunk Walk Home"" lay out the terrible life plan the body of this self-described 25 year-old ""tall child"" has for her. Though not necessarily nostalgia, the sound of Bury Me at Makeout Creek is inventive and resourceful in a '90s-indie way. The choruses here soar like power pop, but are subdued by tempo and fidelity, while cheap drum machines are deployed as much for their tone as their rhythm. And even when Bury Me has full band arrangements, everything calls attention to the narrator's loneliness—awkwardly thumbed basslines, slapdash drumming, a mocking chorale on ""Carry Me Out"", organ drones that could pass for someone nodding off on the keys. But anything that gives you the sense of amateurism or self-defeat has intent and purpose. As tempting as it is to praise Bury Me at Makeout Creek by trying to quantify its intangibles—charm, relatability—the craft here is obvious, as is the accruing confidence of someone who’s developed a compelling voice in obscurity. Mitski can lay on the emo melodrama (""One word from you/ And I would jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby"") just enough so things aren’t too real and mundane, and while these songs are first-person and personal, they're meant for an audience. It’s fitting to see a mutual respect between herself and Joyce Manor, whose Never Hungover Again is a similarly fantastic record of pop gems about choosing self-pity over feeling nothing at all and finding a kind of pleasurable agency in it. And as a result, Mitski Miyawaki is starting to gain a bit of separation from her band; Bury Me at Makeout Creek still sounds like a breakthrough even if nothing’s coming up Mitski in these songs.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19990-mitski-bury-me-at-makeout-creek/,Double Double Whammy,2014.0,"Bury Me at Makeout Creek by Mitski is a true masterpiece of the rock genre, and a must-listen for any fan of alternative music. The album is a perfect representation of Mitski's talent and showcases her incredible ability to express deep emotions through catchy melodies and powerful lyrics.

Mitski, born in Japan and raised in the United States, has been making music since 2012. Her previous albums, Lush and Retired from Sad, New Career in Business, established her as one of the most exciting talents in the rock scene. However, with Bury Me at Makeout Creek, Mitski's sound took on a new level of maturity and intensity.

The album's creation story is nearly as impressive as the music itself. After finishing her previous tour, Mitski felt a need to create music that felt more personal and raw. She holed up in her parents' home in New Jersey and spent months writing and recording the tracks that would become Bury Me at Makeout Creek.

The resulting album is a work of art that is both introspective and explosive. Mitski's voice ranges from a whisper to a scream, and her lyrics tackle themes of loneliness, heartbreak, and the struggle of finding self-acceptance.

Tracks like ""First Love / Late Spring"" and ""Townie"" are perfect examples of Mitski's ability to craft powerful melodies that stick with the listener long after the album has finished. The guitar riffs on ""Jobless Monday"" and ""I Will"" also showcase Mitski's musical prowess and add a refreshing edge to the album.

One of the most impressive things about Bury Me at Makeout Creek is the way it balances heavy subject matter with moments of lightness and humor. For instance, on ""Drunk Walk Home,"" Mitski sings about feeling lost and alone, yet the infectious chorus manages to be both catchy and uplifting.

As a fan of the rock genre, I was blown away by Mitski's ability to convey such complex emotions through her music. Bury Me at Makeout Creek is a true gem and a testament to Mitski's talent and creativity. I give this album a solid 7.7 out of 10 and urge music fans to give it a listen.","Step-by-step reasoning:

Lost in the Trees,Past Life,Rock,7.0,February 3 2014,Brian Howe,Contributor,"Dancing is not an activity one typically associates with the North Carolina orchestral indie-folk band Lost in the Trees, a group that has traditionally been too focused on going for the emotional jugular to worry much about moving listeners' feet. But dancing, in a light spring rain, is exactly what I found myself doing when they rolled out some new songs at famed Carrboro venue Cat's Cradle's block party last May. Their stolid rock drums were newly tinged with a disco tick-tock; an electronic sequencer pulsed out fleet arpeggios beneath the live musicianship. These surprising changes are reflected on fourth LP Past Life, which should still have enough sentimental grist to satisfy old fans while broadening the band's appeal to people who prefer a little more dynamism in their dolor. Part of the reason for the change is a reduction in personnel from a sextet to a quartet, and the band also worked with an outside producer, Nicolas Vernhes (Deerhunter, Dirty Projectors), for the first time. In becoming leaner and less hermetic, Lost in the Trees seems to have freed itself from its habitual pomp. There are still the ringing guitars of indie rock, the vaporous harmonies of choral music, and the vigorous string and piano arrangements of classical. And as always, bandleader Ari Picker's lofty tenor is a pleasure to hear, especially as it rises over the prickling guitar of album highlight ""Daunting Friend"". But while it was always a stretch to call a six-piece ""orchestral,"" this chamber-music-sized lineup definitely sheds the excess the term might imply, and while Picker is a canny writer for strings and piano, he seems more focused on giving the songs stiff spines than frilly embroideries. The resulting music is refreshingly streamlined and direct. The atmospheric ""Excos"" opens the album on a familiar note, with shimmering, panning cymbals and a slow curl of piano opening out from the slightly distorted choral lines of Emma Nadeau. But the band's new look quickly presents itself on the title track, an anthem taut with lyrical electric guitar work and a juddering electronic undercarriage. The thick, pumping bass of songs such as ""Lady in White"" and ""Wake"" introduces a facet that has seldom been heard in Lost in the Trees' chaste music—sex—while standout deep cut ""Sun"" shows that they can also bring their new energy to the kind of feather-light songs on which they made their name. The lyrics still strike at grand notes: Angels zip around, light comes out of hearts, and birds, somehow, come out of eyes. But death, still lurking after the difficult memorial album A Church That Fits Our Needs, adds a newly earned gravity and wisdom to the proceedings without being the focus. Picker remains good at creating a sense of towering scale and charged atmosphere, and the heavenly light that suffuses his music takes on a more humble and terrestrial hue, for the better. Picker sounds revivified, as if he's having more fun, and the feeling is mutual. After they've spent so long swirling high up in the rarified air, it's exciting to hear Lost in the Trees planting their music so firmly in the body, their feet on the ground, tapping.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18910-lost-in-the-trees-past-life/,Anti-,2014.0,"Lost in the Trees' ""Past Life"" is a hauntingly beautiful album that explores themes of nostalgia, love, and loss. Rooted in the rock genre, this album offers a unique blend of sounds and emotions that create a truly captivating listening experience. With a rating of 7.0 out of 10, this album offers a lot to unpack - from its intriguing backstory to the mesmerizing music within.

For those unfamiliar with Lost in the Trees, the band has been around since 2007 when lead singer Ari Picker founded it as a solo project. Over time, the band evolved into a collaborative effort, which led to the release of several albums over the years. ""Past Life"" is their fourth studio album, released in 2014, and it's a concept album based on Picker's personal experiences.

The album's creation story is just as intriguing as the music itself. According to Picker, this album was born out of a dark time in his life. He experienced heartbreak, lost a close friend to suicide, and struggled with depression. He channeled these emotions into the creation of this album, which he describes as a ""therapeutic"" process. This shines through in the music, which is emotionally charged and introspective, with tracks that touch on themes of grieving, acceptance, and moving on.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Daunting Friend,"" which is driven by an ethereal piano melody and soaring vocals. The song feels like a tribute to Picker's friend who passed away, with poignant lyrics like ""I miss the light that shone from you / Whenever you were around."" The track is both melancholic and uplifting, with a sense of raw emotion that resonates with the listener.

Another standout track is ""Excos,"" which has a more upbeat and experimental sound. The song opens with the sound of birds chirping before launching into a driving beat and catchy harmonies. With lyrics like ""I'm falling for the world, but I'm lifted up,"" this song feels like a declaration of hope in the face of adversity.

As a listener, I found myself completely drawn into the stories and characters that Picker weaves throughout the album. The music is intricate and layered, with each track offering something unique and compelling. The band's use of orchestral elements, like violins and cellos, adds a depth and complexity to the music that elevates it beyond traditional rock.

Overall, ""Past Life"" is an impressive album that showcases Lost in the Trees' versatility and emotional depth. The lyrics are thoughtful and introspective, while the music is powerful and moving. While it may not be for everyone, those who are intrigued by a blend of rock and orchestral elements and enjoy introspective lyrics will likely find it to be a fascinating and rewarding listen.","Step 1: Look for natural, smooth and logical flow of the review.

John Zorn,Masada Guitars,"Experimental,Jazz",7.7,January 29 2003,Chris Dahlen,,"If you've ever seen John Zorn at a gig with his Masada quartet, you might have noticed him flipping through a thick sheath of music as he picks the next tune. That pile of paper holds the 208 compositions that he's written for the band. The tunes cross the style of the early Ornette Coleman Quartet with themes from Jewish folk music, and they can sound as slow and exotic as a nightcrawl through the desert, or whiz past with knotty themes and quick changes played at breakneck speed. That's the Masada songbook. Zorn arranged it for a band that included himself on alto, Dave Douglas on trumpet, bassist Greg Cohen, and the inimitable Joey Baron on drums. Arguably his best ensemble, he also made it one of the most recorded groups in jazz, cutting almost 20 studio and live albums in under a decade-- so many records that unless you're one of their mothers, you're unlikely to have heard them all. Zorn even farmed out some of those 200+ tunes to his chamber ensemble Bar Kokhba, and collected others on his 1998 release, The Circle Maker. And it doesn't stop. This year Zorn and his label, Tzadik ""Never Say Glut"" Records, has kicked off a new series for the 10th anniversary of Masada. It starts with Masada Guitars, which features solo recitals by three of Zorn's favorite guitarists: Marc Ribot and Bill Frisell, his main axemen of the 90s and 80s respectively, and the classically trained Tim Sparks, who has recorded for Tzadik's Radical Jewish Culture series. This disc is almost indulgently long, crammed with 21 similar pieces that get dignified, mid-tempo readings. That's a lot of samey acoustic guitar to wade through, and the fact that it's all pretty doesn't justify the length. But the upside is that Zorn knows where he's going, and he knows what he wants from these guitarists; he's just willing to give them a lot of chances to hit it. Take Tim Sparks, whose classical approach-- treating the songs like the lost works of Segovia-- is rigorous and exciting. His bright, ringing tone and refined ornamentation beautifully embellish ""Kodashim"" and ""Sippur""; and his measured exploration of ""Kedushah"" heightens the richness of its ethnic themes. By contrast, Marc Ribot is the most plain-spoken of the three. He makes no extra gestures: He thumps and strikes out the rhythms, as on the tango-like ""Kivah"", and his harsh attack tangles the melody of ""Galgalim"" in his strings. His steady, dry progression across ""Sansanah"" best demonstrates the patience and effort in his readings. This makes Bill Frisell the maverick. Instead of sticking to acoustic guitar, he unpacks his electric and all of his gizmos: On ""Katzatz"", he takes the fast melody and warps, loops and splinters it around itself, nicely invoking the Masada quartet's spastic catchiness. And yet Frisell's finest moments happen on the acoustic, in the ballads ""Abidan"" and ""Avelut"". More than most high-powered guitarists, Frisell loves to surrender to a good melody: In his hands these ballads' stately themes achieve a hushed beauty, with pauses that hang like the quiet moments of a ceremony. The only problem is Zorn's need to cram in so many of his songs. Zorn is a solid composer, but in his best music, the compositions are no more critical than his choice of performers, his skill as a band leader, and the room he leaves for improvisation. Which is all critic-speak for saying that few of these pieces hit it out of the park. But maybe the point isn't to nail any one song, and instead to interpret the spirit behind the entire Masada project. Each guitarist has brought out a different aspect: In the richness of Sparks' technique, the rigor and labor from Ribot, and the grace in Frisell's ballads, they approach the truth and purity of its themes-- ethnic, historical, and spiritual. In fact, the best parts are so great that they make me stop worrying about how this is the start of a new deluge-- that Zorn probably has another dozen Masada discs in the works, plus half a dozen ""essential"" live albums, and worst of all, the inevitable leftovers discs that'll scoop up every scrap of the songbook that hasn't been committed to plastic. What's Hebrew for ""b-sides?""",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8925-masada-guitars/,Tzadik,2003.0,"If you're a fan of experimental jazz or just enjoy listening to something completely out of the box, then ""Masada Guitars"" by John Zorn is a must-listen. This album is the perfect blend of talent, creativity, and experimentation, with a touch of avant-garde that will make your ears tingle.

John Zorn is no stranger to the experimental jazz music scene, and this album is no exception. The band, which consists of four exceptional guitarists, came together to create an album unlike any other. The album features John Medeski, Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot and Tim Sparks, all respected musicians in their own right but together they achieve something truly magical.

The album's creation story is unique where Zorn, for the first time in his career, wrote music that was not just for jazz but also for rock audience, and he was seeking the input of other guitarists. After doing some extensive research, he found the perfect team who could breathe life into his vision, and that's how ""Masada Guitars"" came to be.

What makes this album stand out is the level of synergy between the musicians. It's clear that they feel comfortable enough to take risks, and it's in those moments of experimentation that we see what true musical genius looks like. The guitarists complement each other's playing styles beautifully and create a sound that is both haunting and electrifying, that keeps you hooked for the duration of the album.

The album opens with ""Mahshav,"" where the guitarists' melodic and skillful playing immediately draws you in. This is followed by ""Kedushah,"" where the band plays with more intensity and brings in some exciting rock elements. ""Hath-Arob"" has a Middle Eastern vibe, while ""Hokhmah"" is a bit more experimental and ventures into avant-garde territory.

The album's highlight is ""Khebar,"" a track that is completely out of this world. It's the perfect example of what this band can do when given free reign to let their imaginations run wild. The guitarists play off each other, creating a sound that is completely improvised, yet it all comes together in perfect harmony.

Overall, ""Masada Guitars"" is an excellent album that showcases the fusion of talent, creativity, and experimentation by John Zorn's ensemble. While not for everyone, the album deserves recognition for its boldness and ambition. If you're looking for something different and exciting, give ""Masada Guitars"" a listen. With a rating of 7.7 out of 10, this album is a must-listen for fans of experimental jazz and those who appreciate true musicianship.","Step-by-step reasoning:

Josh Ritter,The Beast in Its Tracks,Rock,6.8,March 5 2013,Stephen Deusner,Contributor,"Josh Ritter is a big picture kind of songwriter. Eschewing the confessional approach along with overtly personal lyrics, his last two albums were less about himself and more about all of America all at once, as though Ritter were reconstructing John Banvard's panoramic trip down the Mississippi. The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter and So Runs the World Away boast ambitious feats of songwriting and composition, yet his craft often undercut rather than underscored his headiest insights. The music sounded too composed: too predetermined, too polite to adequately depict the chaos and sheer weirdness of history. It makes sense that his best work to date isn't an album or a song, but a novel, Bright's Passage, which blended history and fantasy, grand tragedy and life pre- and post-WWI into imaginative literary fiction. For his seventh full-length, Ritter has abandoned the broad canvas of history. The Beast in Its Tracks is his most ostensibly personal album to date, smaller in scope yet deeper in detail than anything he's done yet. Technically, it's a break-up album, inspired by his divorce from singer-songwriter Dawn Landes. But that label implies messy emotions, lives upended, dishes thrown. Ritter's songs are less about recrimination than recovery. In a letter to fans, he explains that his first songs as an ex-husband were too bitter to record, ""full of hatred and self-pity,"" but time allowed him to gain a new perspective. Rather than recount his precipitous post-split freefall into alcohol and self-loathing, Beast picks up a year or so later, when a new and stable relationship has righted his ship and put him in a more generous mood: ""I've got a new lover now,"" he sings, without boasting. ""I hope you've got a lover, too."" That distance has its advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, it allows Ritter a big-picture perspective: the past as a landscape he has traversed and can see more clearly from this peak. Beast is contemplative and forgiving, a means of burying one relationship to commit to another, and Ritter nicely evokes the excitement and resignation of such a transition. On the other hand, distance is distance, and much of the album is too cool, too levelheaded, too past tense. The spry pace and playful melody of ""Nightmares"" distract from the horrors described in the lyrics, as such nightmares are safely over. The best moments are the rawest and least guarded, when the pain and regret sound inescapably present tense: when he laughs off his insomnia on ""Evil Eye"", when he notices similarities between his new lover and his old wife on ""A Certain Light"", when he finally allows himself to enjoy a bit of happiness on ""Joy to You Baby"". The Beast in Its Tracks forgoes the expansive arrangements of Ritter's previous albums in favor of scaled-back arrangements that emphasize a few instruments interacting directly with each other. The songs build patiently, allowing repeating musical themes to mirror persistent lyrical themes. ""Hopeful"", the album's highlight, opens with a spare acoustic strum, then builds from the ground up: a simple drumbeat, a simple electric guitar pendulum, a one-note piano theme. The effect, however, is surprisingly sophisticated. On that song as well as on ""Bonfire"", Ritter rushes his delivery, packing the measures with as many words as he can. There's a new, anxious energy to his vocals, which gives the sense that he's trying to get his thoughts out before they grow cold or before he loses his nerve. It's an effective and illuminating technique, revealing just how much divorce and recovery have changed Ritter: He seems to understand that all those mixed emotions can't be so easily fit to music.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17673-josh-ritter-the-beast-in-its-tracks/,Pytheas,2013.0,"If there's one thing that Josh Ritter knows how to do, it's how to create a rock album that perfectly captures the essence of life's ups and downs. With 'The Beast in Its Tracks', the singer-songwriter delves into some of the deepest and darkest corners of human emotions, and brings forth a sublime offering of music that's sure to strike a chord with listeners.

At first glance, the album's title might seem a bit ominous, but it's a fitting metaphor for the tumultuous period in Ritter's life that led to its creation. In the aftermath of his divorce, he channeled all of his emotions into his music, resulting in some of the most raw and honest tracks we've ever heard from him.

One of the standout gems on this album is 'Joy to You Baby', a beautifully crafted ode to the realization that even in the midst of heartache, life goes on. With lyrics like ""May the road rise up to meet you / May the wind be at your back / May the sunshine warm your face / And the rain fall softly on your tracks"", Ritter encapsulates the idea that even when things seem bleak, there's always hope for a brighter tomorrow.

Another standout track is 'New Lover', which sees Ritter exploring the ins and outs of moving on and finding a new love. With a catchy hook and a driving rhythm, it's impossible not to tap your toes and sing along. It's the kind of song that makes you want to jump in your car and go for a long, carefree drive.

Of course, not all of the tracks on this album are upbeat and optimistic. 'Hopeful' is a deeply introspective number that reflects on the inevitability of change, and the fear that comes with it. There's a sense of vulnerability and rawness in the lyrics that's both relatable and moving.

Ultimately, 'The Beast in Its Tracks' is a testament to the power of music to help us heal and overcome life's greatest challenges. Josh Ritter's artistry and passion for his craft are on full display here, and it's clear that he poured his heart and soul into every single track. With a solid rating of 6.8 out of 10, this album is a must-listen for fans of rock and anyone who appreciates great songwriting.","1.

AM/FM,Mutilate Us,Rock,7.1,April 30 2001,Rich Juzwiak,Contributor,"In the top right corner of the cover of Mutilate Us, below the bandname and album title, is a quote culled from the LP's title track: ""And if we are the ones that will cross mountains for love/ Then we are the ones that let love mutilate us."" It's hard to think of a tactic that's more self-congratulatory than incorporating lyrics into your cover art, especially when they're also printed in the liner notes. And really, it doesn't benefit much in the way of advertising. The words are just shy of being trite, and bespeak no insight that goes beyond the obvious. Plus, the abstract construct of ""love"" is the crux of the sentiment. So, it's at least a little surprising that scrupulous ex-Franklin member Brian Sokel and multi-instrumentalist Michael Parsell's current project, AM/FM, doesn't come off the least bit smarmy on record. The Philadelphia-based duo's debut full-length is an unpretentious collection of lo-fi, acoustic-based pop tunes bolstered by Sokel's warm delivery. AM/FM has the charm and slightly skewed pop sensibilities of Ween, but in song structure only. Though, come to think of it, fecal humor and hallucinogenic abuse might be intriguing coming from the Polyvinyl camp. Mutilate Us successfully skirts stuffiness with light-hearted sincerity. On the upbeat ""Secretly Odds in Knowing Normal Words,"" Sokel sings, ""You said I was full of shit/ But what's wrong with that?"" backed by bouncy percussion and hand-claps. ""Yours Recklessly"" is minor-keyed, folk territory, not entirely dissimilar from Elliott Smith's recent offerings. It opens on a wobbly solo-acoustic note, but the song's dense, swelling climax is a lovely pay-off. ""Time Flows Much More Slowly This Way"" is almost absurd in its catchiness, and serves as just one of many examples of the adroit songwriting showcased on the album. This doesn't mean, though, that Mutilate Us is as consistently great as the aforementioned tracks. Sokel and Parsell sometimes sink too comfortably into poppiness and end up tripping over yesteryear's indie rock clichÃ©s. ""You and Me at 53"" is pedestrian in its aim to emulate the Cars, and its execution is worse still, echoing latter-day Promise Ring emergencies. ""Leanne, The Seasons Persist"" tends toward emo-pop with quiet, building instrumentation during the verses, but the predictability of the song's explosive between-verse segues render them completely ineffective. Still, the occasional misfires of Mutilate Us are forgivable; like most of the record's tracks, they're brief, often clocking in under two minutes. And when the record is successful, it's like a piston blasting warm guitar pop at incredible speeds. The bulk of the record is so assured that by the time its last lines are sung (those that adorn the album's cover), it's hard to not take their genuineness to heart and believe them.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/144-mutilate-us/,Polyvinyl,2001.0,"AM/FM's 'Mutilate Us' is a compelling album that showcases the band's passion for Rock music.

The Felice Brothers,Favorite Waitress,Rock,5.6,June 17 2014,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"The first vocals on Favorite Waitress aren’t from any of the brothers themselves, but from their dog barking in the background. The shambling, acoustic opener “Bird on Broken Wing” (which is dedicated to the memory of Pete Seeger) is filled with background noise, the bustle of busy bodies barking or conversing or just bumping into things. It’s the kind of ambient noise that might ruin a take by another band or at least get edited out before the song makes its way onto an album. With the Felice Brothers, however, that dog bark conveys a sense of informality, reminding you that the band recorded live and casually, with no regard for polish or perfection. That’s how rock and roll is supposed to be played, right? But it’s even more crucial to Favorite Waitress, which marks the first time the Felices have recorded in a proper studio rather than high schools or chicken coops. For Favorite Waitress, the group piled in a van and drove from their home in Woodstock, New York all the way out to Omaha, Nebraska, workshopping these new tunes along the way. They recorded in Mike Mogis’ Arc Studio, with long-time producer Jeremy Backofen at the helm. Lest you think they’ve cleaned up their sound or abandoned their rowdy and rustic ethos: woof. On the other hand, it’s almost too perfect and planned, as though they set the dog up in his own little booth to get that short exclamation. While the Felices project a world-weary and ramshackle aesthetic, their music is actually very deliberate and calculated. They’re one of surprisingly few acts that can hold a stage with a string band like Old Crow Medicine Show, or with a rock band like Dawes or Deer Tick. Vocalist Ian Felice peppers his lyrics with proper nouns, and to his credit he mixes the old (Henry James) with the new (Harry Potter), as if to suggest the new America is just as weird as the old America. On the other hand, he can barely get away with a line like “I’ll be Butch Cassidy and you can be the Sundance Kid,” from “Meadow of a Dream”. That song just falls apart, thanks to asinine wordplay like, “I ain’t the Boss, but I’m his illegitimate son, ‘cause baby, I was born to run.” That’s worse than anything off High Hopes. Especially after the garish electronic elements and dancehall atmosphere on Celebration, Florida, the Felices play it a bit safer on Favorite Waitress, once again displaying a broad palette—a bit of zydeco here, some piano balladry there, and Band references everywhere else. As a unit, they’re nimble and assured, emphasizing fluid transitions and brazen contrasts between styles. The result is a heady roots rock that flaunts its unpredictability and doggedly strives against convention. On the other hand, for all their Boss and King allusions (“I’m the new Elvis, covered in my enemies’ blood!”), the Felices understand “rock” as a noun, not a verb. These songs lumber and splay, all gangly melodies and world-weary croaks. Even “Woman Next Door”, the fastest and heaviest number here, trips over its own feet as it tries to locate the groove. Too often Favorite Waitress sounds too too clever to accommodate something as visceral as a groove. Only on “Cherry Licorice”, with its spoken introduction and its AABB rhyme scheme, does the band come alive and craft something unself-consciously affecting. The lyrics are goofy and slapdash, as though written seconds before they were sung, and the band backs Ian like they’re drunk and trying to remember how “I Want Candy” goes. “All I want to eat is cherry licorice,” he slurs. “I don’t care if it sounds ridiculous.” That’s precisely how it sounds, which makes it the most joyful and unguarded song on the album.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19452-the-felice-brothers-favorite-waitress/,Dualtone,2014.0,"The Felice Brothers have been a staple in the indie-folk rock genre since their formation in 2006. Their unique blend of Americana, rock and folk has been praised by critics and fans alike. Their latest album, ""Favorite Waitress,"" is an eclectic compilation of both energetic and introspective tracks that showcase their versatility as musicians.

With nine albums under their belt, The Felice Brothers have developed a distinctive sound that is both familiar and fresh. The band's roots can be traced back to their upbringing in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York - an area rich with Appalachian folk tradition. The brothers, Ian and James Felice, teamed up with drummer Greg Farley and bassist Josh Rawson to form the band, and over the years have added various members.

""Favorite Waitress"" was recorded in the basement of a pottery shop in upstate New York, which adds an organic and raw quality. The album was produced by the band themselves and mixed by Jeremy Backofen, giving the album a personal touch.

The opening track, ""Bird on Broken Wing,"" sets the tone with a lively tempo and catchy instrumentals. The Felice Brothers stay true to their folk-rock roots with songs like ""Meadow of a Dream"" and ""Constituents."" These tracks showcase the band's artistic ability to embody complex emotions using vivid imagery and storytelling.

However, ""Favorite Waitress"" also displays the band's willingness to explore new sounds and styles. ""Cherry Licorice"" is an upbeat, experimental track that feels reminiscent of a 70's rock anthem. ""Saturday Night"" is another standout track that explores the theme of the weekend through a bluesy, soulful sound.

While the instrumentation on this album is impressive, the vocals are what truly stand out. Ian Felice's voice is soul-stirring, with a hint of weariness and longing that adds depth to each track. His brother James' backing vocals add depth and complexity, especially in tracks such as ""Woman Next Door"" and ""Lion.""

As I listen to this album, I can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia and warmth. The Felice Brothers' unique style transports me to another time and place, full of possibility and adventure. While some may criticize the band's sound as being too familiar, I find comfort in their consistency and ability to create music with a familiar feel and innovative sound.

In conclusion, ""Favorite Waitress"" is a great addition to The Felice Brothers' discography. It showcases their growth as musicians and their willingness to take risks, all while maintaining their signature sound. I would rate this album a 7 out of 10, as it is a solid effort by the band, but does not quite reach the level of their earlier work. Nonetheless, it is an album that any fan of folk-rock should check out.","1.

Lushlife,Plateau Vision,Rap,6.9,April 16 2012,Hari Ashurst,Contributor,"Back in the early 2000s, mash-up culture had a moment. The ''As Heard on Radio Soulwax'' discs were essential party soundtracks, and a quick flick through music video channels yielded endless Britney and Christina mash-ups. The novelty of matching up disparate genres was primitive but satisfying-- evidenced by nu-metal's regular pairing with bubblegum pop. One high-water mark was Danger Mouse's Jay-Z and Beatles match-making on The Grey Album. Lushlife's similar pairing of the Beach Boys and Kanye on West Sounds in 2005 was his first record. Fast-forward to the present, and Lushlife-- aka producer/MC Raj Haldar-- still seems to be investigating that contrast. That's not to say there's anything crude about the way Halder mixes up genres on Plateau Vision, but what you do get is an Andrew Cedermark (of Underwater Peoples) guest spot on a rap record. That appearance comes on ''The Romance of the Telescope"" where Cedermark is enlisted to sing the hook from the OMD song of the same name (over a sample also culled from the song). The beat hangs in air, spectral and melancholy as Halder points his telescope at South Philly, name-dropping Joy Divison, Maxi Priest, and spitting ""coke rap but sprinkled with the right emotion."" Rap can often be pretty meta with references within references, often to cartoonish real life events (Killa Cam patenting his own color, Kanye's Taylor Swift-gate), and pinpointing submerged narratives is sometimes half of the fun. Halder litters his music with references too, but with the absence of an outré personality, he relies on unexpected name-drops to establish his character-- Burt Bacharach and Zola Jesus are both invoked on opener ""Magnolia"", for instance. These nods make this feel like a nerdy, insular record, and more than anything Halder often comes across like an enthusiastic music fan. There's a lot of heart to this record too, not least in Plateau Vision's dewy-eyed beats: from the gorgeous guitars of ""Big Sur"" to the drumless, music box glow of ""Gymnopedie 1.2"". Halder's nasal rasp sounds good as a counterpoint to his lush, textured beats, and his vocal style harks back to the Roots' Black Thought and Nas. ""Hale-Bopp Was the Bedouins"" is where he shines brightest-- a dark, rumbling beat opening up just enough space as a canvas so his verses stand at the fore for the first time. He nods to the classics, invoking Nas as he posits himself as ""half-Delorean, half-rap historian"" while sounding more aggressive than anywhere else on Plateau Vision. Das Racist's Heems completes an already dark picture, sounding ragged and tough as he finishes the track up. There's probably a little too much emphasis on cultural currency for Halder to ever define himself as a character on Plateau Vision. Regardless there's enough of a sweet spot in the clean, backward-leaning production and offbeat samples to allow the record to distinguish itself as more than a sum of disparate parts.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16500-lushlife-plateau-vision/,Western Vinyl,2012.0,"Plateau Vision by Lushlife: A Creative and Innovative Rap Album

Lushlife has had a compelling journey through the rap genre, and their latest album Plateau Vision further proves that their music style is one of a kind. This 2019 release brings about an innovative integration of different elements of music, making it one of the most creatively inspired rap albums in recent years. 

Plateau Vision is a product of lushlife’s passion for experimenting with eclectic sounds and tastes. Throughout the years, the band has evolved into an iconic hip-hop group, incorporating sounds all the way from experimental electronic music to vintage soul. And with Plateau Vision, they have pushed even farther, going the extra mile to fuse rap with other genres like jazz and rock.

As we listen to Plateau Vision, we can feel the exploration and experimentation of lushlife in every track. We see the band finding new ways of tying together diverse samples and instrumentation, creating a unique soundscape. The album's opening track, ""Still I Hear The Word Progress,"" sets off with the jazzy melody of a trumpet before blending into a heavily distorted bass line. This creative transition shows the level of artistry present in the album, making it stand out among the many other rap albums in the industry.

The lead vocalist, Raj Haldar, also known as Lushlife, has effectively weaved together lyrical masterpieces that blend seamlessly with the background music. The lyrics in Plateau Vision are just as innovative as the music itself, showcasing the band's prowess in poetic intelligence. Tracks such as ""The Waking World"" and ""Depression / Summer"" combine metaphorical verses with storytelling prowess, encapsulating the everyday struggles of human existence.

But as much as Plateau Vision holds such an intense creativity, it is still a rap album, and you can still enjoy all the energetic and upbeat vibes that the genre offers. Tracks like ""The Fall of Lush"" and ""Gymnastics On Fire"" ramp up the energy, revealing the band's versatility and ability to adapt to different rhythmic styles.

In conclusion, If you're looking for an inventive, polished, and gratifying rap album, Plateau Vision by Lushlife certainly fits the bill. Their consistent musical experimentation and artistic evolution prove that the band is always pushing the boundaries of perfection. With a rating of 6.9 out of 10, in my personal opinion, it's an album that is more than worth your time, and a must-listen for fans of the rap genre.","1.

Black Bananas,Electric Brick Wall,Rock,7.7,June 25 2014,Miles Raymer,Contributor,"The 1990s alt-rock boom produced a lot of rock stars who weren’t very good at being rock stars: too glum, too suspicious of the mainstream audience they found themselves playing to, or both at the same time. Few of them really seemed to really relish the role, and the ones who stand out most, looking back from two decades later, were women: Kim Gordon, Courtney Love, and Royal Trux frontwoman Jennifer Herrema. While their contemporaries were imploding the classic rock golden-god mythos through a truculent refusal to follow the rulebook, Herrema and Royal Trux's Neil Hagerty, were accomplishing something similar by emulating its sickest qualities. Falling half-accidentally into a pile of the major label cash that was flying around, Herrema and Hagerty put that money into drugs and druggy records that achieved the same kind of squalid junkie transcendence as Exile on Main Street, with far less romanticism. Their carton-a-day croaks and fucked-up frames represented ""heroin chic"" taken to its scabrous logical conclusion, and they reveled in its repulsiveness to an extent that terminally disconcerted much of the audience that their often achingly beautiful records deserved. The whole project sounded filthy and, somehow, glorious. Unlike a good deal of her contemporaries, Herrema’s continued evolving as an artist since the '90s. After her partnership with Hagerty dissolved following 2000's Pound for Pound, which explored Southern rock and the coke-addled disco side of the late-'70s Stones, she formed and fronted RTX, which added a scuzzy streak of hair metal into the mix. With her latest group, Black Bananas, she’s dragged that whole pile of classic rock influences into the present day. The group’s first album, 2012’s Rad Times Xpress IV, was a weird mishmash of stoner grooves, flamboyant hair metal, and the seedier side of the contemporary club scene, the results sounding like someone dragged 1984-era David Lee Roth into at a basement DJ night and filled him full of cough syrup. It was a mess, but like most messes Herrema’s involved in, it was compelling. Electric Brick Wall is a far more coherent synthesis of those disparate influences, and possibly her strongest record since the Trux’s peak. The album's female-fronted pileup of overblown drum machines and retro guitar riffage shares surface similarities with Sleigh Bells, but instead of that band's shimmering, pixellated gleam, Black Bananas give off a debauched, grimy aura. When they evoke the Sunset Strip in the '80s it’s not the fictionalized version served up by the Motley Crüe wannabes of the time but the seedy real-life version, with rumbling rap beats mixed in for kicks. At other points, the group ditches its retro references and shoots for an almost purely contemporary sound, which Herrema’s seldom attempted previously. “Give It to Me” is a slick (by her standards) take on dance floor electro-pop, while “Physical Emotions” is their take on straight-up radio R&B, complete with Auto-Tune; even with the requisite amount of distortion that they slather on it, it still has a modern sheen that even listeners attuned to Herrema’s wild stylistic impulses won’t see coming. After years spent ransacking the past, she’s turned her sights on the here and now, and it’s as fucked-up and fascinating as anything she’s ever done.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19443-black-bananas-electric-black-wall/,Drag City,2014.0,"Does rock music ever truly die? With the sounds and sensations of Black Bananas' ""Electric Brick Wall,"" I would have to say no. The seventies-style swagger of this album breathes new life into a genre that has seen its share of ups and downs over the years.

Before delving into the music itself, let's take a moment to examine the band's history. Jennifer Herrema, the frontwoman of the band, is no stranger to the rock scene. She famously co-led the band Royal Trux in the early '90s before embarking on a solo career with the band RTX. It was during this period that she met bassist Kurt Midness and formed the original lineup of Black Bananas.

After a few years of touring and recording, the band entered the studio to create ""Electric Brick Wall."" Interestingly, the band approached this album with a more improvisational mindset, resulting in a record that feels manic and spontaneous in the best way possible. From the opening track ""Creeping,"" with its distorted guitar riffs and pulsing synths, to the funky ""Hot Stupid,"" each song feels like a wild ride.

One thing that sets this album apart from others in the genre is its fearless experimentation. The band incorporates psychedelic flourishes, electronic beats, and even dubstep drops into their sound, all while still retaining that classic rock and roll energy. It's a testament to the band's skill that they can experiment so freely without losing their roots.

Each track offers something unique, and it's difficult to choose favorites. However, I have a soft spot for the dreamy ""Give it to Me,"" with its haunting vocals and spacey synths, and the groovy ""TV Trouble,"" which features a standout guitar solo by Brian McKinley.

Ultimately, ""Electric Brick Wall"" is a must-listen for rock fans who crave something fresh and exciting in the genre. Black Bananas have proven that rock music can still evolve and surprise us, and I can't wait to hear what they come up with next.","Step 1: Both reviews discuss the band Black Bananas' album ""Electric Brick Wall"", and mention the frontwoman Jennifer Herrema's background with Royal Trux and RTX.

Say Hi to Your Mom,Ferocious Mopes,Rock,4.8,June 20 2005,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"All the glowing reviews you may (not) have read for Brooklyn-based Say Hi to Your Mom could well have been written by the one-man emo band's one man, Eric Elbogen. According to a Knight-Ridder article, Elbogen writes rock reviews under a pseudonym ""so he doesn't alienate labels he might want to partner with down the road"". Who knows, he might be writing these words right now. Or not: I took the L train to Bedford for the first time just Saturday night, but Elbogen already had a song about it and other yuppie-hipster touchstones on last year's Numbers & Mumbles. Home recordists today, unlike early-90s Sentridoh or even late-90s White Town, have enough technology at their fingertips to sound major, in that ""indie-rock""-is-the-new-""alternative"" kind of way. A certain careerism is sweeping even the once-artiest loft apartments. As a result, ""style is taking over,"" in the sardonic words of Say Hi's sonic forebear, Pedro the Lion's David Bazan, and songs are on the outs. Hence, Say Hi's arrangements happen to become less sugary (lo-carb craze?) and more darkly Arcade-Fire-anthemic on the outfit's third record, Ferocious Mopes-- especially on wistful, quiet-loud ""Dimensions and Verticals"" and ""The Twenty-Second Century"". How convenient. On a homemade PC, Elbogen assembles slow, statuesque, self-consciously ""indie"" rock with analog synthscapes, overlapping distorted guitars, lots of low-end, and Conorrifically quavering whispers. Lyrically, he makes two classic misapprehensions: quirkiness for originality, and sincerity for significance. So ""Poor Pete Is a Bit Self-Conscious"" tells the tale of a would-be vampire over a stomping arena beat, while ""Recurring Motifs in Historical Flirtings"" (yep, that's the title) rides the chilly-synths-are-rad-again trend to label ""let's just be friends"" ""the four worst words in our language"". Boo hoo hoo. Frustratingly, Elbogen would have genuine potential if he spent as much time on songwriting as on being fashionable. ""Yeah, I'm in Love With an Android"" is movingly odd, and the too-brief acoustic closer ""As Smart as Geek Is Chic Right Now"" stabs deeper than its look-at-me title to describe the misfortune of toys accidentally given brains. ""Let's Talk About Spaceships"", from Numbers & Mumbles, is an all-the-right-notes ballad of 21st-century insecurity that could please fans of either Grandaddy or, gulp, Jimmy Eat World. Which reminds me: ""Marc Hogan"" is really just Jim Adkins' pen name.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7814-ferocious-mopes/,"Ryko,Euphobia",2005.0,"Hey there music lovers, today I am psyched to bring you a review of the rock music album ‘Ferocious Mopes’ by Say Hi to Your Mom. This album is quite an interesting piece of work, marked by its distinct sound and incredible creativity. Say Hi to Your Mom is a band that has been around since the early 2000s and comprises of lead musician Eric Elbogen. Elbogen's band has had quite the unique journey, moving from indie to more mainstream in the early 2000s. Their music has always been known to be innovative and not restricted to any genre, and they have brought their A-game to this album.

The name of the album 'Ferocious Mopes' alone tells us that we might be in for a crazy ride. The album is a mix of rock, electronic, and theatrical sounds that come together perfectly, defying any typical music stereotypes. The band's creative journey is evident in the myriad of sounds that they have incorporated in this album, including electronic guitar riffs, unique percussion instruments and even synthesized sounds. The bursts of sounds and memorable lyrics feel like an ode to broken hearts, ending relationships, and finding the strength to overcome them.

Personally, I was blown away by the way the band managed to create music that deals with heavy subject matter, but still is enjoyable to listen to. The lyrics within the songs tackle difficult emotions such as heartbreak and depression, but the sounds are uplifting and energizing. It's amazing how Say Hi to Your Mom managed to balance these contrasts and create something not only artistically unique, but also emotionally impactful. 

Overall, 'Ferocious Mopes' is a fantastic listen, especially for someone who craves rock music that doesn't quite fit the mold. The album is indeed not for everyone, especially people who enjoy a more polished and easy-to-digest sound. But for those willing to explore outside the familiar boundaries, ‘Ferocious Mopes’ is an excellent choice.

Biosphere,Autour de la Lune,Experimental,7.8,July 7 2004,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Biosphere's Geir Jenssen knows from cold. Residing as he does near the Arctic Circle in Norway, Jenssen understands the psychological implications of a sun that, like a lamented deadbeat parent, routinely disappears for months at a time, and the absence of that essential lifeforce takes an inevitable emotional toll that informs Jenssen's art. It's tempting to say that Biosphere's bleak music sounds as it does for the same reason countries of Norway's approximate latitude make the world's best Vodka. But then Jenssen's other great passion is mountaineering (he has climbed the 26,906 foot Himalayan peak Cho Oyu without oxygen), suggesting a kernel of inspired humanity frozen in the tundra. The vacuum of space gets pretty close to absolute zero, cold's recognized ideal, so it makes sense that the conceptually minded Jenssen sets albums there. His latest trip into the beyond started when French radio commissioned Jenssen to create a piece using their archives. He selected sounds from a radio dramatization of Jules Verne's space travel story De la Terre à la Lune (""From the Earth to the Moon"") and pulled additional material from recordings made at the MIR space station, then combined the fragments with his own new music. The result is Autour de la Lune, a single 74-minute piece in nine movements. The samples are used sparingly throughout Autour de la Lune, and the beat-driven side of Biosphere is completely absent. Mostly, the record is a showcase for long and impossibly deep drones. The 21-minute opener ""Translation"" is an exception here, as a cluster of midrange notes that braid to form a definite melody. Rather than referencing found sound or environmental recordings, ""Translation"" seems inspired by film music, with tense throbs and horn-like synth lines that suggest captured images of a spacecraft leisurely moving in front of stars. The scene is set. The following ""Rotation"" does away with the fanfare to send faint pings and bass swells into the blackness, but the exceptional ""Modifié"" is where the record starts to get creepy. Jenssen processes human voices-- hard to tell if they're from the radio broadcast or MIR cosmonauts-- in a way that merges them completely with the electrical noise that carries them. They sound lost and unreachable, the last little whimpers of a doomed crew about to be swallowed by the event horizon. And yet, they're singing, kind of. We follow them into darkness with the next few tracks, which consist of little more than the most punishing bass tones I've ever heard on a CD. On ""Déviation"", sounds hover at the bottom end of human audibility, causing all but the heartiest subwoofers to sound like an open newspaper flapping in a strong wind. I've approached this bass from three different sources (two sets of headphones and my living room speakers), and I can only guess the genuine sound through triangulation. Strange things happen when I listen to ""Circulaire"" loud on headphones; the low end is total and all encompassing, but with the kind of throb that happens when you can hear your heart beating in your ears. The contrast means that the ambient sounds wherever I happen to be create ""notes"" in between the pulses. Because it seems so grounded in biology, I can't help but imagine this middle section as a musical approximation of the ambience in a suit during a spacewalk, where you hear nothing but your own body. If that's so, ""Tombant"" is accompaniment to the final drift back into the docking hatch, as it reprises the textures and symphonic swell of the opening ""Translation"". Autour de la Lune is an excellent record that is nearly victimized by its awesome conceptual success. It offers such a compelling and internally complete idea of interstellar space-- moods, textures, samples, cover art, all of it-- that it loses some flexibility when it comes to individual interpretation. Still, Jenssen gotten exactly where he wanted to go. Upon reaching the icy mountain peak, he kept climbing into the stars.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/710-autour-de-la-lune/,Touch,2004.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, behold! The experimental soundscape of Biosphere's ""Autour de la Lune"" has landed. If you're looking for a musical odyssey, then you've arrived at your destination. From the moment you press play, prepare to be transported to another dimension.

Biosphere has been creating ambient music for over 25 years and has become synonymous with the genre. This album was released in 2004, and it's apparent that the band had spent a great deal of time crafting these sounds. The album's name ""Autour de la Lune"" translates to ""Around the Moon"" which is fitting given how otherworldly the listening experience is. The album has been rated 7.8 out of 10, and I completely understand why.

What strikes me most about this album is how the soundscapes are created. It's all-encompassing, with a myriad of textures and tones that seep into your consciousness. The tracks ""Birds Fly by Flapping Their Wings"" and ""Altostratus"" are perfect examples of this. From the sound of wind whistling through trees to the delicate plucking of strings, each sound feels deliberate and carefully placed. There is no rush, and each track is allowed to breathe and stretch. 

One of my personal highlights is the track ""Le Grand Dome."" Its execution is somewhat playful, with robotic sounds emerging from the chaos. The sound of laughter and clapping can also be heard, adding a layer of humanity to an otherwise inhuman sound. It's both mesmerizing and jarring.

Various Artists,A House Full of Friends,,7.1,March 14 2005,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"Magic Marker is a U.S. label specializing in divisive collegiate indie pop. After all, in post-emo America, it takes a certain sort of music geek to get into the irony-free cuddlecore of, say, the Softies, whose live ""It's Love"" caps this two-disc set. Let's face it, though: Either you're with the Lucksmiths, or you're with the terrorists. That aesthetic in mind, A House Full of Friends compiles the highlights of 34 house parties you probably didn't attend unless you were living in Portland, Ore., between 1997 and 2004. The story goes: Faced with dwindling all-ages options and a prohibitively costly bar scene, Magic Marker co-founders Mark Rothkopf and Curt Kentner invited their favorite bands to play in their home. Those bands, in turn, lend their recordings to this retrospective of twee times at 4306 SE 34th Ave. A House Full of Friends is best received as an introduction to recent indie pop from the Pacific Northwest and beyond. The Shins, the compilation's biggest name, are represented here with a slinky, worthwhile cover of T. Rex's ""Baby Boomerang"" from last year's Fighting in a Sack EP, while the Lucksmiths turn in a characteristically chipper tune about a drowning relationship, the previously unreleased ""Once Again"". The Decemberists' still-vivid Victorian vision on 2003's ""The Chimbley Sweep"" may be familiar to most listeners, but Ashley Park's pleasantly Band on the Run-tinged ""Chelsea Beautiful"" probably isn't. Magic Marker's own Dear Nora, All Girl Summer Fun Band, Lunchbox, and Tullycraft also make strong appearances, but labelmates the Owls, whose ""Air"" should have been among last year's most-blogged mp3s, are regrettably absent. And tucked away as the second disc's penultimate song, the Salteens offer a brassy pop nugget, ""Time You Have Been Wasting"". The rest of the tracks are the stuff of a Twee.net listserv wish list: famous-if-you've-heard-of-'em bands like Aislers Set, #Poundsign#, Dressy Bessy, and Mates of State. The collection isn't without its clunkers, such Andrew Kaffer's glitchy title track. Still, indie pop fans will find the disc's lesser-known discoveries deserving of their time, and the accompanying 24-page photo booklet almost succeeds in making me wish I lived in a town where it rains all the time. All told, a very, very fine house.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2067-a-house-full-of-friends/,Magic Marker,2005.0,"If you're looking for a music album that's brimming with musical talent and a sense of community, look no further than A House Full of Friends. This album is a beautiful blend of different styles and sounds, all coming together to create a cohesive and wonderful listening experience.

Various Artists, as their name suggests, is a collaborative effort of different musicians who have come together to create something greater than themselves. These individuals have all enjoyed successful music careers in their own right, and now, they're putting their heads together to bring us some outstanding music.

The creation story of this album is just as impressive as its roster of musicians. The artists featured on A House Full of Friends all came together for a series of impromptu jam sessions, and the songs that came out of these sessions were so fantastic that they decided to record them and put them on an album. It's this sense of spontaneity and raw energy that gives the music on this album a unique edge.

As for the music itself, A House Full of Friends delivers in spades. The genre of nan may not be familiar to many, but it's one that's worth exploring. This genre encompasses a wide range of sounds, from ambient to experimental to electronic, and this album manages to blend all of these styles together in a way that feels effortless.

The standout tracks on this album are many, but a few that really stick out include ""The Dreamer's Lament,"" ""Neon Nightlife,"" and ""Echoes in the Machine."" These songs showcase the different strengths of the collaborators on this album, and they all come together to create something truly special.

Now, let's get personal. As someone who's always on the hunt for new and exciting music, A House Full of Friends was a pleasant surprise. The seamless collaboration between different artists never feels forced, and instead, it feels like a group of old friends coming together to create something beautiful.

Mr. Lif,I Heard It Today,Rap,5.3,April 16 2009,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"If Kanye West came into the game as ""the first with a Benz and a backpack,"" then Mr. Lif was surely ""the first with dreadlocks and Harry Potter glasses."" The thoughtful, earnest, and unapologetically cerebral Bostonian might be a prototypical ""rapper that liberal arts kids like,"" but he's also ferociously on-point and prodigiously skilled. His last full-length, Mo'Mega, winningly mixed warnings about government conspiracies and mind control with disarming odes to his unborn children and truly unexpected feminine-hygiene advice. On new album I Heard It Today, he takes this autobiographical tack a step further, fashioning each song as a sort of unfiltered blog-entry reaction to the news as it happens. He wrote, recorded, and released to blogs the songs on the record over the course of fall 2008, as the economy plummeted, election fever set in, and Barack Obama won the Presidency. Lif's intentions-- to heat up his politics with personal immediacy-- are admirable, but the result, unfortunately, recreates a bit too successfully how it might feel to read a Mr. Lif Huffington Post column. The successes and failures divide pretty evenly into songs that benefit from the sense they were spilled out in one long breath and ones that feel like they were written on a napkin minutes before recording. ""Welcome to the World"" and ""What About Us?"" were penned, as Lif tells us in the liner notes, as responses to the collapse of the world economy and the bailout plan, respectively, and they are sincerely aggrieved, gut-level blasts that benefit from the surging beats (by some dude named, no joke, Batsauce) that nicely recreate the sort of muscular apocalypse-rap Lif was rhyming over on the Emergency Rations EP. Other songs fall prey to the Cornel West rap-album-as-seminar problem, where Lif get so worked up he sort of forgets he's supposed to be rapping: ""It hurts that even our most prestigious leaders cannot shun what these centuries of hatred have done"" or ""They were willing to give people with bad credit loans because they knew within a few years, we're out of our homes and they can buy up all the same properties"" might be salient points, but they don't exactly make for natural-sounding lines. Which brings us to the other problem: Lif's always had passion and verbal dexterity to burn, but his lyrics typically don't offer much that you can't gather from your first Propagandhi album or an Alan Moore graphic novel. It doesn't help that he still insists on saying things like ""We should use our mind power to collapse the walls."" He also remains touchingly convinced that his decision to wear dreadlocks is controversial in any way, shape, or form: ""While I'm walking down the street, I see it all the time/ People looking at me like my dreads are a crime/ They signify the fact that I refuse to conform/ And I rock 'em real thick, cuz I'm allergic to the norm."" His most thoughtful moment on I Heard It Today comes on ""Head High"", where his indignation cools a bit and and he gets reflective: ""It hurts me to the marrow when I drive through the ghetto/ And see my peoples caught up in a life that won't let go/ And what's weird is/Few of them will hear this/ Melody I'm pouring from my heart so fearless."" It's moments like these that make Lif so appealing: he might be touring the Seven Sisters college circuit for the rest of his career, but he embraces his turf wholeheartedly and raps with palpable zeal and conviction. Unfortunately, the ratio of thoughtful zeal to clunky screed this time around is decidedly not in his favor.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12930-i-heard-it-today/,Bloodbot Tactical Enterprises,2009.0,"Let me start off by saying that “I Heard It Today” by Mr. Lif is an album that demands attention. It’s not something you can just have on in the background while you’re doing something else. No, this is an album that requires your full attention. And trust me, it’s worth it.

Mr. Lif, also known as Jeffrey Haynes, is a rapper from Boston who has been on the scene for over two decades. He’s known for his politically charged lyrics and his willingness to speak out on controversial issues. “I Heard It Today” is no exception. It’s an album that tackles some heavy topics, such as social injustice, poverty, and government corruption.

But before we dive into the content of the album, let’s talk about its creation story. Mr. Lif had taken a brief hiatus from music after a health scare, but he knew he had to make a comeback. He enlisted the help of some talented producers, including Batsauce, Willie Evans Jr., and Edan, and set out to create an album that would make a statement.

And boy, does it make a statement. The album opener, “Welcome to the World,” sets the stage for what’s to come. Mr. Lif comes out swinging with lines like “It’s like we’re living in a lie, a Matrix-like joke, the sheep are all asleep, the people are broke.” From there, he dives into topics like police brutality (“Police Brutality”), government surveillance (“The Nothing”), and the struggles of everyday people (“Collapse the Walls”).

But what sets this album apart is Mr. Lif’s ability to balance heavy subject matter with catchy beats and memorable hooks. “I Heard It Today” is an album that’s meant to be listened to from start to finish. Each track flows seamlessly into the next, creating a cohesive listening experience.

As for my personal experience and opinions, I’ll admit that I don’t typically listen to rap music. But there’s something about Mr. Lif’s flow and lyrical prowess that drew me in. I found myself nodding along to the beats and hanging on every word. It’s clear that he’s passionate about the issues he’s addressing, and that passion is contagious.

Overall, I’d give “I Heard It Today” a solid 8 out of 10. It’s an album that challenges you to think and feel, and it does so with finesse. If you’re looking for something to bump in the car or at a party, this might not be the album for you. But if you’re willing to give it a chance, I promise you won’t be disappointed.","1.

Neko Case,"The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight...",Folk/Country,8.2,September 5 2013,Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,"It feels quaint to think of the days when people called Neko Case a country singer; she has spent the past decade moving towards a sound that makes genre descriptions seem as confining and anachronistic as corsets. Case got her start playing drums in Vancouver punk bands. Then at some point, thankfully, someone convinced her that she could sing. Even italicized, that word feels inadequate to describe the meteorological event that takes place when Neko Case opens her mouth. Case has a moonbeam for a voice: imposing in timbre, opalescent in tone, and always surprising in its sheer force. Case’s earliest records (the first two were billed as Neko Case & Her Boyfriends), were collections of country standards and spirited but generically twangy originals (representative title: ""Honky Tonk Hiccups""). But once she broke off on her own and started writing her own material, beginning with 2002’s bleakly stirring Blacklisted, two seemingly contradictory things happened. The first is that her music became increasingly more pop-oriented, owing in part to her collaborations with Canadian rockers the Sadies and a side gig as the resident siren in one of the best power-pop bands of the last decade, the New Pornographers. The other is that her music became darkly, magnificently weird. All of Case’s subsequent solo records have a surreal, untamed quality about them, thanks to her unusual taste in protagonists (tornados, female prisoners, man-eating tigers) and the idiosyncratic grit of her songwriting voice. ""If I puked up some sonnets,"" she sings in one of the most quotable verses of her endlessly quotable new album, ""Would you call me a miracle?"" It’s a fair question, coming from an uncompromising artist whose career has unfurled like a sprawling, unruly piece of free verse. After the release of her last record, 2009’s Middle Cyclone, though, Case weathered a rough patch. She lost her grandmother (with whom she was close), and then both of her parents (with whom she was not), and as a result-- something she’s begun to talk about in interviews for this record-- sunk into a depression. ""It was physically debilitating,"" she told The Guardian recently. ""You’re just in this murk. And you’re with other humans but you lose all your human skills and it’s just like you’re in this plastic bag and you can’t quite connect with people."" Case’s remarkable new album, The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You is an exorcism of this dark period of her life-- and also her most plainly autobiographical album yet. It is to Case’s discography what 2005's The Sunset Tree was to the Mountain Goats’: a seasoned songwriter known for evocative portraits of fictional characters finally turning that gimlet eye in on itself. The result is the most potent album of her career. The Worse Things Get is made of the same metal as Middle Cyclone, but fashioned into a much sharper object. The languid, mid-tempo ballads that occasionally made Cyclone sag have been replaced by songs that are shorter, tighter, and more cutting. Not a single one overstays its welcome, from the bracing, minimal self-help credo ""Afraid"" to the wistful ""Calling Cards"", a quietly devastating tale of long-suffering long-distance longing. ""We’ll all be together, even when we’re not together,"" Case's voice swells, finally landing on a bittersweet image that rings out long after the song fades: ""I’ve got calling cards from 20 years ago."" The evolution between these two records is most striking, though, when the tempo revs up. When it first came out, the punchy lead-off single ""Man"" sounded like a retread of Cyclone’s caustically poppy ""People Got A Lotta Nerve"" (""I’m a man, man, man/ Man, man, man-eater""), but within the context of the record (or even more obviously, if you play the two back to back) the earlier song can’t hold a candle to it-- ""Man"" is bottled lightning. M. Ward’s buzzsaw lead guitar rages like a feral creature in a too-small cage, which, Case’s seething, unbridled vocal point out, is exactly what it feels like to be imprisoned in the impossible expectations of femininity. ""I’m a man/ That's what you raised me to be,"" she taunts like a shit-talking prizefighter. ""Fat-fingered bullies were no match for me/ I still taste them in my teeth."" Case’s songs have long played fast and loose with gender roles and often star bold women (""We’ve got a lady pilot,"" she announced memorably on Blacklisted, ""Not afraid to die!""), but at the same time they reject simple, hollow for-my-ladies sloganeering in favor of more complicated truths. The “strong, independent woman” is a cliché that society often paints in black and white, but Case’s take on the subject is a portrait of innumerable grays. In a Neko Case song, freedom, strength and womanhood are all statements punctuated by question marks rather than exclamation points. But whenever The Worse Things Get risks getting too conceptual, a casual, mildly self-deprecating humor always brings these songs back down to earth. ""I was surprised when you called me a lady,"" she sings on ""I’m From No Where"", a subdued, acoustic comedown following ""Man"", ""'Cause I’m still not so sure that’s what I wanna be."" It might sound like a grand, abstract statement, but her logic's totally reasonable: ""I remember the 80s/ And I remember its puffy sleeves."" It’s an emotionally wrenching record throughout, but The Worse Things Get is at its most devastating when it takes up motherhood. Animated by rattling percussion and an arrangement that chatters like a dense forest, the opener ""Wild Creatures"" has an intrepid air about it (""I’m not fighting for your freedom/ I am fighting to be wild"") until it ends on a minor-key revelation: ""There’s no mother’s hands to quiet me."" This particular absence hovers constantly in the ether of The Worse Things Get, until it finally bubbles over on the stunning a capella centerpiece ""Nearly Midnight, Honolulu"". It’s a bold move and perhaps the most polarizing song she’s ever released; Case usually dresses her subjects up in magical realism and poetic turns of phrase, but she’s never worn her heart on her sleeve as plainly as she does here. The song tells the story of a mother Case saw screaming at a child in an airport in Hawaii-- ""Get the fuck away from me!/ Why don’t you ever shut up?""-- and as she sings them she slathers the mother’s words in reverb, the echo poignantly suggesting ripple effects they’ll have on the kid’s psyche. ""Honolulu"" hits like a shot to the gut. Case writes the song as an open letter to the neglected child (""Don’t you ever shut up, kid/ Please have your say"") and amidst the arrangement’s negative space, her voice is a thick blanket in the shivering cold. And that’s the most impressive thing about The Worse Things Get: though it’s a record that looks at topics like depression and parental neglect square in the teeth, its overall tone is one of resilience. The penultimate track, ""Where Did I Leave That Fire"" begins with a sparse, post-rock arrangement but eventually gathers into a triumphant and surprisingly comic midtempo ballad about mojo returned. But the true victory lap is ""Ragtime"", a rousing blast of ""Crimson and Clover""-esque pop that serves up hard-won hope and plenty of mantras for carrying on. ""I’ll reveal myself invincible soon,"" Case sings, as a parade’s worth of brass swells around her in agreement. Somehow, The Worse Things Get is Case’s tightest record and also her strangest. With its off-kilter arrangements and eccentric turns of phrase, it’s a world unto itself. If it has any contemporaries, they’re records like Fiona Apple’s The Idler Wheel… or Cat Power’s Sun-- the works of artists for whom “maturity” has not meant putting out that fire that Case sings so evocatively about chasing.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18451-neko-case-the-worse-things-get-the-harder-i-fight/,Anti-,2013.0,"Neko Case's ""The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight..."" is an album that immediately captures the listener's attention with its raw and sincere sound. This record truly defines the essence of modern exploration of folk/country genre. At a rating of 8.2 out of 10, it is not hard to see why this collection of songs has become a fan favorite.

Neko Case, a celebrated American singer-songwriter, has been making music for over two decades now. Her impeccable voice and unique style of writing have made her one of the most respected musicians in the industry. ""The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight..."" is a testament to her craft as a musician, and to her ongoing evolution as an artist.

The album was recorded in Tucson, Arizona, and produced by Tucker Martine, who has worked with some of the biggest names in music. The songs on this album reflect Neko's personal experiences, struggles, and triumphs. One can sense the emotional connection that she has with each lyric and melody, and the passion she puts into every note she sings.

The album's opening track, ""Wild Creatures,"" sets the tone for the rest of the album. The upbeat melody and driving drums create a sense of urgency and adventure that draws the listener in. This energy is carried throughout the album, shifting in tone and tempo to create a range of emotions that are both powerful and poignant.

As I listen to this album, I am struck by Neko's honesty and vulnerability. The songs are filled with personal stories of love, loss, and growth. One song that particularly moved me was ""Nearly Midnight, Honolulu,"" a song about a child being verbally abused by their mother in a hotel hallway. The heartbreaking story is told with such raw emotion that it is impossible not to be affected by it.

Neko Case's ""The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight..."" is without doubt one of the best albums of the year. With each song, Neko shows why she is such a respected artist. This album is a reflection of her personal growth and artistic evolution. It is an album that deserves to be listened to from start to finish, with an open heart and an open mind.","1.

Hailu Mergia,Hailu Mergia and His Classical Instrument,Global,7.4,June 28 2013,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"In 1977, Walias Band recorded a darkly bobbing funk instrumental with an ominous horn theme called “Muziqawi Silt”. It was a couple years after the overthrow of Haile Selassie by Mengistu Haile Mariam, and Mengistu’s Derg government had applied the brakes to Addis Ababa’s nightlife, making it much harder for a working band to make a living. Music was still being made in abundance, though, and cassettes ultimately made it a lot easier to duplicate and distribute it. “Muziqawi Silt” surfaced in collector circles in the U.S. and Europe in the 90s and was canonized by a 2003 Ethiopiques volume, and it’s since become one of the tiny handful of songs that non-Ethiopians use as a gateway into the country’s music. Antibalas even covered it. Hailu Mergia was the keyboardist for Walias Band. His organ playing is one of the only things a lot of people know about Ethiopian music. Walias Band was more important than just that one track, though. When the band arrived on the scene, the typical arrangement was for the venue-- usually a hotel-- to provide a band with instruments. Walias broke that mold by buying their own and working out contracts with the venues they played. In the early 80s, during a tour of the United States, Mergia and a few other members decided not to return home. That was the end of the band, but they’d made their mark back home. A few years after moving to the U.S., Mergia decided to record an album that merged the sounds of his youth with modern technology. Working alone, he assembled a drum machine, a Rhodes piano, a Yamaha DX7, and his accordion, and got to work arranging old Ethiopian songs for this mostly modern palette. The results are striking and unusual. If Cluster had been from Ethiopia instead of Germany, this is probably about what they would have sounded like. Mergia uses the Yamaha to make his buzzy bass lines, fills in chords and texture with the Rhodes, and then solos over the top, alternately on the accordion or the Yamaha DX7, in an inimitably Ethiopian style. The sound is spare and unaffected, the drum programming never deviating during any song, though he sometimes augments the rhythmic push with vocals halfway between beatboxing and chanting. In addition to the fluttering modal melodies, there are other distinctly Ethiopian signatures running through the music, particularly in the triple meters and three-against-four rhythms of the songs. “Belew Beduby” stomps along on a swaying polyrhythm on a par with anything you’ll hear from early 70s Addis, while “Hebo Lale” modifies that beat a bit for more of a boogie feel, aided by a faster tempo. At the other end of the spectrum, “Sewnetuwa” drifts along on an almost eight-bit-sounding bass line, with Yamaha DX7 and accordion dueling on top. The overall effect of the album is difficult to describe. The music is simple and straightforward, accomplished but not showy. It feels at once rural, nostalgic, and futuristic. Replace the drum machine with people clapping, and you’d be a hair’s breadth from an ethnographic recording. Drum machines and synthesizers are common ingredients of Ethiopian pop music today, but not in the same way they’re used here. Perhaps one of the things that sets this apart from other Ethiopian pop music is the fact that it was made in solitude, and specifically out of longing for a vanished past. It’s introverted in a way very little other music from the country is. It’s also not quite like anything else you’ve ever heard.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18162-hailu-mergia-hailu-mergia-and-his-classical-instrument/,"Awesome Tapes From Africa,Awesome Tapes From Africa",1985.0,"Hailu Mergia and His Classical Instrument: A Global Masterpiece

When it comes to Hailu Mergia and his classical instrument, categorization becomes a futile endeavor. Mixing jazz, funk, and traditional Ethiopian music, the album oozes a universal appeal that defies classification. The result? A magnificent journey through time and culture that is sure to leave an indelible mark on your soul.

To truly appreciate this album, one must first know the story of the band and its masterful leader, Hailu Mergia. Born in Ethiopia, Mergia has always been hailed as a prodigious musician, and his journey to creating this masterpiece was one fraught with struggles and triumphs. After moving to Washington D.C. in the 1980s, Mergia spent years driving taxis to make ends meet before returning to music, fueled by a fire deep within his soul.

The inspiration behind Hailu Mergia and His Classical Instrument is as captivating as the music itself. Recorded solo in Mergia's bedroom, the album's creation was an almost intimate process that allowed the maestro to express his musical genius without any constraints. He effortlessly combines the delightful rhythms and melodies of his homeland with the intricate harmonies of jazz and the hypnotic groove of funk, resulting in an uplifting celebration of the human experience that is truly unparalleled.

In terms of personal experience, listening to this album is akin to taking a spiritual journey across continents and cultures. The opening track, 'Tizita', sets the tone for the rest of the album, with its hauntingly beautiful melody and Mergia's delicate piano work. The eponymous 'Hailu' tumbles joyously through intricate rhythms and intricate musical phrases, while 'Shemonmuanaye' leaves you spellbound with its spellbindingly intricate percussion section.

Overall, Hailu Mergia and His Classical Instrument is a timeless masterpiece that transcends both geography and time. It reminds us that music is indeed a universal language that can connect us all, regardless of who we are or where we come from.

Dinner,Psychic Lovers,Pop/R&B,5.0,April 12 2016,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"A former member of Danish chamber-pop group Choir of Young Believers, singer/songwriter and producer Anders Rhedin splits his time between Copenhagen, Berlin, and Los Angeles—in the last of these locales, he found work as a professional songwriter for the likes of Kid Cudi and Josh Groban, though he has compared his commercial pop songwriting effort to ""black magic."" From 2012 to 2014, Rhedin released a handful of cassette- and vinyl-only EPs under the Dinner moniker, leading the generally fantastic indie-rock label Captured Tracks to sign him in 2014 and issue a compilation, Three EPs: 2012-2014. A tour with labelmate Mac DeMarco followed. It's less clear from this debut outing if Dinner has the tracks to match Rhedin's impressive trajectory. Three EPs was a relatively varied outing, as suits its cobbled-together origins, but it introduced Rhedin's darkly deadpan take on ’80s synth-pop like the Simple Minds or Psychedelic Furs, complete with an alternate-universe novelty hit: the queasily catchy ""Going Out,"" which sneaks a tale of a druggy night on the town into what could be mistaken for an awkward invitation to go on a date (""Do you feel like going out tonight?""). Three EPs also presented Rhedin's unique vocal style, primarily a goofy baritone that must be how Stephin Merritt sounds to people who don't like the Magnetic Fields. On Psychic Lovers, Rhedin still sings like a failed Muppet auditioner, and layers more studio gloss on the new-wave noir template of ""Going Out,"" but without any song as modestly pleasant. Rhedin has billed the album as ""like sexual Christian rock ... but without all the Christianity,"" and, frankly, being asked to go out with him worked better when it wasn't really a come-on. Here, he's a ""normal guy"" longing for something to ""Turn Me On."" He wants ""What You Got."" He'd love to spend one night with you, because ""in your smile's a nuclear bomb,"" and you, person whose hips have ""oscillations"" as you walk down the street, own ""The World"" (""Every world belongs to you,"" to be more precise). The neon-glowing production is all just so, but the enjoyment we're supposed to get out of this lyrical mix of the portentous and the trite, and that gawky vocal delivery, in a world where The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink soundtracks have already existed for decades, with proper singing and catchy hooks and everything, isn't clear. Psychic Lovers does try out a few different hues within its fairly limited palette, but they mainly just add to the confusion. Sentimental slow-dance candidate ""Kali, Take Me Home"" showcases a children's choir and has a title that evokes the powerful Hindu goddess of creation and destruction. ""A.F.Y."" explores dubwise vocal effects and clanging distortion. ""Holy Fuck!"" languidly addresses not the sex, but the ""sexless fighting spells,"" imploring, ""Leave behind the lies."" Closer to the ’60s art-pop mode that occasionally surfaced on Three EPs is ""Lie,"" with its Nico-like guitar strums and orchestral touches; there's a choral backing vocal here, too. ""Wake Up"" has a tropical-house flavor and describes, guess what, waking up in various locales ""with you."" Rhedin's approach here theoretically could work. As the Nico comparison suggests, unconventional voices can turn out to be the most enduring, and even within the niche that critic Liz Colville once described on Pitchfork as ""boys with perpetual colds who can kinda-sorta sing"" you can find overlooked nuggets from bands like Seattle's BOAT or Sweden's Suburban Kids With Biblical Names. As for the realm of so-fake-it's-real '80s sendup, Ariel Pink stands out for his eccentricity, while John Maus delivers chest-beating live performances and cerebral songcraft, which brings us to the stage-devouring neo-New Romanticism of justly revered band Future Islands. The subtle but crucial difference, as with anything else—including Christian sex without the Christianity—is in how you do it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21752-psychic-lovers/,Captured Tracks,2016.0,"If you're looking for a synth-heavy Pop/R&B album with a nostalgic 80s throwback vibe, then Psychic Lovers by Dinner is an album you should definitely get your ears on.

Firstly, let me give you some context. Dinner is a solo project created by Danish musician Anders Rhedin, who moved to L.A. to broaden his musical horizons. He’s known for his quirky lyrics, retro-electro sound, and satirical style. Psychic Lovers is his fourth album, which was recorded while he was living in Los Angeles. It’s a love letter to the city, its hallucinatory effects, and the strange relationships that form in its anonymity.

The album opens with ""Content Coma,"" a moody track that sets the tone for the entire record. It's dark, synthy, and a bit eerie. The beat is slow, but not dull, and the melody is captivating. It's the perfect intro track that sets you up for what's to come: a moody journey through the reality of life in L.A.

The following tracks, like ""Wake Up,"" ""Universe,"" and ""The World,"" are laid-back songs that bring a steady and hypnotic rhythm. The lyrics are simple, but effective; the arrangements are both smooth and complex. The combination of Dinner's vocals over the deep synths and varied percussion creates a contemplative and introspective vibe.

One of the standout tracks for me is ""Psychic Lovers,"" the title track of the album. It’s the perfect encapsulation of the album - it’s sophisticated, it’s offbeat, and it has just the right amount of weirdness. The playful melody is accompanied by introspective lyrics about the duality of reality that Rhedin cleverly presents with his charming sense of humor.

Even if the album’s sound is on the somber side, the final tracks do pick up the pace a bit. ""Turn Me On"" is a fun, uptempo track with lyrics that reflect Rhedin’s mischievous side. This upbeat shift brings a feeling of hopefulness that picks up the mood of the entire album.

Overall, Psychic Lovers is a moody but mesmerizing album that’s worth checking out. It’s an album that's both timeless and restricted to its own unique place in time. Rhedin’s musical craftsmanship is apparent in the detailed production of the tracks, which are complex without being excessive. It’s an album that is uniquely Dinner, a project that is expertly crafted and wonderfully weird.

While Psychic Lovers may not be for everyone, it’s definitely worth the listen for anyone who wants to experience something different from the usual suave and cliche pop tunes. However, I can understand why it only has a rating of 5 out of 10 - while the album’s mix of genres is compelling, Rhedin's approach to the music can feel a bit too scattered and detached for some listeners. But if you’re anything like me and enjoy going on a musical journey that leaves you feeling a little uneasy and a lot introspective, then Psychic Lovers by Dinner is definitely worth a listen.","1.

Anna Caragnano & Donato Dozzy,Sintetizzatrice,,7.2,April 8 2015,Andy Beta,Contributor,"One might be forgiven for anticipating that this collaboration between Italy’s ambient techno demiurge Donato Dozzy and Rome-based vocalist Anna Caragnano would be equal parts Dozzy and Caragnano, with his productions coursing beneath garlands of her voice. But Sintetizzatrice thrills in inverting such expectations. Imagine if Andy Stott’s Faith in Strangers drew upon only Alison Skidmore’s voice and you have an idea of what Dozzy and Caragnano are up to here. There’s not a throb, kick or ambient wash to be heard, no hardware to spot. Caragnano’s effervescent and honed voice is the only instrument at work, providing stratospheric highs and low end, with Dozzy deploying an array of strategies and processing to mirror, multiply, and fracture Caragnano’s flexible voice across these nine tracks. ""Introduzione"" begins with Caragnano surrounded by multitudes of herself, a solo performer on a subway car soon crammed with chattering commuters jostling for space. While it sets the stage for what will follow, it’s one of Sintetizzatrice’s least interesting moments. But once Caragnano’s utterance ""rain"" on ""Starcloud"" begins to sound through the space, soon surrounded with innumerable echoes of herself, we enter two-and-a-half minutes of rarefied space, Caragnano’s every hum and sigh transmogrified into a heavenly body. Dozzy finds myriad ways to recast Caragnano. ""Luci"" brings to mind the likes of Grouper, Julia Holter and Julianna Barwick. Dozzy takes the gossamer thread of a single breath at the start of ""Fraledune"", loops it until it becomes as expansive as a choir and then once that mass of sound is built, teases an even high sonority out of it. He moves Caragnano to the other end of the register for ""Parallelo"", favoring deep resonant tones, as if she is sounding from the bottom of a well. Another small mouth sound is used to approximate a thump on ""Parola"", which leads into the traditional Italian folk of ""Festa (A Mottola)"". Myself, I prefer Caragnano when she’s less tangible and earthly, more cloudy and ineffable, as she is uttering ""love without sound."" About the only complaint to level at Sintetizzatrice is its brevity. The body-erasing moments collected here don't even break the half-hour mark, which is a shame, because the sound of Caragnano’s brief sighs stretched towards infinity is a wonderful sound in which to luxuriate.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20387-sintetizzatrice/,Spectrum Spools,2015.0,"If you're looking for a unique and innovative listening experience, look no further than Anna Caragnano and Donato Dozzy's ""Sintetizzatrice"" album. This album is a must-listen for fans of the nan genre, as it offers a refreshing take on the electronic music world.

Let's start by talking about the band's history. Anna Caragnano is a classically trained singer hailing from Naples, Italy. Her ethereal and haunting voice can be heard throughout the album, lending an otherworldly quality to the already unconventional tracks. Donato Dozzy, on the other hand, is an accomplished DJ and producer known for his experimental takes on techno and electronic music. Together, they form a dynamic duo that pushes the boundaries of what electronic music can be.

Now, let's dive into the album's creation story. ""Sintetizzatrice"" was recorded at the legendary Studio Napoli, and the space seems to have played a significant role in the final sound. The album melds together organic and synthetic elements seamlessly; at times, it's difficult to tell which is which. The result is a sound that's both futuristic and nostalgic, with each track offering up something new to discover.

My personal favorite track on the album is ""Introduzione."" The sustained notes of the synthesizer create an ominous feeling that builds and builds until Caragnano's vocals cut through like a beam of light. It's a perfect opener to an album that never quite lets you find your footing. From there, the tempo shifts and the soundscapes grow more complex, with tracks like ""Parallelo"" and ""Festa (A Midsummer Night's Groove)"" offering up something entirely different.

The album's rating of 7.2 out of 10 feels a little harsh to me. Yes, this isn't your typical electronic music album, but that's precisely what makes it special. Caragnano and Dozzy have created something that's truly unique, and it's worth taking the time to explore. If you're a fan of electronica, I highly recommend giving ""Sintetizzatrice"" a listen. You won't be disappointed.","1. Review A uses more sophisticated language and sentence structure, with more advanced vocabulary, metaphors and similes than Review B.

The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die,"Whenever, If Ever",Rock,7.8,August 21 2013,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"By the time you've finished reading the name ""The World is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die,"" you've likely made two assumptions about this band and both are warranted-- yes, they identify as ""emo"" and yes, they have little to no use for restraint and understatement. Though on a much, much smaller scale, TWIABP resemble Arcade Fire prior to Funeral, having made their name on a promising EP and unpredictable, cathartic live performances that feature nearly a dozen people making music at the same time. But the greater similarity lies in Whenever, If Ever being a rare debut that’s powered by an almost frightening will to live, a desperation that strongly suggests the people involved have no other option to deal with what's inside of them-- when Thomas Diaz screams “let's hope that this works out/ this has got to work out!"" during the frantic conclusion of “Fightboat”, you realize “this” means everything. TWIABP have already become a bit of a cause célèbre as emo reemerges as a viable, visible genre of independent rock rather than just a pejorative adjective. Understandable, even if there wasn’t anything like them the first time around-- for one thing, they’re from Connecticut and roll about 10 deep, switching vocalists on the fly and utilizing strings and horns to create textures that are more based in post-rock or mid-00s indie rock. And at the risk of revisionist history, I’m just going to put this out there: Cap’n Jazz, Jazz June, and all that other jazz was never this melodic, never this instrumentally tight, and never this well-produced. But if that sound meant everything to you at some point or if you’ve been waiting for a comeback for the sole purpose of airing out old grievances, Whenever, If Ever suits your needs. They have a weakness for the emo trope of singing being the truest form of self-expression, an act even purer if you don’t have any kind of studied vocal capability-- ""we sang songs/ but we never learned your words or melodies"", ""and when our voices fail us/ we will find new ways to sing,"" things like that. And on first proper track “Heartbeat in the Brain”, TWIABP sounds like the kind of band where you get the lead vocals simply by wanting it more-- there’s the adenoidal guy, the screaming guy, someone named ""Shitty Greg"" who might not be either of them, and they sometimes sing in tandem, initially exaggerating their hiccuping modulations to a degree that feels like trolling; you’ll know pretty quickly if you’re built for this stuff if “Kinsella” is your safe word. There are the musical cues as well-- searching arpeggios over palm-muted clean chords, spastic drum fills, nasal Casio synth leads. Hell, “Fightboat” might even cause squabbling amongst the old heads as its introductory horn line recalls the one from American Football’s “The Summer Ends”, which some people still complain about to this day. It takes a little while for Whenever, If Ever to get going, but once it does, TWIABP establish they are not an emo revival act, but more of a spiritual descendent of Danielson Famile or an early 00s Saddle Creek band, a community whose albums serve as a time capsule, a documentation of their lives. It’s unclear exactly when that click happens, but it’s definitely during “Picture of a Tree That Doesn't Look Okay”. Perhaps it’s the part where Greg Horbal asks over desiccated, detuned guitars, “Do you think the landlord’s pissed?/ We left a car parked on the lawn again”-- it’s an inside joke that doubles as a conspiratorial invitation, indicating that you’re welcome to join in and, hell, maybe you were there the whole time (the car ends up on the lawn again by the very next song). Or it could be the point where Whenever, If Ever starts to incorporate clever segues to establish a chronology and continuity to the story-- a delayed guitar resembles a bong rip as “Picture” drifts into “You Will Never Go to Space” and the final line of that song (""Did we dream when we were skeletons/ or did we just wish for our skin?"") becomes foreshadowing for “The Layers of Skin We Drag Around”. Or, maybe it’s after the pace picks up and TWIABP shake off the slowcore rust, a drum roll crescendo leading into a rousing call and response coda where the hooks work out their kinks and become singalongs. Either way, once “Picture” passes, TWIABP already have accrued the confidence and wisdom to do things they seemed incapable of only minutes prior. “Ultimate Steve” distills the band’s post-rock and emo extremes into concentrate, an all-together-now, 30-second shoutalong bookended by a gorgeous build and fade. During the revolutionary final third, the stakes and consequences of this life pursuit start to push back on TWIABP. “Gig Life” bears the record’s most instantly memorable melody and lyrics, an acoustic power ballad that would’ve been intolerable if performed with the same abandon from earlier. Diaz sings, “You ran away/ You were afraid to make mistakes/ but that's the biggest one you made."" It’s unclear to whom it’s pointed (a former bandmate? A high school friend? An ex?) or where ""somewhere to the west, I suppose"" even entails, it could be New York City or the next town over for all we know. But “Gig Life” establishes that TWIABP understand the sacrifices and the rewards of their chosen gig life and are saddened at losing this person, that it might be a personal failure on their behalf. Still, being stuck in West Virginia with the same old Rival Schools albums and food from the nearest Sheetz are their occupational hazards; those of your “gig” might entail water cooler talk and the occasional bagel, but it's still a gig. Are you satisfied? “Low Light Assembly” follows as a solemn, final hymn (""the parking lot where we lay is more than home now"") before the stunning closer “Getting Sodas."" A brooding, minor key bassline gives you pause to realize just how far TWIABP have come in barely a half hour-- they’ve established a community, this one’s for an audience. And it’s big room stuff: the guitars peal and ring rather than hang and drone, the low end is heavier and reverbed, the screaming sounds aimed rather than scattershot. And it closes on a chorale that the band created itself to express: ""The world is a beautiful place/ but we have to make it that way... and if you're afraid to die/ Then so am I."" Yeah, it sounds like Arcade Fire and it sounds like Bright Eyes too, but the intent of those words is more crucial. It reminds me of Win Butler promising to build tunnels as the world collapses around him and his lover, Conor Oberst demanding the tape roll so that he and his friends can document their love for each other. It’s a spirit available to everyone and possessed by no one, yet so few bands choose to pursue it even as those that do tend to be rewarded-- it’s a realization that you can be ambitious and striving with kindness, pushing against a palpable resistance without turning existence into an ""us vs. them"" zero sum game. Whenever, If Ever fights against fears, societal expectations, preconceptions, and the metaphysical for the greater good of society, and I mean, for crying out loud, the cover just says jump right in and do it. And sure, TWIABP make mistakes on Whenever, If Ever because they’re scared of not doing so, but it’s flawed in a way that can make a listener feel like it’s theirs, something that might inspire them to make a more perfect version of it. Whenever, If Ever probably won't ever be Funeral or Lifted or Ships or Diary on a mass level, but you know TWIABP feel like it’s their best shot at it and don’t care whether a dozen or several thousand people end up feeling the same.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18423-the-world-is-a-beautiful-place-i-am-no-longer-afra-whenever-if-ever/,Top Shelf,2013.0,"Hey there, fellow music enthusiasts! Today, I want to share my thoughts on the album ""Whenever, If Ever"" by The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die. This album is an impressive display of the band's raw talent, including aggressive guitar riffs, emotionally driven lyrics, and soaring vocal harmonies. The album is categorized in the rock genre, and I would rate it a 7.8 out of 10.

For those who may not know, The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die is an American indie-rock band hailing from Connecticut. They formed in 2009 with a rotating cast of musicians, which makes them unique because their sound changes from project to project. In this album, the band shows a masterful blend of post-rock and emo. They successfully develop an atmosphere that is both intense and introspective.

What I adore most about this album are the intricate rhythms and dual-guitar tracks. The songs are melting pots of musical ideas, with melodies and themes intertwining to create a cohesive listening experience. For instance, the song ""Heartbeat in the Brain"" starts with a restrained guitar riff that builds into a massive wall of distorted sound. The song eventually breaks down to an acoustic guitar and voice before erupting into a triumphant climax. This type of composition is present throughout the whole album and helps create an overall ambiance.

The album was entirely self-produced by the band, which is an incredible feat. The production quality is excellent, and each instrument is mixed perfectly. Despite the musicianship and excellent songwriting, the album is not just a technical showcase. The lyrics are honest and heartfelt, and each song tells a personal story. The album title itself captures the mood, which deals with the feelings of wonder, fear, and loss of control.

As for personal experience, this album hit me on a deep emotional level. The messages and themes resonated with me as I went through my daily life, and the songs became the soundtrack to my life. For instance, the song ""Picture of a Tree That Doesn’t Look Okay"" deals with the weight of living with mental illness. It goes beyond the diagnosis and speaks to the emotional turmoil that goes hand-in-hand with it, and as someone who has been living with anxiety, this song personally affected me.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend ""Whenever, If Ever"" to anyone who loves intricate songwriting and emotional, introspective music. The album has something for everyone and is well worth the listen. The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die has again shown that they are a gifted band that continually pushes the boundaries of their genre.","1.

Division Day,Beartrap Island,Rock,6.1,April 15 2008,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"As the recent yacht-rock revival has illustrated, the west coast has traditionally been associated with a certain sunshined contentment and peaceful easy feeling. However, the most prominent indie rock artists to have sprung from the region in the past decade have been defined by a notable lack of fun, fun, fun, from the macro, modern-world meditations of Grandaddy to the fraught, tender intimacies of Death Cab for Cutie. Situated between these two totems-- both geographically and spiritually-- are L.A.'s Division Day, who are seemingly so in tune with west-coast despondency that they named themselves after an Elliott Smith song. But Division Day are rarely shy about their diffidence-- their debut full-length, Beartrap Island, communicates its overarching sense of melancholy with assertive, sometimes aggressive gestures. The album has been gestating since 2005, and though one can't assume the tracklist reflects the songwriting's chronology, Beartrap Island plays like a spirited juxtaposition of ideas before tempering itself into a more refined, if less captivating, presentation. In its opening stretch, the album touches on wondrous, synth-swathed psychedelic reveries (the 80-second title track), scrappy, staccato rock rave-ups (""Ricky"") and, in their most successful turn, a reconciliation of the two on ""Catch Your Death"", which locks into a swirling, stuttering drum beat (suggesting a nascent dub influence) before double-timing into an effectively urgent chorus. But with the onset of ""Hurricane"", Division Day's agenda comes into sharper focus: plaintive, pulse-regulating adult-contemporary indie rock that's often afflicted with a bout of mid-tempo-itis. Perhaps sensing that his bald sentiments (to wit: ""I want your blood inside my head"") could set off the emo alarm, singer Rohner Segnitz maintains a poised, breathy delivery that keeps the melodrama and histrionics to a minimum, but at the same time seems overly subservient to the songs' lazy haze; by the time we hit the second-act power ballad ""Reversible"", the portentous synth tones and Edge-y guitars render Division Day indistinguishable from any number of contemporary modern-rock bands striving for 1980s Big Music import. So it's no small consolation that Beartrap Island's most serious song topic is given an affectingly spare presentation that allows Segnitz's voice to stand on its own humble terms, without attempting to obscure or bolster it. The song is called ""Dayenu"", a reference to a Passover hymn commemorating the Exodus tale, wherein the title (which translates to ""it would suffice us"") is traditionally sung with joyous gusto. But in Division Day's case, the song's theme-- essentially, one of just being lucky to be alive-- is appropriated for a downcast rumination on surviving a near-fatal fever, illuminated by trolling organ accompaniment and sparks of feedback. Perhaps it's not the most appropriate selection for the Seder table this weekend, but in their own modest way, Division Day turn their own sorrow into something worth celebrating.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11402-beartrap-island/,Eenie Meenie,2007.0,"Beartrap Island by Division Day is a rock album with a 6.1 out of 10 rating that deserves every point. As an avid music lover, I was thoroughly impressed by the ingenuity of the band and the creativity they displayed in crafting this album.

Division Day is an exceptional band that has been consistently churning out quality music for years. Founding member and solo songwriter Ryan Wilson is a visionary talent with a great ear for melodies, rhythms, and song structure. Wilson along with the band members, Jose Diaz and Rohner Segnitz, seem to understand that rock music can go far beyond the conventions and provided an album that continuously delivers on this notion.

Beartrap Island is an album that pulls listeners into the band's story with a fusion of melancholy and upbeat elements. The album plays with various themes, including alienation, regret, love, and more. The result is a sound that is both engaging and intimate, with soulful lyrics that resonate on every track.

What I found interesting was the unique way that the album was constructed. Initially, the album was written in its entirety by Wilson, who worked in isolation in a cabin with no electricity or running water. The setting of the cabin added depth to the album, and this can be seen in the organic sound and realness that the album carries. It's easy to imagine Wilson scribbling away, wood-cracking in the background, an old typewriter as his only lighting source, churning out those melodious lyrics that captured the essence of his surroundings.

The album opens up with the title track ""Beartrap Island,"" a beautiful piece that tells the story of a man trying to reach a destination, taking risks and making sacrifices only to realize that his life's purpose was not on that trip. ""Azalean,"" the second track, introduces us to the band's psychedelic side, a catchy beat that takes over the listener's body and soul.

""Ricky,"" a more upbeat track and my personal favorite, is where the album hits its stride – sets the scene for a late summer drive. The song is a lyrical theater, depicting a relationship on the verge of collapse by painting a vivid image with the guitar riffs, and the basslines driving a narrative that speaks volumes. It's easily relatable, for anyone who has been heartbroken and had to pick up the remnants piece by piece.

As I listened to this album, I could not help but find myself lost in its magic. The band's ability to convey a range of emotions so effortlessly is remarkable, and it's this level of mastery that solidifies the band's place in the rock music industry.

In conclusion, Beartrap Island by Division Day is an engaging rock album that takes listeners on a soulful journey. With powerful lyrics, a unique sound, and brilliant delivery, this album is a must-listen.""","Step-by-step reasoning:

Unknown Mortal Orchestra,Sex & Food,Rock,7.0,April 9 2018,Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,"When he founded Unknown Mortal Orchestra in 2010, Ruban Nielson declared his intention to “hatch a new musical dimension,” using the language of psychedelia as a cover for old-fashioned solipsism. UMO’s insomniac psych-rock has an escapist quality, but it is the inward escape of burrowing so deeply into solitude that one’s own misery becomes abstract. In the half-ruins of Nielson’s songs, loneliness is so pervasive you forget it’s there. This commitment to interiority is part of his outsider charm, which stretches far beyond the Portland, Oregon basement where he often records. Just as Tame Impala use solitude to springboard into kaleidoscopic wonderlands, Nielson maps inward frustrations to make his home in the psychic gutter. That he remains morbidly internal on Sex & Food, UMO’s mildew-covered fourth record, is hardly surprising. On its predecessor, 2015’s Multi-Love, Nielson documented the true story of his and his wife’s entanglement with a shared third lover, somehow coming away with the breeziest music of his solo career. That record’s spiritual uplift was a relief—both in musical terms and as a window into Nielson’s psychiatric health, often grimly portrayed in his nihilistic lyrics. On some level, it’s a relief again to see Nielson discover new territory on Sex & Food. The record’s otherworldly folk, shellshocked R&B, and emaciated soul drift closer than ever to that “new musical dimension” of his. But it can be an exhausting trip. Where Multi-Love upped UMO’s mainstream- and sex-appeal, here we have a more radical reinvention—one that dials down both qualities to a freezing point. These minimal songs sound ready to give up the ghost altogether and sink back into the fabric of the universe. This was always a danger, that Nielson’s antique obsessions—his compression of rock history into pedals, fog-machine filters, and other vintage affects—would finally land him in a creative black hole. But the black hole, it turns out, sounds pretty good: bleak, austere, kind of creepy, but possessed of something admirably deranged, pinballing between love and indifference, bops and dirges, pop and its opposite. Hidden in this chilly world is an assortment of oddities: “How Many Zeros” projects Nielson’s falsetto onto ghostly funk, like Thundercat master tapes fished from a river, while “Hunnybee,” a love song to his young daughter, sleepwalks between disco and R&B with eerie calm. Even “Not in Love We’re Just High,” a gorgeous declaration of romantic incapacity, sounds washed-out and strangled, like a downbeat Prince rarity recorded on a dictaphone in Arthur Russell’s pocket. At times, you begin to feel like a prisoner in the “hostile wasteland” described in “Ministry of Alienation.” Full of oblique nods to modern disaffection—“No one will fuck the ugly robot,” Nielson wheezes—the psych-folk curio meanders inconclusively and ends with a miniature, mortally wounded sax solo. Much of Sex & Food sounds like work in progress, ideas toward a more inviting fusion of insular sounds and soulful alienation. If these are indeed building blocks, the completed music might sound something like “If You’re Going to Break Yourself,” weird-era Sly Stone feel and lyrics about friendships lost in a drug wilderness. While still rooted in Nielson’s desires and frustrations, this human moment hints at a UMO enriched by looking to the outside world once in a while. Sex & Food is best in this spaced-out zone, where alienation sounds genuinely alien. The record’s disembodiment is precisely what makes it intriguing and, occasionally, unlistenable. The songs often sound reluctant to be heard at all and have none of the lysergic flair that makes gear-driven rock music indulgent. Sex & Food goes the opposite way, draining away all empathy and worldly color until you are cocooned, for better or worse, in Ruban Nielson’s tiny, claustrophobic psyche.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/unknown-mortal-orchestra-sex-and-food/,Jagjaguwar,2018.0,"When it comes to the indie rock scene, few bands have made as much noise in recent years as Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Since their inception, UMO have been known for their unique sound, blending elements of rock, funk, and psychedelia into a captivating listening experience. And with their latest release, ""Sex & Food,"" the band once again delivers a sonic journey that is both thought-provoking and highly enjoyable.

One thing that stands out about this album is how effortlessly the band blends different styles and genres. Tracks like ""Ministry of Alienation"" and ""Major League Chemicals"" feature funky basslines and groovy guitar riffs that will make you want to dance, while songs like ""American Guilt"" and ""Hunnybee"" perfectly capture the melancholic and introspective tone of indie rock. And throughout the album, frontman Ruban Nielson's vocals are a highlight, as he effortlessly transitions from crooning to screaming with ease.

In terms of the album's creation story, Nielson has stated that he wrote much of the album while on tour, and you can hear the influence of different cultures and soundscapes throughout. For example, ""Not in Love We’re Just High"" has a breezy, tropical vibe that feels like a perfect soundtrack for a sunny day at the beach, while ""Everyone Acts Crazy Nowadays"" has an intro that sounds like it could have come from a classic Bollywood film.

Of course, as with any album, there are a few tracks that don't quite hit the mark. ""Chronos Feasts on His Children"" feels a bit repetitive, and ""The Internet of Love (That Way)"" is a little too cheesy for my tastes. But overall, ""Sex & Food"" is a highly enjoyable listening experience, with UMO showcasing their impressive range and musicianship throughout.

To sum it up, if you're looking for an album that will take you on a sonic journey full of surprises, look no further than Unknown Mortal Orchestra's ""Sex & Food.""

Quix*o*tic,Mortal Mirror,"Electronic,Pop/R&B,Rock",3.6,July 16 2002,Eric Carr,Contributor,"O, Canada, we need to sit down for some face time, just you and me. How's everything? How are all the trees? Good? Glad to hear it. How's the old national self-esteem doing? Only reason I ask is that I've been seeing all these ""Made in Canada"" stickers on things lately. This little plea for attention just seems kinda... desperate, you dig? Don't worry, man; we haven't forgotten about you. Do you feel like we've been neglecting you down here? Why, suddenly, is there this need to be all like, ""Hey! Remember Canada? We make things!"" It just worries me, that's all. You're like a washed up actor desperate for work, attaching your name to anything that crosses the border. Have you heard some of these CDs you've given your precious Canadian blessings to? Well, it happens that I've got one of the steaming piles that you've so lovingly manufactured right here. It's Mortal Mirror by Quixotic, and if it isn't a reason to reconsider pimping out your national pride on just anything, I don't know what is. I was kind of worried from the get-go-- I don't need to tell you that the all-girls-plus-testosterone-infused-drummer thing is rapidly flirting with becoming another indie-rock clichÃ©. But at least Mick Barr plays bass instead of drums, and Christina and Mira Billotte are sisters, so it's kind of a wash. The album art, a photo by Barbara Billotte, immediately made me wonder just when it was that Kill Rock Stars began signing Goth acts, but, ever conscientious and objective, I simply recalled that no matter how famous Richard Meltzer might be, you can't judge an album solely by its cover art. O, Canada, if only my fears had been dispelled. I was hoping my concerns were unfounded, but it was downhill from the moment I spun the disc. You should have nipped this in the bud, Canada-- I didn't know what I was in for. ""Ice Cream Sundae"" plodded lifelessly at me, nothing but irritatingly repetitive bass and off-key, apathetic vocals. It was stark, minimal, and frightfully unpleasant, and even though it was punctuated with a playful guitar solo motif, that wasn't enough to salvage such an ugly skeleton of a tune. Was she actually singing, ""Walking through a circus of/ Bloody ghouls and perfect fools/ Stupid little people who/ Think that they make all the rules""? I persevered against all better judgment, although by the third track, it was becoming alarmingly clear that this was little more than some copped blues riffs and traditional arrangements laced with misplaced folk-goth atmospherics and vaguely surfy guitars. It tasted like the recipe for musical Ipecac; things looked grim. How many times could they recycle weird, bass-heavy variations of ""The Worms Crawl In, the Worms Crawl Out"" with a funeral march arrangement (""Open Up the Walls"") and a surf instrumental arrangement (""Mortal Mirror"")? At times, they did manage to sound a little like some of the sparsest, most low-key offering from art-rockers Blonde Redhead (a compliment. Also, both bands were produced by the estimable Guy from Fugazi. Coincidence, or phenomenon?), but without any of the flare or vitality (not a compliment). The dismal trudge through the aural mud of Mortal Mirror wouldn't be easy, but duty called. Then, a shock! Track six... what was it? ""Sitting in the Park"" arrested with a pop bassline straight out of a slow crooner from the 50s, and vocals to match. The one thing I can say about Quixotic is that the vocal performances of the Billottes (they trade back and forth) were often quite beautiful, showing a great deal of range while maintaining enough ethereality to pass without a trace (if only the lyrics weren't so terrible). Christina's work on ""Sitting in the Park"" was astounding, and for once, the musical backdrop for her voice was up to the task. I wasn't surprised to discover, then, that it wasn't theirs. No, it was originally by Billy Stewart, and along with ""Tell It Like It Is"" by Aaron Neville and ""Lord of This World"" by Sabbath (Black Metal 4-Eva!), it was in a class by itself from the rest of Mortal Mirror. Bad band, good covers, imagine that shock. O, Canada, you know I love you and I'm only trying to look out for you. Why did you do it? Why export Quixotic and then stamp your good name all over it? Sure the covers are uniformly excellent, but that has a little something to do with the fact that they were written by other people. At the very least, it seems to me that if you listened to even one of the originals off this album, you'd want to keep your involvement as much of a secret as possible. It's not like you don't have plenty of fantastic national treasures to be proud of. It's misleading, anyway! Quixotic are from Washington, D.C.!",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6598-mortal-mirror/,Kill Rock Stars,2002.0,"Quix*o*tic's latest album, Mortal Mirror, is a musical masterpiece that fuses elements of electronic, pop/R&B, and rock. While some may be put off by the album's fairly modest rating of 3.6 out of 10, I must say that this is an incredibly underrated album that deserves much more attention.

The band, consisting of members Christina Billotte, Brendan Canty, and Mira Billotte, has a rich history that spans over two decades. Christina Billotte and Brendan Canty were both members of the influential punk band, Fugazi. Meanwhile, Mira Billotte has been active in the music scene since the mid-90s, working with bands such as The Spells and White Magic. Together, they have created an unorthodox yet cohesive sound that is unique to Quix*o*tic.

The creation story behind Mortal Mirror is just as fascinating as the band's history. The album was recorded over a period of several years, with the band taking their time to ensure that each track was perfect. Mira Billotte describes the album as a ""meditation on life and death,"" which is evident in the dark, brooding lyrics that are present throughout the album.

Personally, I found Mortal Mirror to be a deeply introspective work that took me on a journey through the highs and lows of life. The album's opening track, ""Pilot,"" sets the tone for the rest of the album with its slow, ambient instrumental. The album then picks up the pace with tracks such as ""The Breeze,"" which features Christina Billotte's haunting vocals, and ""Perfect Fit,"" which has a pop/R&B feel to it.

But it's really the album's final track, ""Sapphire,"" that truly captured my attention. The track is a slow burner that builds to a powerful crescendo towards the end, with Mira Billotte's vocals perfectly capturing the desperation and longing that is present in the lyrics.

Overall, Mortal Mirror is an incredibly unique and introspective album that is unfortunately overlooked. If you're a fan of electronic, pop/R&B, or rock music, I highly recommend giving this album a listen. You won't be disappointed.","Step 1: Review A includes informal language and informal tone while Review B has a formal language and a more objective tone.

M.A.N.D.Y.,Renaissance: The Mix Collection,Electronic,7.0,December 8 2009,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"This 2xCD mix set by M.A.N.D.Y. is bursting with the kind of low-key minimal/deep house goodness that obsessives probably snagged on vinyl (or at least a high bitrate mp3 rip) the week they were released. But it's M.A.N.D.Y.'s continual crossfader curveballs-- the gleeful ease with which the German duo blends in tasty bits from across rave history-- that will make older listeners take a second listen to what appears on first glance to be yet another tasteful compilation of recent DJ fodder. Renaissance: The Mix Session is that rare up-to-date dance document with room for beats-and-bass legends like Dynamix II and electronic-indie hybrids like Junior Boys and Schneider TM. M.A.N.D.Y. have used the platform provided by UK superclub imprint Renaissance-- which once meant you'd ascended to the ranks of dance music's money-making populist frontline-- to put together a history-lesson-cum-slow-burn showcase, rather than a cutesy game of connect-the-dots between Old Tune X and New Tune Y. The oldest selection is the Black Dog's ""Virtual"", first released in 1989, which blends so perfectly with DJ Koze's 2009 ""Mrs. Bojangels"" that proto-IDM and 21st-century freak-house are revealed as kissing cousins. At 40-plus tracks, there's enough new-ish music from all the usual Euro suspects to keep fans of spacey and streamlined late-aughts dance music happy well into 2010. But it's the outrÃ© and half-forgotten stuff, the odd little hooks and nostalgia-triggering throwbacks, strewn among the austere beeps and pulses, that will keep you coming back. Like the quasi-noise/rock weirdness from Gang Gang Dance; Sebastien Tellier's laid-back flutes and strings, the kind of super-pungent Francophile kitsch that will leave you shaking your head with bemused laughter; and Gui Boratto's remix of Bomb the Bass, which features the best (and moodiest) riff of the set, the kind New Order should still be cranking out. The Mix Session is hardly the mini-masterpiece that was M.A.N.D.Y.'s 2005 Body Language, which was similarly broad-minded while sticking to mostly then-current material. Instead of going era-defining, M.A.N.D.Y's eschewed a seamless run-through of 2009's greatest hits in order to craft that ere-rare dance music object: the idiosyncratic commercial mix CD that's both ""deep"" and pop-friendly. It takes guts to include a killer record-- like, say, Felix Da Housecat's ""Silver Screen (Shower Scene)""-- that's old but not quite yet ""classic."" You risk being greeted with groans from the innovation-fixated cranks that comprise a large chunk of your audience. Maybe you think it's troubling that M.A.N.D.Y. have managed to stand out from the identikit minimal/deep pack simply by tossing in some moldy oldies-but-goodies, but I find their cross-genre/decade fearlessness refreshing. If nothing else we can all agree that it's surely the only mix we'll ever see to feature both Robag Wruhme and Mark Lanegan, Dominik Eulberg and P. Diddy.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13764-renaissance-the-mix-collection/,Renaissance,2009.0,"If you're a fan of electronic music, you've most likely heard of M.A.N.D.Y. - the German duo consisting of Patrick Bodmer and Philipp Jung. These producers have been active since the early 2000s, and have been known for their exceptional mixing styles that incorporates techno, deep house, and electro-house genres.

Their 2005 album, 'Renaissance: The Mix Collection', remains one of the landmark electronic music albums of the early 2000s. The album is a compilation of M.A.N.D.Y.'s personal favourites, showcasing their extraordinary prowess for synthesizing sounds and crafting astonishingly cohesive mixes.

I still remember the first time I heard 'Renaissance: The Mix Collection', and how it blew me away with its bold experimentation and technicality. The album comprises two CDs, each one packed with unique tracks that take the listener on a roller-coaster ride through electronic music's pinnacle moments.

The opening track, 'Falling up' by Theo Parrish, is a perfect introduction to the unique sound that M.A.N.D.Y. have crafted for this mix. The track is characterized by shimmering synths and minimal drum beats, which are soon replaced with heavy basslines and soulful vocals. The transitions between each track on this album are so seamless that you'd be forgiven for not noticing that a new track has started.

M.A.N.D.Y.'s mixing technique is masterful and it shows in the way they layer tracks on top of each other, creating a complex and mesmerizing soundscape for the listener. This skill is exemplified in the second CD of 'Renaissance: The Mix Collection', with the track 'DubBeGoodToMe' by Beats International that winds its way through various genres, including reggae, house, and hip-hop.

One of the standout tracks for me is 'In White Rooms' by Booka Shade, an atmospheric electro-house track that's both haunting and mesmerizing. The lead synth hook is catchy and memorable, making this track an absolute classic of the genre.

While there are a few moments on 'Renaissance: The Mix Collection' that may not resonate with every listener, the overall experience is sensational. This album is a testament to the skill and creativity of M.A.N.D.Y. and the electronic music scene in the early 2000s.

In conclusion, 'Renaissance: The Mix Collection' is a must-have for electronic music enthusiasts, particularly those who are interested in exploring the roots of techno and house. The seamless mixing, unparalleled selection of tracks and the duo's uncanny ability to create a mesmerizing soundscape are what make this album a classic. It's an inspiring piece of work that still holds up to scrutiny today, showcasing the brilliance of M.A.N.D.Y. and their craft.","1.

Burzum,Umskiptar,Metal,3.3,June 8 2012,Grayson Currin,Contributor,"In 2012, the only thing more boring than talking about the past of pioneering musician, divisive theorist, and infamous loudmouth Varg Vikernes, aka Count Grishnackh, is listening to the music he's now releasing as Burzum. More than two decades ago, Vikernes became a pillar of emergent black metal, both for the wildly emotive and ruthless qualities of his best records and for his status as the anti-Christian wildchild who burned churches and murdered his bud/label owner/rival, Mayhem guitarist Euronymous. While locked away for some combination of those crimes, he continued to push the reach of black metal, both stylistically and socially: Though they're little more than ham-fisted neo-classical baubles, the pair of electronic albums Vikernes recorded while in prison certainly helped presage the form's recent sprawl. What's more, while behind bars, Vikernes played a star role-- the troubled philosopher-poet, standing up for his country and his ego-- in Lords of Chaos, the 1998 non-fiction black metal journal that did so well it warranted a second edition. More than a decade later, the documentary Until the Light Takes Us caught him talking radicalism (and cereal) in his jail-time get-up. So, yes, without Vikernes, the black metal story doesn't happen, or at least it doesn't get book-deal interesting or, consequently, quite so popular to another generation of pissed-off kids who've since turned the sound inside out. But if Vikernes had never made another Burzum album after his release from prison in 2009, the world probably wouldn't have demanded one. He did, though, and setting aside the controversy about the artist, his album titles, or the incredibly stupid name of his label (""Byelobog,"" or ""Whitegod,"" or ""Fucking obvious move, Varg""), those records-- 2010's strange Belus and last year's ferocious The Fallen-- were actually quite good. They didn't necessarily change the perceptions of Burzum or expand the conceptions of the music Vikernes made, but they did serve as a reminder that Burzum mattered outside the context of his vileness. In the past seven months, however, he's done his best to obviate that idea: Last November, he released From the Depths of Darkness, an 11-track collection that combined three short instrumentals pieces with eight re-recordings of Burzum classics from his first two full-lengths. Despite the resurrection suggested by the title, Darkness was as pointless as it was bad, not so much recalling past successes as detracting from them. Still, the familiarity with those songs made them more bearable than those on the new Umskiptar, an album that's only listenable to the extent that it's laughable. Vikernes based Umskiptar on ""Völuspá"", a 66-stanza poem that serves as the Norse creation-destruction-rebuilding myth and is essential to Vikernes' ignominious nationalist ideology. He sings the story in his native tongue, his plain baritone dispensing the tale with minimal inflection, as though he were a droll history teacher or minister relaying a foundational message yet again. (If you're interested in the poem's translation, the website of the keenly capitalist Vikernes suggests picking up the special edition of his 2011 book, Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia; or you could simply Google ""Völuspá in English"" and save your money.) In an early press release for Umskiptar, Vikernes explained that the album keys on ""a strong focus on atmosphere."" Though Vikernes has never been one for songcraft so much as feeling, Umskiptar feels particularly void of structure or direction. It's as if that attention to environment and ancient text prompted Vikernes to write and record Umskiptar as though no one else would actually listen to it. Maybe it's best to think of it as a personal-religious trance, then, and to just keep out. There are occasionally interesting textures, like the submerged piano that opens ""Alfadanz"" or the way the winding guitars in the back half of ""Hit Helga Tré"" give Vikernes' exposed voice some much-needed authoritative lift. But the songs here barely deserve that title. ""Níðhöggr"", for instance, finds Vikernes whispering over field recordings, a bass drum, and a distant, wobbly tone that splits the difference between a trumpet feeding back and a Steven R. Smith guitar meander; its aim seems eerie, but it's mostly amusing, another moment of forced seriousness from a fellow who would do well to find another strategy. ""Níðhöggr"" serves as the start of the big, closing build that culminates with ""Gullaldr"", a 10-minute latticework of tension so rote that it makes every Slint-loving post-rock band of post-grads sound interesting by comparison. On ""Heiðr"", Vikernes buries his incantations between sheets of black-metal guitar screech, occasionally peeling the noise away to emphasize the drama. Once again, it just sounds silly, making it a fitting preamble for ""Valgaldr"", an eight-minute bog in which he wraps ghoulish harmonies around distorted riffs. It's like Iron Maiden on Thorazine, except worse than that might seem. Even during the decade Vikernes spent in jail without producing new material, he's represented an interesting conversational point among music fans: How do you treat the legacy and possibly fresh output of someone who's done so much to build a sound while concomitantly doing so much to make everyone associated with it look like a cruel, racist, ignorant simpleton? Is it best to ignore him completely or to embrace him for what he is-- an egoist and/or idiot capable of making occasionally interesting art, possibly because of those views? There are, of course, those who dismiss any mention of him and those who treat his politics and deeds as though they stand separate from his music. (There are others who simply agree with him. Best of luck?) Some walk a middle ground with Vikernes, lambasting his views while lauding what his music has accomplished. He's become something of a meme, and when Metal Sucks covered the ""news"" that he is working on a role-playing game of his own, they aptly introduced him as the ""murdering bigot fuckhead Varg Vikernes."" There are, of course, no ultimately correct answers for such a difficult debate-- essentially, an argument not only about freedom of speech but the limits of art and of cults of personality. Coupled with From the Depths of Darkness, Umskiptar makes it easier to find a slightly more satisfying remedy: Varg Vikernes is, as advertised, ""a murdering bigot fuckhead"" whose string of interesting-to-important records has now faded into such formless, hapless bullshit that even Odin likely doesn't care. That has to burn, Varg.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16640-umskiptar/,Byelobog,2012.0,"If you're a metal enthusiast, you must have heard of Burzum. The one-man black metal project hailing from Norway has gained notoriety for its controversial past and unorthodox approach to music. In 2012, Burzum released its tenth studio album, 'Umskiptar,' which garnered a polarized reaction from fans and critics alike. In this review, I'll delve into the history of Burzum and the creation story behind 'Umskiptar' and share my personal experience and opinions about the album.

Burzum was formed in 1991 by Varg Vikernes, who assumed the stage name Count Grishnackh. Vikernes was involved in the early Norwegian black metal scene, which was infamous for its church burnings and murders. In 1993, Vikernes was convicted of the murder of fellow musician Øystein Aarseth (Euronymous), and was imprisoned for 21 years. Despite this controversy, Burzum's music has maintained a cult following even after Vikernes' release from prison in 2009.

'Umskiptar' was released in 2012, and it marks a departure from Burzum's previous works. Vikernes stated that the album focused on the theme of transformation, inspired by Norse mythology. The album's title roughly translates to ""Metamorphosis"" in English. 'Umskiptar' features a more minimalist approach to music than Burzum's earlier albums, which will surprise some fans, and turn off others.

The album opens with a track called ""Blóðstokkinn"" and sets the mood for the rest of the album with its slow, repetitive riffing and haunting atmosphere. The vocals are typical for Burzum's music, with Vikernes' low growls seeming almost inhuman at times. The album's highlight track is ""Alfadanz,"" which has an unusual melody created by a blend of acoustic guitars and droning synths. Other tracks like ""Hit helga Tré"" and ""Galgi"" maintain the album's brooding, introspective vibe.

As a longtime Burzum fan, I must say that 'Umskiptar' was a mixed bag for me. On one hand, I appreciate the album's simplistic approach to black metal, which is refreshing in an era where overproduction and technicality have become the norm. On the other hand, some tracks on the album feel unfinished, almost as if Vikernes lost interest halfway through the writing process. The album's slower pace may also be a turn-off for some metal fans who prefer faster, more aggressive music.

In conclusion, 'Umskiptar' is not Burzum's strongest effort, nor is it its weakest. It's an album that will polarize fans and critics, and that's precisely what I appreciate the most about it. Burzum has never catered to fans, and 'Umskiptar' is no exception. If you're looking for an unconventional, moody, and thought-provoking metal album, then give 'Umskiptar' a try. But, if you're looking for Burzum's signature sound, crank up 'Filosofem' instead.","Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine which review is human-written:

- Review A is longer and more detailed, with a more critical tone towards the album and the artist behind it, Varg Vikernes.
- Review B is shorter and more focused on the album's sound, themes, and its place within Burzum's discography. It also includes the author's personal experience and appreciation for Burzum's music.
- Review A uses more complex sentence structures, including some rhetorical questions and references to other works related to Burzum and black metal.
- Review B uses simpler sentence structures and more straightforward language, making it easier to read and follow.
- Review A includes more cultural and historical references, such as the Norse creation myth, the documentary Until the Light Takes Us, and the Metal Sucks website.

Nick Forté,Pasted Lakes,Experimental,6.7,September 29 2003,Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,"Unlike the attic that stores away those forgotten, tuneless chord changes you tentatively composed back in the seventh grade, computers unforgivingly archive even the most tangential, half-remembered experiments. Taken as a whole, the digitized narrative's abortive starts and eventual triumphs transform a lifeless hard drive into a fractured bildungsroman that traces the lopsided development of its anonymous archivist. On Pasted Lakes, unwilling to click and drag his nascent apprenticeship into the trash, Brooklyn-based Nick Forté remixes and recontextualizes the slapdash scraps and cutouts of his first forays into computer music, creating a mixed bag of jaggedly lurching electro experiments initially intended to fit together as a different album entirely. Draping this recycled project in a futuristic atomic-era floor plan, Forté levitates stylistically between muted Lesser and highly caffeinated Nobukaza Takemura; though he mentions utilizing the rhythmic pacing of Wire and The Minutemen as a guide for his work, that particular swing isn't apparent beyond the theoretical nod. Assuming he had found a way to harness the spirit of Double Nickels on the Dime or a fraction of the energy from his work as a guitarist in early 90s hardcore mainstays Rorschach or his later staccato slicing in NYC post-punks Computer Cougar, this stuff would absolutely sizzle with crunchy dynamics, a microwave stuffed with pastel paint samples. Instead, like Christmas Decorations-- his pretty but vacant Kranky-released ambient project with Steve Silverstein-- Pasted Lakes is largely a patch of disjointed background music suffering from snippet sizing and thin Yars' Revenge formations. The first track on the album, ""Green Language"", provides the exception. Here, on the longest and most dynamically sustained piece on the album, Forté creates a richly detailed floatation device suggesting a tide pool in its tiny waves of asymmetrical percussion, shimmering loops, tonal refraction, and a mooning guitar's hum like a digitized gull escaping into the rocky brush. Another strong track, ""Blender Dance"" works along two strands: gentle percussion powered by shiny star reflections torn apart with a ratty tonal loop. More reminiscent of poor-man dadaist Phil Milstein than the high-modernist gloss of Mouse on Mars or Oval, the other works flit and flutter as brief sound-effect montages; some heave and hurl and fold inward, others stagger over sine waves or burrow through logarithms, but none take off or swagger into different dimensions. ""Sugar Lemoned"" is slowcore Gamelan played with digitized kazoos; ""Did You Feel That?"" falls into Space Invaders territory. Likewise, ""Swallowing Gel"" is a flatulent Atari attack from congested locusts. Bits like ""Crack and Crevice"" and ""Kill Your Carpet"" coast at a slower pace, without managing to shift the tonal quality of the work. But all isn't lost. While Forté's leftovers do lack the depth and textured spaciousness of more experienced progenitors of CPU riffage, the rugged punk-rock heart beating behind his often beautiful collages produces a sense of gleeful discovery absent on more dryly established productions. And that's a small good thing.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3258-pasted-lakes/,Schematic,2003.0,"If you're a fan of experimental music, then Nick Forté's ""Pasted Lakes"" is definitely an album you'll want to check out. With a rating of 6.7 out of 10, the album features a wide range of sounds and musical influences that combine to create a truly unique listening experience.

Before diving into the album itself, let's take a moment to explore the band's history and the creation story of ""Pasted Lakes"". Nick Forté is a musician and producer based in Los Angeles, with a passion for crafting eclectic music that blends genres, moods, and textures. Drawing inspiration from everything from jazz to electronic, Forté is known for his ability to blend seemingly disparate elements into a cohesive whole.

""Pasted Lakes"" is a perfect example of this approach. The album features a diverse range of instruments and sounds, including drums, synths, pianos, and even vocal samples. Each track showcases a different aspect of Forté's musical repertoire, from the jazzy grooves of ""Moon Lakes"" to the atmospheric soundscapes of ""Horses in the Fog"".

Personally, I was blown away by the sheer range of sounds and styles present on this album. As someone who enjoys experimental music, I found myself constantly surprised and delighted by the twists and turns each track took. There were moments of frenetic energy, like the glitchy beats of ""Lone Elm"" and moments of wistful contemplation, like the melancholy beauty of ""Island Song"".

One of my favorite tracks on the album was ""Treo Palm"", which features a mesmerizing vocal sample that repeats over a backdrop of dreamy synths and floating chords. It's the kind of track that transports you to another realm entirely, and I found myself putting it on repeat for hours at a time.

Overall, ""Pasted Lakes"" is an impressive and endlessly fascinating album that showcases Nick Forté's incredible talent as a musician and producer.

Sally Shapiro,Disco Romance,"Electronic,Rock",8.5,January 9 2007,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"A few dozen ""2006: Year of You"" think pieces later, we know a lot about ""You"": Web 2.0 has democratized the media, caught the eye of corporations from Silicon Valley to Detroit, and sparked new ways to call 'em as we see 'em.

Just six months ago, songwriter/producer Johan Agebjörn started posting on message boards announcing her debut 12"" ""I'll Be By Your Side""-- Pitchfork's #27 track of 2006. Not since Tigermilk-era Belle and Sebastian has an artist gotten so much publicity from refusing to do publicity. Here, as then, such reticence befits the music, which speaks, sensitively and eloquently, for itself. ""I'll Be By Your Side"" returns to open Shapiro's first full-length, Disco Romance. Like Tigermilk's ""The State I Am In"", it's an auspicious introduction to an, ohhh, introverted world. Agebjörn's Italo-inspired tracks build gradually, drop melodies that could melt whatever global warming leaves behind, and then hold on for dear life. Shapiro's guileless vocals put an angelic face on her producer's melancholy, but she, too, is clinging to the past. Disco Romance is deeply nostalgic. It's the nostalgia of someone who has loved and lost and knows damn well it was indeed ""better""-- no matter how gnawing the present hurt. Sure, Italo's comeback has been here for years. Just ask Morgan Geist, Alec DeRuggiero, Hans-Peter Lindstrøm, or Mrs. Guy Ritchie. Fundamentally a modern indie pop album (dig the cover art's references to old Heavenly and Field Mice design schemes), Disco Romance uses its sonic heritage not so much as a blueprint as for thematic material. Though German label ZYX Music didn't coin the term until 1983, Italo disco began when the strings, horns, and sweaty glitz of the Village People, K.C. & the Sunshine Band, or ""Disco Duck"" gave way to something new: an electronic-based amalgam of throbbing bass lines, aching synth arpeggios, and low-tech drum thuds. Like 80s house or 90s lo-fi, the genre that sprang almost fully formed from Giorgio Moroder's knobs, via Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"", was cheap and easy to imitate. In Agebjörn's hands, Italo is also essentially sad: Perhaps the first dance music made in solitude. ""I'll Be By Your Side"" draws its emotional depth from the way the arrangement implicitly contradicts Shapiro's vows of eternal togetherness. Detouring into intergalactic lounge, ""I Know"" shows its lonely narrator's struggle to go on believing those promises. If Shapiro really knows, then why does she have to keep telling herself so-- why are those squiggly synth solos so tragic? ""Just tell me how I can hold onto this moment for now,"" she asks. The key changes, bass dives, and our moment extends for another two minutes. Back on paper, the album should be as giddy as it makes Pitchfork HQ. After all, Agebjörn's love-oriented songs mostly polish up the simple, frequently nonsensical lyrics of classic Italo. ""Be mine in the sunshine,"" Shapiro sings on ""Hold Me So Tight"", but it's beneath a deluge of rainy-day synths. Even on ""Anorak Christmas"", a cover of Swedish twee-poppers Nixon, Shapiro sings the words ""please don't go away"" as if she doesn't plan to be heard. ""Find My Soul"" reaches out a trembling hand, and ambient lullaby ""Sleep in My Arms"" is as desolate as a Star Trek captain's log. Disco Romance turns the Smiths' happy-music-with-sad-lyrics formulation on its head-- and then you dance to it. Yep, style is ephemeral. Agebjörn can't bring back vanished innocence by recreating the sounds of our youth any more than Shapiro can keep love alive just by saying the words. They can, however, control the emotional experience of anyone who has ears-- now, and as long as their songs remain available in some form. Disco Romance takes history's revision process into its own hands with two remixes, one a slick ""Norwegian electrojazz"" take on ""Find My Soul"" and the other Netherlands electro artist Rude66's vocoder-ghostly, acid-squelched ""I'll Be By Your Side"" revamp. They're not new songs, but they provide another means of prolonging the present. The Web's cacophony privileges criticism. You won't find God in scriptural commentaries, or save any children watching Hotel Rwanda, but you can fall in love to ""My Love"" (in theory). If verbalization is inherently reductive, then writing about music is a way to encode the moment loss-free. The track always endures. In his book Air Guitar, MacArthur Fellowship-winning arts critic Dave Hickey explains: ""Even though my writing about art might momentarily intervene between some object and its beholders, the words would wash away, and the writing, if it was written successfully into its historical instant, could never actually replace the work or banish it into the realm of knowledge."" All that lasts is music; Shapiro and Agebjörn know.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9751-disco-romance/,"Paper Bag,Diskokaine",2006.0,"It's not often that I stumble across a record that captures the essence of an era with such precision, but Disco Romance by Sally Shapiro does just that. Sitting at the intersection of electronic and rock music, Shapiro manages to bring the best of both worlds to the dancefloor, and her knack for nostalgic soundscapes turns this album into a journey through a lost age of music.

One of the most impressive aspects of Disco Romance is the attention to detail in its production. Shapiro draws upon vintage synthesizers and drum machines to craft a sound that evokes the glittering disco balls of the 70s, and the rock staples of the 80s. Shapiro’s exquisite voice is the standout instrument throughout the album, almost as if it is a nostalgic dream that transports you back to the era in which it belongs.

Shapiro’s debut album was created in 2006 when the artist wanted to pay tribute to a lost era of music — the smooth disco dance floors of the 70s and the synthesizer-led pop of the 80s. You can hear it in her music style; her synth-heavy electronic arrangements embody the pure, uncut sound of the era, while her vocals evoke the same sense of romantic detachment and desire you'll find in classic disco tracks like ""I Will Survive.""

Disco Romance features eight tracks, all of which have a different texture and feel while still fitting seamlessly within the album's sonic universe. Dance tracks like ""I Know"" and ""He Keeps Me Alive"" rely heavily on the syncopated bass lines and glittering synth arpeggios that provide a strong pulse to the album, while ballads like ""Jackie Jackie"" and ""Hold Me So Tight"" offer a more delicate, emotive touch. Every song is superbly catchy and positively oozes with vitality and energy.

But where Disco Romance truly shines is its reiteration of classic disco themes. The album is imbued with the same deep sadness and soulful yearning that underscores the best disco tracks, a reflection of the times in which it was written. Shapiro's lyrics read like a love letter to a lost era of dance and music, a call to arms to get up and dance.

As far as personal experience goes, Disco Romance is one of those albums that draws you in from the first bar of music and doesn't let go. It’s an album to lose yourself to on a long drive, late at night, with the windows rolled down and the glittering lights of the city flashing by. Whether you're a diehard disco fan or simply looking for a good danceable album, Disco Romance is one that should not be missed.

Overall, Sally Shapiro's Disco Romance turns one's memories of disco on its head with an array of modern electronic beats and reverberating rock-inspired genres. Thanks to her pure voice and eye for detail, the album deserves its ratting of 8.5 out of 10 in every sense of the phrase. It is a love letter to all that came before us, and is an absolute treasure to experience.","1. Review A is longer and more complex in sentence structure.

The Futureheads,This Is Not the World,"Electronic,Rock",6.2,May 29 2008,Adam Moerder,,"When 2006's News & Tributes, with its restless genre-surfing and morose aura, didn't move units, 679 dropped the Futureheads, who in turn eagerly started their own label, Nul Recordings. Now, unbound from the shackles of corporate pressure, the Sunderland band finally has a chance to spread its wings, to enjoy the sort of creative freedom artists like Radiohead or NIN have relished, to boldly chase its muse to the ends of the earth. Ladies and gentlemen, the Futureheads present This Is Not the World, an...economy-size power-pop album? Apparently the backlash from Tributes hasn't scared the band away from penning three-minute pop standards; it's only convinced them to package their songs in a neater, more cohesive fashion. Miffed by Tributes' acoustic guitar sighs and less-than-syncopated textures? Well, World force-feeds the listener with one heaping helping of homogeneous overdriven riffs and fist-pumping choruses after another. The vocals similarly raise the stakes, broadening their focus from the tearfully quotidian to blistering anthems attacking society on the whole, likely a byproduct of their recent career shakeup. Opener ""The Beginning of the Twist"" may ostensibly refer to a romantic relationship, but Barry Hyde's rallying cry (""It's time to wake up/ It's time to change"") feels like snarky self-commentary, foreshadowing the in-your-face persona the band's adopted on World. Since their self-titled debut, the Futureheads have gone from crafting intricate, mathematical post-punk with a pop edge to crafting full-blown power-pop with a hint of Elvis Costello/Ric Ocasek geek chic. Missing here are most of the Wire and XTC signifiers and the ADD songwriting that fired off one robotic riff after another with Pentium processor precision, verse/chorus structure be damned. The sweeping power chords of songs like ""Think Tonight"" and the title track will betray nearly every preconception you've had of this band. Not only do these tracks stick to conventional song structures, they even go as far as to anticipate their massive sing-along refrains with dramatic intros and pre-choruses. I haven't checked, but it's likely many of these songs, especially the handful with avalanche-style descending major scale riffs, synch up eerily well with Cheap Trick's ""Surrender"". Fortunately, just because the hooks are swollen doesn't mean they're not catchy as hell. While neither as frenetic as the group's debut or as stylistically curious as Tributes, World boasts smart pop sensibilities all the same. ""Broke Up the Time"" is an unashamed carousel ride around an ultra-sunny riff, not any more guilty than a tongue-in-cheek song like R.E.M.'s ""Stand"". ""Sale of the Century"" grinds down a herky-jerky Go4 groove until it's as palatable as a harmless Franz Ferdinand ditty, while standout track ""Radio Heart"" represents the best possible outcome for the band's new artistic direction. Pinching the meaty guitar slabs from 2006 single ""Skip to the End"", the track's skewed chord progression and galloping melody make for three minutes of near pop perfection, replete with a Pygmalion-esque confluence of art and love, ""a girl with a radio heart."" Hyde's lyrics are especially gripping considering how his band's toils somewhere between abstract, cerebral post-punk and mainstream rock, never quite mortgaging one for greater success in the other. The sad truth, though, is that the Futureheads were never a band that got by solely on hooks, but rather their unorthodox delivery of them. Aside from their endearing Sunderland accents, they've 86'd every ace previously kept up their sleeve. Without the quad-approved a cappella harmonies, explosive stop-start melodies, and edge-of-seat rhythms, these guys can't distinguish themselves quite so clearly from the UK's post-punk hoi polloi anymore. Maybe it's just the subliminal suggestion of the group's moniker, or a revisionist nostalgia for their debut's slap-in-the-face urgency, but World feels sadly complacent coming from a band that once wielded so much restless, forward-thinking innovation. Hopefully the plodding nature of this album means the band's simply stabilizing after some label turmoil, and not, as the weakest parts of World suggest, already running on empty.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11556-this-is-not-the-world/,Nul,2008.0,"The Futureheads' ""This Is Not the World"" is a true milestone in the band's career. This album, released in 2008, is a beautiful blend of electronic and rock that showcases the band's unique sound and incredible musicality. With a rating of 6.2 out of 10, this album may not have received the recognition it deserves, but it certainly deserves to be put on repeat.

For those who may not be familiar with The Futureheads, they are a British post-punk band that formed in 2000. Known for their incredible harmonies and energetic sound, they have been regarded as one of the most innovative indie rock bands of the early 2000s. ""This Is Not the World"" was their third studio album and represented a shift in their sound.

The album's creation story is just as fascinating as the music itself. The band moved to New York City to record with producer Youth, who has worked with famous musicians such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Primal Scream, and Depeche Mode. In an interview with the BBC, the band said that their time in New York was a key factor in the album's sound, as they were inspired by the energy of the city and the diverse music scene.

But what exactly makes ""This Is Not the World"" such a standout album? For starters, the vocals on this album are incredible. The harmonies are tight and complex, and the lead singer's delivery is both emotional and powerful. The lyrics are also noteworthy, as the album touches on themes of love, loss, and the complexity of relationships.

One standout track is ""The Beginning of the Twist,"" which was the album's lead single. The infectious melody and driving rhythm make it impossible not to dance along. Another standout track is ""Radio Heart,"" a slower ballad that showcases the band's ability to create emotional and introspective music.

From start to finish, ""This Is Not the World"" is a cohesive and well-crafted album. It's an energetic and emotional ride that will leave you wanting more. While the album may not have received the fame it deserves, it's definitely worth checking out for any fan of rock, electronic, or just good music in general.

As a fan of The Futureheads, I was initially skeptical of ""This Is Not the World"" and the band's move towards a more electronic sound. However, after giving the album a chance, I was blown away. The energy and emotion of these songs are palpable, and I found myself coming back to this album time and time again.

In conclusion, ""This Is Not the World"" is a must-listen for any music lover. It's a testament to The Futureheads' musical talent and innovation and a standout album in their impressive discography. Give it a listen and prepare to be blown away.","Review A is the model generated review, while Review B is the human written review.

Four Tet,Rounds,Electronic,8.2,May 4 2003,Andy Beta,Contributor,"Free jazz drummer Milford Graves has a nice trick that he performs at his shows: He brings someone in the audience up on stage and asks them to feel for his heart rate. It starts out steady, but as the person holds both wrists, it slows, and Graves begins to diverge his bloodstream on either side of his body, finally achieving an internal polyrhythmic pulse between the two points. Then he jumps behind his kit and clatters away in ecstasy. Four Tet's lone member, Kieran Hebden, is fascinated with the impossible rhythms that the free-form jazz greats could bang out as they pleased. Whether or not he's taking a page out of Milford Graves' book is debatable, but he opens ""Hands"" with a cardiac sample fibrillating into a multi-limbed percussive rattle of densely edited and seemingly random drum hit samples that just starts to stroke Barry Altschul's beard before locking down into a hip-hop groove. He fades the cymbals' sizzles into the pseudo-Clyde Stubblefield sticks of ""She Moves She"", a cycling song evenly spaced with wheeling rimshots, scattered gongs, and funky string plucks that veer around the car horns that bleat past. ""My Angel Rocks Back and Forth"" gently blows iron-lung sighs through ride cymbals and dirty, run-out grooves while an austere piano twinkles, hinting at the sort of gentle sounds Hebden will soon weave around English folk legend Vashti Bunyan. Verging on the lugubrious is the nine-minute ""Unspoken"" (whose piano riff is lifted from, of all sources, Tori Amos' ""Winter""), but Hebden's touch keeps it from morass. Here, he controls his ingredients-- fictitious soundbytes of early Gato Barbieri sax, a plaintive finger or two from McCoy Tyner, broken chimes, backwards feedback, and a DJ Shadow kickdrum-- keeping them at a contemplative simmer, rather than allowing them to come to a full boil. ""Chia"" is a tabla-bubbling conduit to the mod bass and shimmying sitar of ""As Serious as Your Life"", namechecking the crucial free-jazz text by Val Wilmer, yet standing much closer to Miles Davis' On the Corner, with those odd-metered handclaps and that stuttering punch of a Jack DeJohnette hi-hat. With metallophone ripples at a wake, ""And They All Look Broken Hearted"" is an abstract and solemn affair, recalling the oddly melodic cadence of a player like Bobby Hutcherson, and with spliced drum solos swirling around some affected harpsichord and vibraphones like club smoke, Hebden captures the cool sadness of old Blue Note posters. It sounds like a shoo-in for the album's closing track, but it instead leads up to ""Slow Jam"", which has that long goodbye of the best melancholy closers, a circle game of echoing footsteps, fitful static, gleeful kazoos, lulling guitar repetitions, and shadows surely sinking in, revolving all disparate sounds to resolution. Freely moving in and out of cycles, able to coalesce or evanesce in a heartbeat, straight up and down, or else banging about like a toddler on the pot shelf, Rounds funnels every element through the drum, which always remains at the forefront of the mix. But what gives this record its internal order, and allows it to stand out against previous laptop explorations of immense record collections, is the other genres Hebden dabbles in and draws upon to flesh out the beat. Though hardly obvious the first time through, there's the supple, propulsive fun of funk, as well as the pastoral placidity of folk, both moving over the cut-up rhythms like cumulous clouds, allowing hot light through at some junctures, but cooling things out with a darker umbrage in others. Rounds may not be ""as serious as your life,"" as one track proclaims, but it does feel that pulse.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3166-rounds/,Domino,2003.0,"Electronic music has been around for quite some time now, and one artist that has remained constant in the scene is Four Tet. I recently listened to his album ""Rounds"" and was blown away by its intricate soundscapes and compelling beats. With an impressive rating of 8.2 out of 10, this album definitely deserves a engaging and insightful review.

For those who may not be familiar with Four Tet, he is a British musician and producer, real name Kieran Hebden, known for his unique approach to electronic music. He has been a prominent figure in the music industry for over two decades, with a rich history of collaborations and innovative productions.

""Rounds"" was released in 2003 and marked an important turning point in Four Tet's career. This album marked a shift from his earlier sound, and saw him incorporating more acoustic instruments and live instrumentation. This album's sound has been described as psychedelic folk mixed with electronic beats, and I couldn't agree more.

From the very first track ""Hands"", I could tell this would be a sonic journey, where every corner is navigated with care and skill. The use of percussive elements and ethereal pads in the song almost take me to a different dimension. The track ""She Moves She"" is probably my favorite on the album. I'm always impressed by the way Four Tet manipulates the sounds to create an aura of pure euphoria, and this track is no exception. The closing cut ""I'm on Fire"" takes us on a very different ride from the rest of the album. The slow and ambient track creates an introspective feeling, where the listener is lost in their thoughts. 

What stands out about ""Rounds"" is not only the impressive production, but how it immerses the listener in the experience. The music paints vivid landscapes of emotions and resonates with the audience on a deeper level. It is a cohesive journey that takes you through different emotions, and enough room for each track to breathe and stand out on its own.

In conclusion, ""Rounds"" by Four Tet is a timeless classic that showcases both innovative production techniques and an open-minded approach in sound selection. It is a masterpiece that can still be enjoyed after almost two decades, as it manages to remain fresh and innovative to this day. It has personally become a favorite record of mine, and one that I will continue to revisit again and again. I highly recommend this album to anyone seeking an immersive and introspective electronic music experience, and rating of 8.2 from critics only supports that claim.","1.

Moby,18,Electronic,2.6,May 19 2002,David M. Pecoraro,,"Say what you will about Moby, but the guy's always been good for throwing his audience a left-handed curveball. Back in the mid-90s, when it seemed safe to assume he was about as popular as he was likely to get, Richard Melville Hall followed up his mostly Eurodance-inspired Everything Is Wrong with a grunge record, then followed that with a disc of film scores and a full-on ambient record under the bastard alias Voodoo Child. So when Play dropped back in '99, the oddly infectious mix of scratchy old blues recordings, MIDI keyboards and programmed drums seemed like an intriguing development in Moby's sound-- but no one dared assume it would become his sound. Anyone living within ten miles of a TV or radio pretty much knows the story from here. Idealistic hipster trades actual idealism for the 2-D MTV version that-- it turns out-- pays a helluva lot better, inadvertently scores two-thirds of commercials produced in the following three years, and oh yeah, there's that whole international superstar thing. If the threat of never achieving massive superstardom never frightened Moby into fitting his music into a mold, then the actual attainment of superstar status has. As a follow-up, 18 plays it safer than a quadruple-condomed fundamentalist Christian at an abstinence rally. So, yes, in case you were wondering, 18 does sound a lot like Play-- almost song-for-song, in fact. But any manager can tell you that the best way to achieve commercial success is to Stick With What Works. Here, Moby shows us why he's a star and not a starmaker-- by actually sampling from the same sources! Couldn't get enough of that chanteuse shrouded in tape hiss who sings, ""Ooh Lordy, troubles so hard,"" on that Pentium III commercial? Well, here's another one just like her, singing, ""Lordy, don't leave me all by myself."" See? Different. For ""In My Heart,"" Moby sets a crackly old gospel singer against piano lines that way too closely recall the ones on ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"" (which, by the way, was already a mere variation on a Philip Glass piece). There's plenty more to dislike about 18, like the monotonous thumps of already-dated drum machines, the painfully repetitive nature of so many of these sounds, or the simplistic keyboard noodling in the background of half these songs. Or inconsequential lyrics like those in the opening track (""People may come together/ And people may fall apart/ No one can stop us now/ 'Cause we are all made of stars""), or those that serve as the refrain to ""Extreme Ways"" (""Oh baby, oh baby, then it fell apart, it fell apart""). But we're veering dangerously close into the realm of personal taste, and I see no reason to reduce my argument to aesthetics, when I know that tons of people get off on this kind of cheese. But there's plenty of stuff wrong with 18 that's much harder to debate-- stuff that has nothing whatsoever to do with my personal likes and dislikes. For one, 18 is such a blatantly commercial affair I can't help but feel pandered to. Any pretext of cohesiveness is crushed under the heel of A&R;'s blatant attempts to sell this album to as many demographics as humanly possible. There's an indie rock song (""Great Escape,"" featuring would-be scenesters Azure Ray doing their best Mimi-from-Low impression), a hip-hop song (""Jam for the Ladies,"" featuring Angie Stone and MC Lyte), and, worst of all, a weepy adult contemporary-friendly slow jam featuring none other than Sinead O'Connor (actual so-sappy-I-fell-off-my-chair-and-broke-my-tailbone-laughing lyric: ""The sadness flows like water and washes down the heartache""). Those songs that aren't graced by guest appearances all sound crafted from the same mold-- Play-style sampled blues and gospel set to the same sort of cornily uplifting ambient soundscapes and basic keyboard noodlery Moby's been mucking around with for years-- though it sounds less inspired now than ever. For an album three years in the making, 18 sure does sound like it was tossed together at the last minute. It would seem Moby's artistic growth has been stunted by his suddenly packed social schedule. One gets the feeling from the songs on 18 that Moby's more interested in introducing music videos and being unfunny with Winona Ryder on Saturday Night Live than he is in making music. The only thing that differs from Moby's former work here are the liner notes. Before Play, Moby had earned a reputation for the well-crafted, often persuasive essays he included with each album. He damned cultural conservatism, cigarettes, celebrity and fundamentalism, while promoting an agenda of conservation, vegetarianism, and animal and prisoner rights. 18 has merely two essays: one about the difficulty of writing essays and the process of creating the album at hand, the other politely suggesting that everybody be nice to each other. Can someone please explain to me why, in a time when Moby's voice is louder than ever, and when cultural conservatism and fundamentalist dogma aims to destroy what few freedoms we as a nation have left, Moby would choose to back down? Maybe MTV built an android Moby with the remarkable ability to look cute in Pumas and to pilfer through the real Moby's back catalog and rearrange samples. It seems farfetched, but I'd rather suspend some disbelief than deal with the knowledge than such an idealistic guy could be so easily corrupted by the system he once seemed to fight against. Everything is wrong, indeed.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5348-18/,V2,2002.0,"When it comes to the world of electronic music, Moby is a name that needs no introduction. The man has been around for over two decades, crafting some of the most iconic electronic albums to ever grace the genre. However, with his 2018 album ""18"", Moby may have hit a bit of a slump. 

To begin with, let's talk about the history of the band. Moby first burst onto the scene in the early 1990s with his debut album ""Moby"". His unique blend of house, techno, and ambient music quickly gained him a dedicated following. Over the years, he has released numerous successful albums, with hits such as ""Porcelain"" and ""Natural Blues"" cementing his place in the electronic music pantheon. Thus, it's understandable that fans may have been eager to hear what Moby had in store with ""18"".

As for the creation story of the album, it's worth noting that the recording process was a bit different than Moby's usual approach. Rather than crafting the album in the traditional sense, Moby wrote songs over a two-year period, and then curated them into what would become ""18"". This approach is both a strength and a weakness for the album. On the one hand, it allows for a sense of cohesion throughout the album. The tracks transition well from one to the next and there's a sense of purpose to the album as a whole. On the other hand, it also feels like there's a lack of experimentation and risk-taking.

Now, for the personal experience and opinions. I have to say, ""18"" was not what I was expecting. As a fan of Moby's previous work, I was disappointed to find that the album fell short of my expectations. While it does have its moments, such as the euphoric ""We Are All Made Of Stars"", the majority of the album feels uninspired and lackluster. The songs are too formulaic and predictable, and the beats and production feel dated. It's not that the album is bad per se, but it's definitely not up to par with Moby's previous output.

All in all, ""18"" is a passable album that has its moments, but ultimately falls short. While it's not the worst electronic album out there, it's also not one that I would recommend to someone looking for an introduction to Moby's work. Fans of the artist may find something to enjoy here, but for everyone else, there are better options out there.","1.

Young Thug,Beautiful Thugger Girls,Rap,8.0,June 20 2017,Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,"Maybe Young Thug is supposed to be caught in a loop, arguing with Lyor Cohen over his recording habits and whether he has to sit politely next to Jimmy Fallon twice a year. Since “Stoner” hit in 2014, Thug has seemed like an ascendent star. But aside from “Best Friend,” which yielded him a Platinum plaque, and “Pick Up the Phone,” which might have been lifted out from under him anyway, Thug has yet to truly break through to the A-list. His only entries into the Top 40 have been the Rich Gang single “Lifestyle” and guest spots on Usher and Rae Sremmurd songs. His three records from 2016 all got kind, if muted, receptions and generally failed to move the chains much at all. For all the breathless adulation, the last eighteen months of Thug’s career have been like Groundhog Day for people to whom Travis Scott owes royalties. Beautiful Thugger Girls, released with little ceremony last Friday, wouldn’t appear at first glance to be the blockbuster that can change all of this. It came out the same day as 2 Chainz’s album, and Future’s HNDRXX, which is Thugger Girls’ closest recent analogue, has mostly vanished from the zeitgeist, unless a new summer single reveals itself. Nevertheless, this is Thug’s clearest step forward since 2015’s Barter 6, and perhaps his most compelling experiment in pop. As far back as his formative I Came From Nothing mixtapes, Thug’s music has bent toward chaos, even formlessness. What made Barter 6 so surprising to longtime fans and newcomers alike was how precise and restrained it was. Thugger Girls has all of that record’s control, but swaps out the subtlety for bleeding declarations of love and fidelity. The emotional stakes here seem impossibly high. It also applies the type of focus used on last year’s JEFFERY, where each song aimed to embody the voice of a titular influence. Instead of loosely connected, compelling fragments, each track was self-contained and had a distinct tone. That naming device is gone, but more often than not, the cuts on Thugger Girls work as single-song exercises. Though it’s been referred to by Thug himself as his “singing album,” Thugger Girls is not a radical departure for him, stylistically speaking. As with most of his material between Barter 6 and now, the question seems to be less what Thug is writing and recording at the given time and more what he’s decided to curate from the archives. Some of these songs date back to 2015 and have been teased on Snapchat and Instagram for nearly as long, and almost all of them have prototypes from earlier in his career. But these songs are more developed, even when “developed” means reduced to the core elements. The climax of Thugger Girls comes with Thug staring at a screen “masturbating to your nudes” and by the time you get to that moment on the record, it seems like the only possible conclusion. Rather than dress up his basest, most deeply-felt emotions, Thug lays himself out in the rawest form possible. But just as Barter 6 succeeded by paring Thug down to his most minimal, Thugger Girls strips away all the clutter, leaving his best-developed melodies and most evocative songwriting to date. The clarity doesn’t come right away. The opening tracks, “Family Don’t Matter” and “Tomorrow Til Infinity” play like a brooding, half-sober prelude. Thugger Girls really opens up on its third song, “She Wanna Party,” an exuberant cut co-produced by Rex Kudo, the architect of Post Malone’s “White Iverson.” Where “Iverson” was washed out and wistful, “Party” is unrestrained joy. The same could be said about “Do U Love Me,” where Thug dangles Benzes and Rolexes and hundred-dollar bills, but reserves most of his excitement for his clipped, repeated pleas: “Do you love me?” Those two songs are split by “Daddy’s Birthday,” a co-production by London On Da Track and the somehow still-producing Scott Storch. Thug pauses for a beat and considers the toll of his career: “I’m so busy, make me feel like I’m in and out my kids’ lives.” This is an underrated aspect of Thug’s songwriting—whether he’s adhering to a bigger concept or mumbling an aside, he goes for compact, declarative phrases that carry all the emotional weight for him. (From Rich Gang’s “Freestyle”: “I ain’t never been in love, I don’t know how pain feels.”) When he says, on “For Y’all,” “I didn’t write this song, I just went right in,” it’s difficult not to take him at his word. If the A-side feels like a bachelor party planned by Sun Ra, the B-side is more minimal. “On Fire” and “Get High” are tightly wound, the latter blessed by a superb Snoop Dogg verse where he deploys a handful of different flows and calls Young Thug “cuz.” “Me or Us” and “You Said” are what Rebirth could have been if Rebirth wasn’t Rebirth. And “Oh Yeah” sounds like a futuristic funeral dirge; at one point Thug says he’s “drunk off your love, and I just stood by the sink.” We’re used to seeing Thug in motion: leaving thousands of dollars in taxis, crudely repurposing limousine curtains, L-E-A-N-I-N-G. Seeing him rendered inert is entirely new. But speaking of Future, the elder Atlantan’s appearance on Thugger Girls might go the furthest in clarifying the headliner’s intent. On the hook for “Relationship,” Future says he’s “in a relationship with all my bitches,” which is more or less the conceit of the song, something each rapper can agree on. But Future, who’s eight years older than Thug, quickly adds a second thought: “I need to cut some of ‘em off, I need help.” This has been the thrust of his music for a while now, the drive toward hedonism and the emptiness it leaves you with. Thug’s not there yet; he’s peeling off gleefully mischievous lines like “I got your bitch in a backpack.” While he does pledge his undying love to his long-time girlfriend over and over again (and has throughout his catalog), at many moments on this record, Thug really does seem capable of being in a relationship with all of those women at once. Beautiful Thugger Girls is a twenty-something bouncing from club to yacht to attic and back again, feeling everything as deeply and as nakedly as possible along the way. These feelings, more often than not, are distinctly ephemeral, where time extends as far back as the Uber to the club and as far ahead as the Uber home. Unfiltered urges (“Fuck me, suck me”) rub right up against grand gestures (“Fall deep in love, love, love with me”). There’s little of Future’s jadedness. If in the past Thug has made everyday experiences seem chaotic and formless, his achievement here is distilling the murky waters of young love and lust into vital, undeniable pop.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/young-thug-beautiful-thugger-girls/,Atlantic,2017.0,"Young Thug's 'Beautiful Thugger Girls' is a rap album that seamlessly blends elements of R&B, trap, and pop. With an overall rating of 8 out of 10, this album is a true masterpiece that will be appreciated by fans of all genres. 

Born Jeffrey Lamar Williams, Young Thug started his music career by releasing a series of mixtapes that quickly garnered him a massive following. The Atlanta-based rapper is known for his unique vocal delivery that often includes sing-song melodies and unconventional rhyming patterns. 'Beautiful Thugger Girls' was released in 2017 and marked a departure from the rapper's usual style, as he traded his usual gritty lyrics for more tender ones, albeit still laced with a touch of rawness.

The album, at its core, is a love letter to the women who have impacted Young Thug's life, and he explores different aspects of relationships throughout. He sets the tone with the first track, ""Family Don’t Matter,"" featuring guest artist Millie Go Lightly, and delivers a hypnotic, melody-driven tune about a woman seeking her true love. “Do U Love Me” features a contagious chorus, where the rapper asks the question to his partner, questioning the intentions behind their love.

One of the most exciting aspects of this album is the extensive use of live instrumentation. The guitar-heavy tracks like ""Me Or Us"", and ""For Y'all,"" give a subtle nod to the classic R&B hits of the past, while still maintaining the rap genre's grit and attitude. The album features a number of guest artists, such as Gunna, Future, and Snoop Dogg, who all contribute to making the album a cohesive and well-rounded work of art. 

Personal favorite tracks include ""She Wanna Party"" featuring the legendary rapper Snoop Dogg, which has a funky groove and catchy chorus, and ""You Said,"" which is a duet with guest artist Quavo where they trade verses about dealing with a dishonest partner. 

In conclusion, Young Thug's 'Beautiful Thugger Girls' is an album that offers an impressive range of sounds and emotions, and it has helped to cement the rapper's lasting legacy. With its well-chosen beats and meaningful lyrics, it's easy to connect with these songs on a personal level. I highly recommend this album to anyone looking for a fresh take on the traditional rap genre.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed, including specific references to songs and production.

"Popol Vuh, Florian Fricke",Kailash,Electronic,7.3,March 16 2015,Nick Neyland,Contributor,"Florian Fricke's name doesn't often come up in discussions of great minimalist composers. The constraints of genre didn’t really suit him, and his best-known work was with German kosmische legends Popol Vuh, most notably in a series of soundtracks scored for Werner Herzog’s films. Kailash provides an introduction to the spare piano music Fricke worked on throughout his career, which was cut cruelly short by a stroke at age 57 in 2001. It’s been assembled by Soul Jazz, in a loving tribute: The first disc contains a mix of released and previously unreleased piano works, while the second contains a score to a documentary Fricke co-directed with his bandmate Frank Fiedler in the mountains of Tibet. This material edges closer to the metaphysical side of his output with Popol Vuh—a smart move that could hook in fans who haven’t ventured into his lesser-known works. A DVD of the documentary, also titled Kailash, rounds out the comprehensive package. The piano work here covers a considerable timespan, from 1972 to 1989. During these years, Fricke returned to the piano after years spent wandering various disciplines. According to David Stubbs’ krautrock book, Future Days, Fricke studied classical piano as a child, played jazz-fusion later in life, worked as a film critic, and had something resembling a spiritual epiphany when poring over old Mayan texts (one such text was the inspiration for the name P**opol Vuh). Fricke had something of an obsession with purity, both in a sacred and literal sense—the Moog synthesizer that was his trademark for a while was replaced by the piano for, in his words, its more ""human"" and ""direct"" feeling. If those quotes make Fricke sound like some kind of traditionalist, it was never a feeling conveyed in his otherworldly music. The soundtrack disc in this set contains many of the elements that became hallmarks in his work, including banks of foggy drones, reverberating cymbal splashes, and an air of dark rumination that conjures a decidedly inward-gazing spirituality. Fricke's soundtrack work stands on its own, apart from its visual stimulus, mostly because Fricke has a talent for imbuing his music with a strong sense of journey and place, making sure that contrasting ideas gently cascade into one another. There's a traceable arc from the prickly field recordings in ""The Garden Morya"" and ""Nomads Move"" to the gentle, wave-like structures of ""Last Village"" and the subtly creeping ""Valley of the Gods"". Fricke was clearly keen on reflecting both the light and dark side of his personality—something the Kailash soundtrack fully embodies. The leap from the Kailash score to the piano work is only a departure in the tools Fricke used. It’s not hard to see how his spare work informed the slightly more full sound of his music under the Popol Vuh name. The suite of three ""Spirit of Peace"" songs build around slowly repeating motifs and moments of near silence as notes gradually fade to grey, which is exactly how the best Popol Vuh tracks work, albeit with different instrumentals. Popol Vuh’s classic Hosianna Mantra (1972) prominently featured Fricke’s piano playing, and much of the material here resembles a version of his ideas from that album with a few layers stripped out. ""The Heart"" is the centerpiece of this set, with Fricke flickering between tranquility and a jagged edge, occasionally letting out an audible sigh, obviously lost in the circular shapes that engulf him in his art. The piano works make abundantly clear that Fricke was a musician with an exquisite ear for when not to play. He comes close to letting loose on the rippling mid-section of ""Moses"", but holds back, allowing the track its own painfully mournful exit. Both Julian Cope (in Krautrocksampler) and one-time Captain Beefheart sideman Gary Lucas (in a Wire epiphany) compared Fricke to John Cale, and it’s not hard to see why. They share a classically trained background, which they would try to escape from and embrace at various times in their careers. The positively jaunty (by Fricke’s standards) ""Garden of Pythagoras"" even resembles Cale’s piano playing on his and Lou Reed’s elegy for Andy Warhol, Songs for Drella—a record about love and loss and the wonder of formative experiences. Those big concepts are all over this album too, demonstrating how Fricke could summon them up with the lightest of gestures.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20242-kailash/,Soul Jazz,2015.0,"The ever-evolving and captivating world of electronic music brings us yet another stunning album with Popol Vuh's 'Kailash'. The electronic genre has always been about pushing boundaries and exploring new sounds, and this album is no different. With a rating of 7.3 out of 10, it’s clear that the band's ingenuity and creative spirit have been felt by their fans.

For those unfamiliar with Popol Vuh, the band's music has been synonymous with electronic and experimental music since they first emerged in the late 60s, led by the visionary artist and keyboardist, Florian Fricke. Fricke's journey into the world of electronic music was a deep and magical experience, leading him to explore the limits of the genre with experimentation, innovation, and creativity.

'Kailash' is a mesmerizing blend of ambient melodies, electronic beats, and intricate composition. The album is inspired by Fricke's spiritual journey to the mountain of Kailash in Tibet, an epicenter of Buddhist and Hindu religion. The mesmerizing sounds of the Himalayan terrain and the culture of Tibet are captured in the album, creating a unique listening experience for fans and newcomers alike.

The first track, 'Höre, Der Du Wagst,' introduces the listener to the album's theme with slowed-down chimes resonating over a heavenly melody, taking us slowly into a state of calm and introspection. This is followed by 'Haram Dei,' which starts with an ethereal beat that soon evolves into a series of intricate rhythms, leading to a truly unique electronic experience.

As the album progresses, the music becomes more minimalist and experimental, evoking the feeling of being in a trance. By the time the listener arrives at the closing track, 'Länglich,' the journey comes full circle, with the soundscape receding to a gentle, serene hum.

The album's inspiration of Fricke's pilgrimage to Kailash is so prominent in the music that one can almost feel the mountain's cold breeze and rugged terrain with every note played. The album's organic soundscapes and textures display a level of complexity rarely seen in the genre, making it a must-listen for lovers of electronic and experimental music.

Overall, Popol Vuh's 'Kailash' is an exceptional album that showcases the band's innovative spirit, taking the listener on a mesmerizing journey that stays with you long after the music fades away. If you're looking for an electronic album that pushes boundaries while staying true to its roots, then look no further than 'Kailash.'","Step 1: Review A mentions the name of the album, the artist, and some background information about the artist.

Temples,Sun Structures,Rock,5.5,February 12 2014,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"Noel Gallagher of Oasis, squinting recently at the bounteous musical landscape, dubbed the new Kettering-based quartet Temples ""the best new band in Britain."" If you've read anything about Temples, you've likely this already absorbed this fact. That is because—and forgive the bluntness—Noel Gallagher's endorsement is easily the most remarkable thing about Temples, who offer a studious recreation of psychedelic rock so devoid of an individual personality that the only way to discuss them is to check off the high-profile industry legends who have endorsed them and the legendary records they crib from. This sounds harsh and damning, but Sun Structures is not a bad album. Singer/bassist Thomas Warmsley and guitarist/vocalist James Bagshaw, the leading forces behind the group, come by their obsessions honestly, which, when it comes to influences, is the only thing that matters: They talk about their love of the Byrds, the Nazz, and Marc Bolan in interviews with intelligence and feeling, and Sun Structures reproduces the sounds of its era with a painstaking, granular attention to detail. If you were inclined, you could isolate every snare crack and background ""ahh"" and source it right back to a specific two-second snatch of a classic psych record. Which also points to why it's difficult to feel invested in Temples: This is pretty much all you can do with Sun Structures. There is nothing here to absorb about psychedelic music that Temples haven't already absorbed for you, and without imparting their own ideas. They are Tame Impala minus the sneaky modernizing touches, Foxygen sapped of irreverence. There are moments to admire on Sun Structures, but very little to remember and less to love: ""Shelter Song"" has pretty good chorus motion, in the way you might appreciate how two pieces of a modular shelving unit snap in place. ""Keep in the Dark"" is a good, strong T. Rex pop-rock tune, easily the most memorable four and a half minutes of Sun Structures' hour-long running time. And the keening, glassy guitar riff on ""Mesmerise"" is one of the few moments where Temples channel something close to actual euphoria. Euphoria  should always be a byproduct of good psychedelic music; if it's missing, you should check the dosage. Temples are phenomenally successful for a fledgling band. They've already notched opening slots for Suede, Kasabian, the Rolling Stones. Given their mastery of sound and the strength of their execution on Sun Structures, it's easy to imagine bigger successes in the future—awards-show slots, tribute shows, commercial syncs. But when you're operating within a strict template, you have to find some distinctive way to fill it out—a felicitous phrasing here, an unexpected chord change there. Without those elements, there's little on Sun Structures to remind you that you are, in fact, listening to a new band called Temples.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18955-temples-sun-structures/,Heavenly,2014.0,"At first glance, one may not be drawn in by a music album with a rating of 5.5 out of 10, but upon hearing ""Sun Structures"" by Temples, one cannot help but be impressed by the intricate nuances and musical craftsmanship on display. 

Temples, a British psychedelic rock band, burst onto the music scene in 2012 with their debut single ""Shelter Song,"" which garnered significant attention and led to the release of several EPs. The band's sound is heavily influenced by 60s rock bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, while also incorporating more contemporary elements.

Their debut album, ""Sun Structures,"" released in 2014, showcases the band's unique style and solidifies their place in the rock genre. The album was recorded at the band's home studio in Kettering, UK and was produced by James Bagshaw, the lead vocalist and guitarist of Temples.

From the very first track ""Shelter Song,"" one can hear the intricate guitar work and almost dream-like quality of the music. The use of vintage instruments like the Mellotron and Hammond organ adds to the psychedelic feel of the album. The second track, ""Sun Structures,"" showcases the band's impressive harmonizing abilities and perfectly encapsulates the album's overall tone.

Throughout the album, there are moments of pure musical bliss, such as the opening guitar riff on ""The Golden Throne,"" or the bass line on ""Colours to Life."" The band's influences are heavily present throughout the album, from the Rolling Stones-esque ""A Question Isn't Answered,"" to the Beatles-inspired ""Keep in the Dark."" However, the band manages to incorporate these influences while still maintaining their own unique sound.

As a fan of psychedelic rock, ""Sun Structures"" is an album that hits all the right notes. The production is fantastic, with every instrument clearly audible and perfectly balanced. The vocal harmonies are a standout feature, as they blend together seamlessly to create a cohesive sound. The only downside, in my opinion, is that at times the album can feel a bit repetitive and predictable.

Overall, ""Sun Structures"" by Temples is a solid addition to the psychedelic rock genre. While not necessarily groundbreaking, the album showcases the band's musical talents and keeps the listener engaged from start to finish. With their unique style and impressive musicianship, Temples is a band that is definitely worth exploring further.","1.

Let’s Eat Grandma,I’m All Ears,Pop/R&B,8.6,July 3 2018,Meaghan Garvey,Contributor,"In Let’s Eat Grandma’s vision of utopia, some days you might look like an alien; others, you wake up invisible. In a recent interview, the British duo—Jenny Hollingworth and Rosa Walton, both 19 and friends since kindergarten—wrestled with the limits of gender as identity. Life would make more sense, they suggested, if physical appearances warped constantly to represent one’s inner self. Rather than be a body, said Walton, “I wanna be a concept.” If you’ve existed as a teenager, you can probably relate; now imagine releasing an album of self-described “experimental sludge pop” as a pair of 16-year-olds dressed like haunted twin dolls. The response was predictable: adult critics shocked that teenage girls could make music at all, let alone music this trippy. That resistance to easy interpretation extends all the way to the name itself—which, granted, doesn’t exactly gesture towards virtuosity on first glance. “It’s a punctuation joke,” Hollingworth explained—an Eats, Shoots & Leaves type deal where one misplaced comma turns a dinner invite (“Let’s eat, Grandma!”) into a horror movie. But beyond an inside joke, the shape-shifting name embodies LEG’s creative ethos, slyly expanding on conventional notions of how music made by girls “should” sound. Their second album takes matters a step further. I’m All Ears doesn’t just defy demographic stereotypes—it sounds like nothing else in pop right now. I, Gemini, the duo’s 2016 debut, felt childlike in the sense that it was quite literally written by children; back then, Walton and Hollingworth’s helium-pitch voices gave the impression of cartoon mice, even as they sang about dead cats and radioactive mushrooms. Mileage may have varied depending on one’s tolerance for freak-folk or dadaist poetry, but clearly this wasn’t amateur hour. Guiding LEG’s voracious instrumental experiments (glockenspiels, recorders, motherfucking KAZOOS) was a sense of total control. If anything, I, Gemini’s everything-at-once psychedelia spoke directly to the feeling of being a young teenager—a kaleidoscope of unknowns, as terrifying as it is cool. Two years later, I’m All Ears delivers on its predecessor’s promise, and though its songs are coated with newfound gloss, they’re just as much of a trip. That much was clear from the first single, “Hot Pink”—a sighing, snarling pop banger, co-produced by SOPHIE alongside the Horrors’ Faris Badwan, that weaponizes the femininity that’s been leveled against the duo. “I’m just an object of disdain to you,” they sing jointly, their voices sickly sweet. “I’m only 17, I don’t know what you mean.” For a SOPHIE production, it’s relatively subdued, until the chorus shatters into sounds of breaking glass and failing machinery as the duo’s delivery bristles. “HOT PINK! Is it mine, is it?” they yelp, flipping the hue of drug-store lipstick and Barbie convertibles into a battle cry. The coexistence of hard and soft isn’t a study in contrasts but in synthesis, merging the two modes until you can’t tell where hard ends and soft begins. That song’s final chorus is interrupted by a phone call, the first of many moments on I’m All Ears where technology casts an uncanny glow. Pizzicato strings re-imagine a ringtone on the “Missed Call (1)” interlude, and “It’s Not Just Me”—a gently glitched-out synth-pop number, and the album’s second SOPHIE/Badwan production—includes a profoundly Gen Z farewell: “I don’t wanna say goodbye/I guess I’ll see you when the screen is vibrating.” Translating our virtual lives into compelling art is a challenge that often leaves me cold; how do you convey the humanity of a conversation carried out in text bubbles without sounding corny? But I’m All Ears renders flattened communication as poignant, striking not because of the novelty of being made by teenagers but because it speaks with such commanding precision to the experience of a teenager in 2018. In that sense, the album’s pop synthetics aren’t such a drastic departure from LEG’s previous work; they heighten the surreal feeling of paradigm-shifting emotional experiences that transpire on a screen in your hand. But despite the boldness of the production—uninhibited but never excessive, veering from Goblin-esque prog to pristine dance-pop to sludgy psych, sometimes in the same track—the album’s most mind-bending moments happen in Walton and Hollingworth’s writing. “Falling Into Me,” an ecstatic, street-lit roller-disco epic, opens with some of the most evocative lyrics I’ve heard all year: “I paved the backstreets with the mist of my brain/I crossed the gap between the platform and train.” (Amid all the headiness, three simple words later in the chorus—“You/Me/This”—are just as effective in describing the headrush of new romance.) And over the sullen guitar chords of “Cool & Collected,” LEG articulate the anxiety of feeling like a charmless nerd in front of your crush better than I’ve ever heard: “I still blur in the haze that you cut straight through.” Rather than get lost in these insecurities, LEG uses them as fuel, embracing uncertainty as a psychedelic experience in its own right. And where “Cool & Collected” wallows, album closer “Donnie Darko” practically levitates. Listless midsummer psych-pop climaxes into strobing, cerebral ’80s disco for the home stretch of the 11-plus minute suite; we are left with Walton and Hollingworth lying on the tile of their bathroom floor, heads spinning, drunk with emotion. I imagine the scene illuminated just like the video for “Hot Pink,” where phone screens and secret rooms beam with an irresistible glow, feminine and sinister and ultimately unresolved—the girls disappear into a bright pink room, and that’s the last we see. All of this reminds me that before it became known as the official shade of prescribed femininity, hot pink meant provocation. “Shocking pink” was introduced to the fashion world in the 1930s as the signature color of surrealist designer Elsa Schiaparelli, who collaborated with Salvador Dalí and, as a child, buried flower seeds in her nose and ears in an attempt to grow a garden on her face. Her designs were as weird as they were womanly, and shocking pink was no exception: “Bright, impossible, impudent, becoming, life-giving,” she once lovingly described it. You could say the same thing of Let’s Eat Grandma, whose bold, tender music at once captures teenage girlhood and transcends it entirely. I can’t imagine what they’ll do next.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lets-eat-grandma-im-all-ears/,Transgressive,2018.0,"Hey there, music enthusiasts! It's high time we talk about the amazing album 'I’m All Ears' by Let’s Eat Grandma. This pop/R&B masterpiece is everything you've been searching for in a modern album. I was immediately drawn to this album because of its unique band name and intriguing cover art, but let me tell you, it’s much more than just an album with a funky name.

Let's start with some background about the band. Let's Eat Grandma is made up of two best friends, Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth, who first met at the age of four! This talented duo hails from the UK, and their first album, 'I, Gemini' made quite the splash in the music world. But it’s their sophomore release, 'I’m All Ears,' that rightly deserves all the attention and love.

The creation story of 'I’m All Ears' is nothing short of remarkable. The album was produced by none other than David Wrench (who has worked with the likes of Frank Ocean and The xx). It was recorded in multiple locations, including a 500-year-old Norwegian wooden cabin! The band went through a year-long recording process, so it’s safe to say that they left no stone unturned when creating this masterpiece.

So, let's dive straight into the music. The album is filled with tracks that blend pop, R&B, and electronic music to create a sound that is both groovy and nostalgic. From the opening track ""Whitewater"" to the closing track ""Donnie Darko,"" the album consistently delivers dynamic and exciting tracks that keep you engrossed throughout. Personal favorites of mine include ""Hot Pink,"" ""Falling Into Me,"" and ""Snakes & Ladders.""

The vocals on this album are mesmerizing, with Rosa and Jenny’s voices harmonizing perfectly to create a sound that is both haunting and soothing. The production quality of the album is impressive and well-balanced, with each instrument being given its own moment to shine. The energetic beats of this album will make you want to dance, while the introspective lyrics will make you contemplate life.

In terms of personal experience, I have not been able to stop playing tracks from 'I’m All Ears' since I first heard them. This album is a masterpiece, and I truly believe it’s one of the best albums of the year. Each track is a journey, and the cohesion of the album as a whole makes it feel like one amazing experience.

In conclusion, 'I’m All Ears' by Let’s Eat Grandma is a pop/R&B album that you do not want to miss. It is an album that is both unique and accessible to any listener, with tracks that will stay with you long after you’ve finished listening. With a rating of 8.6 out of 10, it’s clear that this album is a must-listen for all music fans.","1.

Spoon,Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga,Rock,8.5,July 11 2007,Eric Harvey,Contributor,"Prior to the release of Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, online buzz suggested Spoon's sixth record was a grower, a distinction also conferred upon the Austin band's two previous albums, each more experimental (and at times alienating) than its predecessor. That optimistic adjective-- which incorporates both the listener's failure to quickly grasp a record as well as a hope to eventually do so-- feels exceedingly appropriate for Spoon, who have cultivated an intense fan base while continuing to experiment (the frequent comparisons to Wilco are indeed apt in this case). A large contingent of Spoon's following has come from Britt Daniel's continual knack for, as he sang on 1998's ""Metal Detektor"", making ""the sound of getting kicked when you're down."" If any song were to be the quintessential Spoon pop single, then, the radiant, Jon Brion-produced ""The Underdog"", a Cliff's Notes encapsulation of Spoon's earnest compassion for the fucked-over, is it. With a three-piece brass fanfare, ""Underdog"" is a battle cry against succumbing to mediocrity masquerading as a middle finger to the standard-bearers: The lyric ""Get free from the middle man"" could also read: ""Get free from the middle, man."" Likewise, the slinky ""Don't You Evah"" (a cover of an unreleased song by former tourmates the Natural History) affirms Spoon's trend toward emotional trusses for the fairer sex, recalling Gimme Fiction's ""They Never Got You"" and Kill the Moonlight's ""Don't Let It Get You Down"". A different directive occurs on opener ""Don't Make Me a Target"", however, which revisits the obscurantist personal politicizing that many thought marked *Fiction'*s ""My Mathematical Mind"". With a few well-chosen phrases-- ""Here come a man from the star...Beating his drum...Nuclear dicks with their dialect drawls,"" both victim and perpetrator become crystal clear. Ga Ga travels past in a flash-- at 36 minutes, it returns to the brief runtime that Fiction well surpassed-- but leaves plenty of reasons to revisit. Daniel and drummer Jim Eno's tendencies toward studio-based devilry come full-flower here, each listen revealing craftsmen reveling in detail. What in lesser hands could be extra-textual gobbledygook instead feels the product of studio freestyling, something to which the murky mixing-board wizardry of Jamaican dub is an obvious precursor. Penultimate song ""Finer Feelings"" is one bit of proof, its wide-open guitars-- straight from Sandinista!-- augmented with a sampled toast from (Clash collaborator) Mikey Dread's ""Industrial Spy"". With the addition of echoed ambiance from a Brussels fair field recording, ""Feelings"" acquires the aura of a surreal Kingston sound system. Earlier, ""Evah""'s introduction dips into the self-referentiality the band flirted with on Fiction, featuring a diced-up, looped Daniel asking Eno to record his studio talkback. Two songs later, all manner of discordance enters and exits the reverb-heavy mix of the appropriately titled ""Eddie's Ragga"", which developed from a jam session with Eddie Robert of Daniel-produced Austinites I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness. Ga Ga's most intriguing sonic creation, however, is the song which takes the dub influence in the furthest direction: ""The Ghost of You Lingers"". A return to Moonlight's spooky sonic variegation, ""Ghost""'s pounding, echoed piano feels like a merged memory of the jabbed guitar from ""Small Stakes"" with ""Paper Tiger""'s moody expressionism. Daniel's unmistakable voice is a distant, gothic wail here, as he mourns his missing love with characteristic jargon: ""We put on a clinic/ If you were here would you calm me down or settle the score."" Daniel's gift for non-mawkish romanticism results in both Ga Ga's best moments, and three of the best songs the band has yet create. Especially on Girls Can Tell, Spoon's always flirted with straight-up blue-eyed soul, and ""You Got Yr Cherry Bomb"" is their full-on take-off of Elvis Costello's Motown M.O. on Get Happy! (perhaps purposefully, then, the album's bonus disc is titled Get Nice!). Backed by an irresistible Holland-Dozier-Holland gospel-pop-stomp, ""Cherry Bomb"" re-imagines the heart/sleeve clichÃ© as a vivid bicep tattoo, as Daniel implores his love to three-point-turn and chill out. Ga Ga's real bang happens at its close, however, with the one-two send-off of ""Feelings"" and ""Black Like Me"". The former, which ostensibly documents a Memphis-based isolation, features a handclap-accompanied chorus as energized and unremittingly hopeful as Daniel's ever been: ""Sometimes I think that I'll find a love/ One that's gonna change my heart/ I'll find it in Commercial Appeal/ And then this heartache'll get chased away."" ""Black""'s melodic melancholy-- backed by a weeping piano/guitar motif that recalls Let it Bleed-- is simply gorgeous. Has Daniel ever written a lyric more crushing in its confused simplicity than ""I'm in need of someone to take care of me tonight""? Rather than attempt to relate with someone who's already taken leave, he splits, and so, apparently, does his mind. During the internalized call-and-response that follows, he appeals: ""All the weird kids up front/ Tell me what you know you want."" Thus, at the end of his emotional rope, he crosses the fourth wall and reveals the aching coda as a mutually lived performance. With Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, Spoon have once again found a gray area between the poles of pop accessibility and untested studio theorizing, modifying a formula that has grown to feel familiar even as it wanders, and refusing to square the circle while doing so. Through whatever process they use, the band has also managed to create yet another wonderfully singular indie rock record, unafraid of unfettered passion or self-sabotage, and which affirms a shrouded, hybrid style as unquestionably theirs. Perhaps it is fitting to refer to Ga Ga, and Spoon albums on the whole, as growers, then, but with a different definition: one that takes into account the bands continual, and continually rewarding, approach to creative maturation.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10390-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga/,Merge,2007.0,"Hey there, music lovers! Today, we're going to be diving into the world of indie rock with Spoon's 2007 album, ""Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga."" This album is a touchstone for those who are familiar with Spoon's music and a wonderful starting point for those who are new to this talented band.

Spoon has been around for quite some time, with their beginnings dating back to the early 90s. They're an American indie rock band from Austin, Texas, that's kept the music scene on notice for the last three decades. Their sound is entirely their own, with catchy hooks, sparse melodies, and a refined sense of style that sets them apart from the frenzied energy of other indie rock bands. In 2007, they released ""Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga,"" and it became an instant classic.

The album opens with ""Don't Make Me a Target,"" which sets the tone for the rest of the record. There's a slick, cool sophistication inherent in the band's sound, and this track is no exception. The instrumentation is tight, and the lyrics are catchy, a trend that continues throughout the album. One of the standout tracks, ""You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb,"" showcases fantastic lyrics, an infectious melody, and a killer guitar riff that's sure to have you nodding your head along to the beat.

The album's story differs from that of many other bands. Instead of being written on the road, ""Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga"" was born in a recording studio. Spoon booked a four-week session in a studio in New York and recorded the album all at once, giving it both a sense of cohesion and immediacy. And boy does it show! The album has a smooth flow to it, with each track seamlessly transitioning to the next.

As someone who's listened to this album numerous times, I can say that every song on this record has something to offer. The instrumentation is top-notch throughout, with intricate guitar riffs and beautiful drum work. Frontman Britt Daniel's voice is impressive as always, delivering emotional and poignant lyrics.

In my opinion, this album deserves its place in the pantheon of indie rock classics. Its catchy hooks and cool, sophisticated style are perfect ambassadors for the genre. It also shows that Spoon is a band that is blissfully confident in their music, having found their sound and being happy in it. Overall, if you're looking for fantastic indie rock, ""Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga"" is the album for you. It's an 8.5/10 for me, and it definitely deserves a spot in your music collection!","Review A is the human written review.

Maserati,Maserati VII,Rock,7.7,October 8 2012,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"In the Simpsons episode ""A Milhouse Divided"", Marge and Homer renew their vows. Homer's self-written vows include a series of ""sickness and in health"" dualities, one of which is ""in quiet solitude or blasting across the alkali flats in a jet-powered, monkey-navigated…"" Rev. Lovejoy doesn't finish the sentence, but you get the picture. And if you've ever wondered what it would feel like to blast across the alkali flats in a jet-powered, monkey-navigated something-or-other, Maserati VII gives you the chance to find out, if you play it at sufficient volume. Maserati have always been a band that mostly left the ""post"" out of ""post-rock."" Their sense of dynamics and compositional flow is right in line with Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky, and any number of other tension-and-release junkies, but the music never broods. Instead, it powers sleekly along on economical drumming, taut, delay-heavy riffs, and chugging bass, a little like Trans Am with more focus. The economical drumming is especially key, and Mike Albanese handles the kit well after taking over for the late Jerry Fuchs, who played with the band from 2005 to his death in 2009. At the very least, he was well-briefed on what makes this band's music so effective-- their rhythmic template seems to be a head-on crash between the tightly disciplined, unerring work of Kraftwerk's sequencers and drum machines and the looser, more human, but no less disciplined motorik beat of Neu!. The album's extended transcendent peak comes on right in the middle, with the 10-minute-plus blast that is ""Abracadabracab"". The Genesis reference in the title is intentional-- the beat plays off a similar sequenced rhythm to the ones Genesis used on Abacab-- and the song lives up to its own billing as modern-day prog rock with a groove. As it breaks down and builds back up, the band is always careful to keep pushing a forward motion. ""Solar Exodus"" is more explicitly electronic, layering Vocoder over buzzy electric sequencing, and a stomping funk beat. The band gets unusually heavy on ""Earth-Like"", but for the most part, their spiraling guitars help keep breakneck burners like ""The Eliminator"" light on their feet. VII pursues no radical new directions for Maserati, but even though you sort of already know these songs, they still have enough engaging motion and kinetic force that if you ever loved them in the first place, you'll love them all over again here. The moment ""San Angeles"" kicks in with and adrenalized surge of guitar and thudding club beat, it's easy to feel as though you're along for this whole ride. VII is pretty much the sonic equivalent of being in the passenger seat with Bullitt. It's fast and it's rough, and if you hold on, you'll probably enjoy it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17239-maserati-vii/,Temporary Residence,2012.0,"Maserati has been a hidden gem in the world of rock music for quite some time, and their seventh studio album, Maserati VII, truly exemplifies the talent and creativity that the band has been showcasing since their formation in 2001.

The album opens with the track ""San Angeles,"" which kicks off with a pulsating bassline and gradually builds into a high-energy, guitar-driven sound. This track sets the tone for the rest of the album, showcasing the band's ability to create catchy, yet intricate melodies that will make you want to get up and move.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Abracadabra,"" which features a fantastic combination of dreamy synthesizers, intricate guitar work, and driving drums that all come together to create a sound that is both ethereal and hard-hitting.

Another highlight on the album is ""Solar Exodus,"" which is a perfect example of the band's ability to take listeners on a musical journey. The track starts off with a slow, atmospheric buildup before launching into an explosive guitar solo that is sure to give you chills.

The creation story of this album is also fascinating. Maserati recorded most of the album in a remote cabin in the mountains of upstate New York, which definitely seems like the perfect setting for an album that is all about exploration and pushing boundaries.

One of the things that sets Maserati VII apart from other rock albums is the way in which it seamlessly blends different genres and sounds. From the dreamy synth-pop influences on ""Living Cell"" to the heavier, more aggressive sound on ""The Eliminator,"" Maserati VII has something for everyone.

Overall, I would highly recommend giving this album a listen if you are a fan of intricate, guitar-driven rock music. While it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate the unique sound and style that Maserati brings to the table will surely find something to love on Maserati VII. With a rating of 7.7 out of 10, it's clear that this album is well worth your time and attention.","1. Both reviews discuss the album Maserati VII by the band Maserati.

Danny Brown,Old,Rap,8.7,October 3 2013,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"Danny Brown's XXX was a concept album about desperation; ""If this shit don't work, nigga, I failed at life!"" he wailed on the opening song. Old is a concept album about existential confusion. Danny Brown has not failed at life—he's independently successful, with a fervent fan base both inside and out of rap. Now he's got to sort out how to best continue living. It might not be as dramatic a subject as flaming out, but it's more relatable to most of us, and it's maybe no accident that it resulted in the best and most resonant album of Brown's career. In preparing critics and fans, Brown went to great lengths to warn us not to expect another XXX—""If people are just looking for dick-sucking jokes, there isn't too many of them,"" he said back in January. ""I listened to Old every day and thought, ‘I need to make this more entertaining,"" he told Pitchfork later. When I ran into him at SXSW and introduced myself, he gave me a quizzical smile: ""I'm challenging ya'll with the next one,"" he joked, looking slightly uneasy. The irony of Old, of course, is that Danny Brown's version of a sober, measured, mature album still features plenty of lines about snorting crushed pills, throwing up in hotel sinks, and smoking so much kush you feel yourself falling off of the earth. Some things haven't changed. The album is divided into a ""Side A"" and a ""Side B,"" an act of aesthetic devotion that signals Danny Brown's unusual investment in the arcana of music fandom. Last year, he famously told a bewildered A$AP Rocky that one of his heroes was Arthur Lee before lecturing him on the merits of Forever Changes. The structure here suggests two LP sides, neatly divided, but one of the best things about Old is how mixed up it is—Brown's past, his present, his deranged side, his reflective side, his party songs and his nightmares. ""Problems in my past haunt my future and the present,"" he moans on ""Clean Up"". The album is 19 songs, ranging across so much emotional terrain that it almost needs to be tackled in stretches. Side A contains the heaviest, most harrowing material, but the demons he exorcises there don't stay put. Bad memories pop up everywhere on Old, including the louder, more festival-ready second half. The album's structure pokes at the notion of forward motion: At the end of the first track, an unrelentingly ugly crack-sale reminiscence taking place in an abandoned house in Detroit, A-Trak scratches in a hook from ""New Era"", a song off of Brown's 2010 release The Hybrid. An incident Brown alluded to on XXX's ""Fields""—""mommy gave me food stamps, told me buy some Wonderbread/ On the the way, these niggas jumped me, left with knots in my head""—gets expanded to song-length on ""Wonderbread"" and then referenced again at the end of the album. The cumulative message is layered: 1) Stop asking for the old Danny Brown, because I've been working double-time trying to escape him, and 2) Stop asking for the old Danny Brown, because he's obviously still here. There are multiple ""old Danny Browns,"" as well: There's the kid from ""Torture"", whose mind ""ticked off, desensitized to a lot of things"" after watching ""unk beatin on my auntie"" and a fiend ""damn near burn his top lip off."" There's the crack-dealer, who Brown is similarly eager to dispense with: ""This the last time I'mma tell it/ Wanna hear it? Here it go,"" he says on ""Side B,"" before launching into the details of his old trade. And there's the drug abuser, whom he catalogs unsparingly on ""Clean Up"", ignoring text messages from his daughter while he gets high in a hotel room. This is a complicated narrative to keep running but Brown is equal to the task. In his berserk originality, writerly flair, emotional impact, and old-fashioned craft, Danny Brown belongs in any conversation about the best rappers working, and he's at the top of his game here. His rapping is abrasive and visceral, but it's also musical, a quality he doesn't get much credit for because of his vocal tone. Listen to the way he rolls the word sounds ""fucked up"" and ""knuckles"" on ""Dubstep"" off of a perfect little woodpecker-stutter of percussion. Or his subdued performance on ""Lonely"" featuring a fluid, airy beat by Paul White built from two Morice Benin samples. The production is richly textured, unlikely, and surprising, solidifying Brown's left-field taste. He bends your ear back rapping over conventionally gritty hip-hop tracks from Oh No and Paul White and tackles a range of things that most rappers would run from, including the Rustie-produced electro-squelch ""Way Up Here"", a cluttered, frantic beat that feels expressly designed to trip rappers up. Ab-Soul and Brown muscle the octopus-armed thing to the ground. He barks over airhorn-shrill party anthems like ""Dip""and ""Handstand"" and broods conversationally on the Charli XCX-featuring ""Float On"". Brown has always made a compelling case for being weird, but he's never sounded this realized or confident in his weirdness before. ""Float On"", which closes the album, is an ""Elevators""-like lope, complete with woodblock knock, that finds Brown clearing away the static and bearing down on the only thing he's certain about: ""Nothing else matter except my next rhyme,"" he murmurs. Remembering a time when he had ""music in my heart, but my thoughts wouldn't listen,"" he prays to get old so that he can ""see my influence on this genre of music."" It's the humblest and most powerful wish I've heard on a record all year.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18565-danny-brown-old/,Fool's Gold,2013.0,"When Danny Brown dropped his highly anticipated album, ""Old"", rap fans everywhere knew it was time to pay attention. With a reputation as an uncompromising artist with a unique style, fans expected nothing less than a masterpiece from the Detroit rapper - and they weren't disappointed. 

If you've been following Danny Brown for a while, you'll know that he's not one to shy away from experimentation. His music can be dark, edgy, and packed with weird sounds and samples. ""Old"" takes things even further, blending rap with a variety of other genres to create a sound that's entirely his own.

The album tells a story of growth and self-reflection, with Danny Brown reflecting on his journey as a rapper and as a person. From the opening track, ""Side A (Old)"", we're taken on a journey through his mind, with lyrics that are as introspective as they are hard-hitting.

The album's production is nothing short of exceptional. The beats are innovative and leave plenty of room for Danny Brown to flex his skills as a lyricist. There are moments when the music feels almost minimalistic, with simple beats that are stripped back to allow his voice to shine through. And then there are tracks like ""Red 2 Go"", with its booming bass, that you can't help but move to.

One thing that sets Danny Brown apart from his peers is his unique voice. It's high-pitched and nasal, but somehow manages to remain commanding and powerful. Every track on ""Old"" showcases his ability to switch up his delivery, from the rapid-fire flow on ""Wonderbread"" to the more laid-back style on ""Clean Up"".

Personally, I was blown away by the album's standout track, ""25 Bucks"". Featuring guest vocals from Purity Ring's Megan James, it's a poignant exploration of poverty, addiction, and the pursuit of the American Dream. The haunting chorus of ""All I see is rain... drops on my window pane"" stuck with me for days after I first heard it.

Overall, ""Old"" is a high-quality album that deserves its place in any rap fan's collection. Danny Brown proves once again that he's one of the most influential and innovative rappers of our time, taking risks and pushing boundaries to create something truly unique. With powerful beats, insightful lyrics, and an unwavering commitment to his craft, ""Old"" is a must-listen for anyone who appreciates good music.","1.

The Dukes of Stratosphear,Chips from the Chocolate Fireball,Rock,9.0,January 10 2002,Jason Nickey,,"Sometime during the stone-grey early months of 1985, the members of XTC stumbled upon a time portal manifested in the form of a wardrobe in Captain Sensible's cobbled and thatched suburban London cottage. What the band was doing there no one can say, but as they stepped inside the portal, making their way past row after row of paisley frocks and multi-hued, four-in-hand ties, they were transported to the year 1967, emerging from the WC of a downtown go-go club. As luck would have it, the club's house band was absent that particular evening (all four had fallen ill with mononucleosis), so the lads in XTC had no trouble convincing management to allow them to take the stage. Having committed a fair share of the era's repertoire to memory, they (aided on drums by guitarist David Gregory's brother Ian, who happened to be with the band that fateful morn at the wardrobe) won the crowd over easily, and it wasn't long before they secured some studio time. Christening themselves the Dukes of Stratosphear, and renaming themselves individually as Sir John Johns (Partridge), the Red Curtain (Moulding), Lord Cornelius Plum (David Gregory), and E.I.E.I. Owen (Ian Gregory), the band whipped up an EP's and an LP's worth of dainty psychedelic pop songs, inspired like no other time in their careers. The Dukes were truly of their era, yet wholly XTC-- whimsical, bright, and trippy, but also wry, subtly sarcastic (even time travel couldn't change that), and sophisticated. It was as if they themselves were inventing the very band that would later inspire and influence their proper albums. Fortunately, before they were suddenly and unexpectedly jerked back to 1985 in the middle of a rehearsal, the Dukes had the foresight to hide their session tapes under a stack of Pat Boone records at a local shop, and there they remained until XTC could pick them back up during the Thatcher administration. The EP, 25 O'Clock, was released later that year, while the remaining ten tracks came out two years later on the Psonic Psunspot LP. Both were eventually collected in their entirety on Chips from the Chocolate Fireball, which has been recently reissued by Virgin. The above story must be what happened. What else could explain this prime, vintage psychedelia, released during the decidedly un-psych mid-1980s? What else could explain songs like ""Bike Ride to the Moon,"" with lines like, ""And we'll pack a tent 'cause it's cold at night/ And I'll share your sleeping bag if I might/ And might be a positive boon/ To protect you from the man in the moon""? (The Small Faces couldn't have put it better.) And how to explain the lack of much, if any, of the stench of 80s production values? You might think this is a pure joke project on the order of Spinal Tap's ""Listen to the Flower People,"" but play this album alongside, say, Pink Floyd's A Saucerful of Secrets or the Zombies' Odessey and Oracle, and you'll find that, parody or not, it's a great collection of songs that more than measures up. To put it bluntly, if you can only have one XTC album (by presidential mandate or something), this is the one. That's not a jab at XTC; they've delivered more than their fair share of outstanding releases in their day-- English Settlement and Skylarking, to name only two-- but there's always been a handful of mediocre songs on each album that could stay or go. Not here. All 16 are kaleidoscopic pop gems. It stands as a testament to the band's quirky genius that their loving parody/tribute side project just happens to be responsible for the best music they've ever made.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2475-chips-from-the-chocolate-fireball/,"Virgin,Virgin",1987.0,"If you are looking for an album that transports you back into the nostalgia of classic rock with vibrant, psychedelic sounds, look no further than ""Chips from the Chocolate Fireball"" by The Dukes of Stratosphear. This album is a true marvel that delivers on all fronts - from its obvious nod to the progressive rock era of the 60s and 70s to its modern sound that satisfies the expectations of today's discerning music lovers. With an impressive rating of 9.0 out of 10, it's safe to say that this album has captured the hearts of many music enthusiasts, and rightfully so.

Before diving into the album itself, a brief backstory of The Dukes of Stratosphear ought to be mentioned. Known as a side project of XTC, the band had emerged in the early 80s as a dedicated homage to the psychedelic rock of the 60s. This artistic endeavor was fueled by the musical passions of XTC's Andy Partridge, mastermind producer John Leckie, and Colin Moulding. The result was a brilliant album that exceeded all expectations.

The album's creation story also adds another layer of intrigue to the already alluring sounds: the album was recorded during XTC's own album sessions. Using the alias The Dukes of Stratosphear, they recorded the album under a veil of secrecy to not detract from the success of XTC. This level of effort and dedication is clear in the album's final product.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""25 O'Clock,"" which is an album opener that instantly captivates the listener with its upbeat, groovy sounds. It sets the tone for what is to come, which is a whirlwind of psychedelic sounds with an infectious energy that will keep your toes tapping throughout the album. ""What in the World??"" features head-bopping rhythms with groovy guitar strums that are sure to get you in the mood to dance. Meanwhile, ""Your Gold Dress"" has a dreamy, ethereal style that takes the listener on a journey through otherworldly sounds.

One of the key things that struck me with this album was the variety of sounds and creative risks the band took. Each track is distinct and unique, bringing something new to the table for the listener. It is a true testament to the band's musical prowess, and the result is an album that is stimulating, entertaining, and thought-provoking.

In conclusion, ""Chips from the Chocolate Fireball"" is a masterpiece that deserves a spot on your playlist, regardless of your musical preferences. Its psychedelic sounds will keep you entertained for hours, and it's a true reflection of the band's dedication to their craft. It's a reminder of the classic sounds of the past, coupled with modern twists that make it timeless. It's indeed an album that music lovers, old and new, need to experience.","1.

Moth Wranglers,Never Mind the Context,Folk/Country,7.3,September 17 2001,John Dark,,"Years ago, my family spread out to the rims of the country, like grease confronted with the cleaning power of Dawn. We didn't start out that way; we all, at one time or another (and for a brief moment, all at the same time), lived in Southwestern Pennsylvania. These days, however, the entire Dark brood are perimeter-dwellers: Boston, Florida, Houston, California. Overextended and mutually distant, we can barely coordinate a family get-together that doesn't involve a funeral, let alone produce a work of artistic merit like the Moth Wranglers' debut album, Never Mind the Context. But that's exactly how this bi-coastal collaborative project operates. The primary Wranglers, King Missile alum Chris Xefos and Flare's LD Beghtol, are graced by a mutual admiration society comprised of Camper Van Beethoven's Victor Krummenacher and Jonathan Segel, the Magnetic Fields' Stephin Merritt and Claudia Gonson, the Loud Family's Alison Faith Levy, the Posies' Ken Stringfellow, and the Geraldine Fibbers' Bill Tutton, among many, many others. A grand total of 29 contributors in all-- credited in egalitarian fashion with no mention of who played what-- even outnumbers my entire aforementioned extended family. A thousand attics and flea markets must have been raided to yield the album's menagerie of castaway ukuleles, autoharps, Marxophones, Aqualins and peck horns. But the songs are more traditional than their bizarro instrumentation would suggest, and all the musical toys are put to good use. Instantly, you're clued in that this won't be a normal listening experience. ""I Will Never Marry,"" a trad-Appalachian gospel-death ballad, sung a cappella, opens the album with a suitably ambivalent tone. The oddity of hearing Xefos and Beghtol deliver the line, ""I'll be no man's wife,"" in beautiful harmony is eerie and comical at the same time. From then on, they swap at lead vocals, with Beghtol's polished obsidian vox taking the lion's share. ""Turnabout"" is a screechy, Grange Hall dancin' ditty that recalls Camper Van Beethoven, and not only because it showcases the unmistakable and masterful fiddling of Jonathan Segel. The croony vocals telling the tale of British serial killer Denis Nilson in eyebrow-raising narrative also have that same California-freaky worldview: ""It's just a phase, perhaps a ruse/ It's nothing bad, he's just confused/ It's just a shame, it's just the truth/ No, nothing serious, call it youth."" Did I mention the hand-claps? ""Let Go, Let Me"" pits guest tormented-soul Stephin Merritt's deepest, most sonorous vocals yet against Tutton's contrabass (contrabass wins, but just barely). Beatlesque ""ooh-la-la-la's"" fill in the background along with soft bongos and a quivering vintage keyboard chord. The song positively slinks. Elsewhere, Belle and Sebastian are given a stylistic nod with the post-twee ballad, ""Yet Again."" Sing-songy strums, autoharp and a muddy-in-the-mix mandolin solo commingle behind a lilt that would make Morrissey's knees buckle. The album's not without its tedious moments, though. The moribund ""Six-Page Letter"" moves as if in slow motion. It reminded me of Nicole Kidman's excruciatingly drawn out speech patterns in Eyes Wide Shut. The song's lethargic melodies, bombarded with echoing distorted guitar effects, don't really go anywhere. And ""Record (She's Saving a Page)"" sounds like a bad marriage of third-rate prog and the Church. Such marriages inevitably end in divorce. But all told, the Moth Wranglers' idea of deconstructionist wackiness, folkie instrumentation and a sense of humor matched only by their sense of melody hits like a breath of fresh air in a dog kennel. From the overwrought Pink Floydian bombast of ""Don't Look Now"" to the European drinking hall singalong, ""Figure-Ground,"" the Moth Wranglers are all over the musical map. The result is cohesion sacrificed in the name of playful and insolent experimentation. And against odds, Xefos and Beghtol pull it off more often than not. The world needs more ideas like the Moth Wranglers: people who hold a wake instead of a funeral, who take drugs because the world doesn't seem normal without them, and who scribble moustaches on Mona Lisas.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5444-never-mind-the-context/,Magnetic Motorworks,2001.0,"Hey, music lovers! Today, I want to talk about an album that has really captured my attention lately. It's called ""Never Mind the Context"" by the Moth Wranglers. This band has been around for over a decade and has established themselves as experienced players in the Folk/Country genre.

Before we dive into the album itself, let's take a look at the backstory of the Moth Wranglers. They initially formed back in 2008 in Austin, Texas, a breeding ground for some of the best folk and country artists in the US. The band's name is derived from the idea of capturing and releasing moths that are drawn to the light at night. In the same way, they hope to capture and release audiences with their music.

This brings us to their latest album, ""Never Mind the Context."" The band describes it as their most ambitious project yet. The album is a collection of eight tracks, each showcasing the band's diverse musical influences, ranging from bluegrass to blues to honky-tonk.

When listening to this album, I was struck by how well-crafted each song was, both lyrically and musically. The lead vocals are rich and soulful, and the harmonies are spot on. ""Better Than Gold"" is a standout track with its infectious hook and lively instrumentation.

One of the things that I really appreciated about this album is that the Moth Wranglers don't shy away from tackling heavier themes. ""Texas Dust"" is a hauntingly beautiful song about the hardship of farming during droughts, and ""Siren Song"" explores the allure of addiction.

Personally, I found ""Never Mind the Context"" to be an authentic and compelling album. In a music world where so much seems to be bland and formulaic, the Moth Wranglers managed to create something truly unique. The diverse musical influences and thoughtful lyrics make this album a standout in the Folk/Country genre.

Overall, I would give ""Never Mind the Context"" a solid 7.3 out of 10. While the album might not appeal to everyone, I think any fan of quality music will appreciate the Moth Wranglers' dedication to their craft. So, light a candle, pour yourself a glass of whiskey, and give this album a listen. You won't regret it.","Step 1: Review A is longer and more descriptive, providing specific details about the band's background and the overall feel of the album.

The Herbaliser,Very Mercenary,"Electronic,Jazz,Pop/R&B",4.2,April 20 1999,Ryan Schreiber,Founder,"As a longtime admirer of Ninja Tune Records, I gotta say, they're slipping with this one. Admittledly, the Herbaliser's acclaimed 1997 release, Blow Your Headphones was pretty decent, but it was kinda crappy for a Ninja Tune record. The label's known for its innovation in clever electronic music that could sport a mild amount of humor and get away with it-- the artists were having a good time doing crazy shit with music, and that's what made it so great. Herbaliser, on the other hand, are a weed- obsessed rap duo whose only differing quality from mainstream rap acts is that their beats are a bit less sterile. But this isn't really great music. I mean, I've been stranded in Chicago without cable for two months, so I've been getting more than my fair share of new rap and R&B; on the Box, and this ain't shit compared to Missy Elliott's ""She a Bitch,"" Dru Hill's ""You are Everything,"" or even Jay-Z's ""Jigga What, Jigga Who."" When Very Mercenary isn't ripping off better rap and hip-hop acts, they're ripping off people like Ninja Tune founders Coldcut (""Wall Crawling Giant Insect Breaks"" is as direct a theft of Coldcut's ""More Beats and Pieces"" than you're ever likely to find), Jan Hammer (the production on ""Moon Sequence"" sounds suspiciously like Hammer's critically- lauded ""Theme from 'Miami Vice'""), or labelmate Neotropic (the musical backing for the album's closing track, ""Starlight,"" could have been pulled straight from Mr. Brubaker's Strawberry Alarm Clock). So, if you're considering picking something up off the Ninja Tune label, please, for your own sake, steer clear of the Herbaliser.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3830-very-mercenary/,"Ninja Tune,Ninja Tune",,"The Herbaliser's ""Very Mercenary"" is a stunningly crafted album, showcasing the band's ingenious ability to blend jazz, electronic and pop/R&B into one harmonious sound that is both unique and refreshing. From start to finish, this record is a fascinating journey through a wide range of musical styles, moods and themes.

But, before we dive into the music itself, let's briefly discuss the history of this talented band. The Herbaliser, comprised of Jake Wherry and Ollie Teeba, first formed in the early 1990s in London, United Kingdom. They quickly gained a reputation for their funky, instrumental hip-hop sound and landed a deal with Ninja Tune Records. From there, they have continued to evolve and experiment with various genres and collaborations, ultimately leading to the creation of ""Very Mercenary"" in 1999.

Their fourth studio album, ""Very Mercenary,"" is a product of the collaborative genius of Jake Wherry and Ollie Teeba, with contributions from a number of guest artists. The album's creation story is a fascinating one, and I couldn't help but be captivated by it. The duo drew inspiration from 1960s spy movies and classical library music, and combined this with their love for hip-hop and breaks to create an album that is truly one-of-a-kind. 

Now let's talk music. The 12 tracks on ""Very Mercenary"" are a sonic rollercoaster ride of various moods and styles. The moody opening song, ""The Missing Suitcase,"" sets the scene for the entire album with its brooding jazz beats and haunting vocals. This leads into ""Good Girl Gone Bad,"" a groovy and upbeat track that shows off the band's hip-hop roots. 

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""The Sensual Woman,"" a slow and seductive tune that features sultry vocals and has a distinctly loungey feel. Another standout is ""The Blend,"" which features a killer flute sample and showcases the band's ability to layer different sounds together seamlessly. 

While the album as a whole is undoubtedly impressive, there are a few moments that feel a bit lackluster. ""Another Mother"" and ""Geddim!"" fall a bit short in terms of memorable melodies and stand out themes. However, these moments are few and far between and do not detract from the overall experience.

My personal experience with ""Very Mercenary"" has been overwhelmingly positive. This album does an excellent job of keeping you engaged and interested throughout its 55 minute runtime. The best way I can describe it is that it's like a musical adventure - you never quite know what's coming next, but you're excited to find out.

In conclusion, ""Very Mercenary"" by The Herbaliser is a must-listen for any music lover who appreciates creativity, experimentation, and genre-bending. While there are a few moments that fall short, the majority of the album is a masterpiece that showcases the band's immense talent and passion for creating truly unique music. With its sophisticated blend of jazz, electronic and pop/R&B, this album is a timeless classic that will undoubtedly continue to inspire and intrigue for years to come.","1.

Glasvegas,Glasvegas,"Electronic,Rock",6.0,January 15 2009,Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,"Last year, the NME placed Vampire Weekend on its cover and declared that we were living in a time of renewed greatness in American music. Not long after, a blogger at The Guardian made essentially the same claim. Weirdly, the conventional wisdom for those of us on this side of the Atlantic was just the opposite, the line being that 2008 was a relatively ho-hum time for American indie rock. My suggestion for UK indie: It's not us, it's you. In the past few years, it's too few art school bands, too few mavericks, and too few iconoclasts; it's far too many groups that amount to a haircut, a worn copy of Is This It?, and a provincial accent. Above all, it's far too many bands that confuse ambition with chart placements instead of creativity. When Glasvegas first appeared a few years ago, they were trumpeted as an antidote to those problems and to bands like the Pigeon Detectives, the Enemy, and the View (don't worry-- you're not missing anything). They were a new template and a new set of influences (girl-group, JAMC and most any other band Alan McGee signed in the 1980s, Suicide, rockabilly). In short, a new hope. Their 2007 ""Daddy's Gone"" / ""Flowers & Football Tops"" single quite rightly got plenty of people excited: Guitar pop with balanced levels of breadth and depth, hooks to spare, singer James Allan's thick Scottish brogue, and even lyrics that are ""about something"" (absent father and early death, respectively). Cue fanfare. And then, like so many other post-Oasis bands, Glasvegas somehow became swept into UK guitar-rock's ""go big or go home"" mentality; they hooked up with Muse and Mars Volta producer Rich Costey and have turned out an album that's more Kasabian than vintage Creation. ""Flowers"" and ""Daddy's"" survived: The former kicks off the record and is still the band's best song to date, although now it takes almost 90 seconds to get going before it inexplicably closes with 90 seconds of ""You Are My Sunshine"". The bloat can't touch the awfully great four minutes in between but it's a worrying metaphor for the rest of the album: Perhaps the band was unsatisfied with or unconfident in what it had, perhaps it is equating scopes and importance with droney add-ons or non sequiturs but ""Flowers"" served as a glorious epitaph on its own without the grabs at additional heft. Another early song, former rockabilly-nicking ""I'm Gonna Get Stabbed"", has been renamed ""Stabbed"" and is now dominated by the melody to Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"". Most likely a reference to the Shangri-Las' awesome and heart-wrenching sexual abuse story ""Past, Present, and Future"", the addition of the classical piece here is awkward and cringe-worthy. And the record sort of goes on like that: It's a frustrating listen, with almost every track containing both a hint of something awesome alongside a clunky distraction. (To be fair, fans of brash arena rock will likely overlook the missteps and find a lot to love here.) ""Daddy's Gone"" survives mostly intact, a tantalizing reminder that the pre-release huzzahs heaped upon Glasvegas were not just well-intended but well-founded. Should-be single ""Polmont on My Mind"" and welcome musical switch-up ""Ice Cream Van"" are worthy additions to the band's catalog. Newer singles ""Geraldine"" and ""It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry"" come close to matching ""Daddy's"", but are again weighed down by their own ambitions and clumsy lyrics-- particularly the latter which actually includes the lines ""liar, liar, pants on fire."" No, really: That's the future of UK guitar rock. Here in America, we spent a lot of 2008, and now early 2009, celebrating a noise-pop underground that, in places, takes weak pop songs and slathers them with fuzz and reverb under the pretense of art. In this environment, it's great to see a band like Glasvegas go for it, take their own noise-pop impulses and shoot for the rafters. And yet, not only do they do it on almost every song, in almost the exact same way, but they seem to do just the opposite of the American brethren-- start with the fuzz and reverb, with quality noise-pop, then tack on layer after layer of gloss until their songs are transformed into modern rock. In their rush to be the UK's most important band, they seem to have ignored restraint, charisma, and charm-- the qualities that made them Next Big Thing candidates in the first place.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12597-glasvegas/,"Columbia,Columbia",,"For anyone looking for an album that seamlessly blends electronic and rock music, look no further than Glasvegas' self-titled release. With a 6.0 out of 10 rating, it may not seem like this album is a standout in the world of music, but after giving it a listen, it's clear that this Glasgow-based band has a lot to offer.

Glasvegas has been making music for well over a decade now, with some notable highlights including the release of their debut album, Glasvegas, in 2008. The group is known for their expansive sound, and this album is no exception. The electronic elements add depth and complexity to the otherwise rock-driven tracks, making for an interesting aural journey.

This album was created through a series of jam sessions between the band members, and it's evident in the tracks that there was a lot of experimentation and collaboration involved. The layers of sound are intricate, and the production quality is top-notch. 

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Youngblood"", which feels both nostalgic and modern at the same time. This track combines soaring vocals with a driving beat, and it's a perfect example of how Glasvegas can create something that's at once emotionally charged and musically innovative.

Another standout track is ""Dream Dream Dreaming"", which showcases the band's ability to craft a haunting melody that stays with you long after the track is over. It's a reflection on the nature of dreams and desires, and it's the perfect example of how Glasvegas can touch on universal themes in a way that's both personal and relatable.

Overall, this album manages to strike a balance between grit and beauty, and it's a testament to the band's prowess as musicians. While it may not be an instant classic, it's definitely worth a listen for anyone who appreciates music that's both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. If you're looking for an album that's sure to provoke some deep thoughts and feelings, then you should definitely give Glasvegas a listen.","1.

Joanna Newsom,Ys,Folk/Country,9.4,November 13 2006,Chris Dahlen,,"The biggest tragedy concerning Joanna Newsom's brave, marvelous new album, Ys, would be if everyone sat there listening to it like bored middle-school kids at an amateur Shakespeare production. Newsom's copious, knotty verse is far removed from that of the old poet, but its effect on the crowd is similar: Yes, it's hard to follow without the lyric sheet, it takes a few passes to catch the nuances, and all that drama can seem like something of a history lesson. Ys-- pronounced ""ees"" or if you prefer, ""yeesh""-- is free of the jolts and heads-up hooks we expect from pop music. But while it's sure to suffer accusations of empty self-indulgence from some, many will find the contrary truer: Ys offers an endless wealth of substance, teeming with dense, well-mapped beauty. Take one example: ""Monkey and Bear"". The song's title characters escape from the farm where they've lived safely all their lives, before one deviously cons the other into performing for frightened children in order to make a living. Listen to the greed the monkey conveys in degrading, insulting, and controlling the bear, and the tight grip he keeps on her dignity so as not to lose her-- which, of course, by the end, he does. Not bad for what starts out like a nursery rhyme. Newsom has said that all five of the songs on this 55-minute album tell true stories. But to find them, you'll wade through lines and lines of fantastic allegories and arcane references. Early listeners have latched onto the folky-druid overtones as an excuse to dismiss the record. But nobody's going to reject a record this bold just because Newsom uses the word ""thee"" on occasion, or because she appears in promotional photos wearing a wolf pelt ass-up on her head. What we really can't handle is escapism. We instinctively balk at artists who hunker down in their own worlds-- especially when they force us to guess what they're thinking. For someone who's been pegged as an ""outsider artist,"" Newsom chose a presentation that's defiantly decorous. Van Dyke Parks' orchestration is polite, never intruding on her performance. And her voice, though less shrieky and childlike than on The Milk-Eyed Mender, is still a tough read. The way she creaks, wavers, and punches the lyrics is expressive but never in an obvious way; rather than just illuminating the lyrics, she's almost sticking another code on top of them. But for all the exquisite melodies, arrangements, and production work, Newsom's lyrics make the performance. She crafts elaborate images but drives them with strong actions, and even the densest tangents keep pulling you along. An image like this one, from ""Emily""-- ""I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water
frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever,
in a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky'd been breathing on a mirror"" -- is beautiful in its own right, but it's also full of movement. Every line of the record conveys some want or desire. This is easy to hear on ""Only Skin"", the most modern (and Kate Bush-like) cut, where she describes ""being a woman""-- feeling fear, carrying candy like a mother, sharing her lover-- with language as vivid as she uses for a cloudy sky. Her eloquence starts to feel so natural that when she sings a line as blunt as, ""Stay with me for a while/ That's an awfully real gun""-- it sticks out like a rend in fabric. And the centerpiece, ""Sawdust and Diamonds"", comes closest to a full release: While the strings take a smoke break, she performs an exhilarating rhapsody where striking verbs-- ""cleft,"" ""shook,"" ""buckle,"" ""crash""-- support sweeping allusions to death, love, and fear. Her heart's racing, and she doesn't stop it. This isn't a great album because she owns a dog-eared encyclopedia, or because it stands above the cheap rewards or superficial freakiness we expected from her. It's great because Newsom confronts a mountain of conflicting feelings, and sifts through them for every nuance. It's intricate and crammed with information, but it's never bookish, and she never sits back in a spell and lets her heart flutter: She swoops into the sky and races across the ground, names every plant and every desire, and never feels less than real. The people who hear this record will split into two crowds: The ones who think it's silly and precious, and the ones who, once they hear it, won't be able to live without it.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9616-ys/,Drag City,2006.0,"Joanna Newsom's 'Ys' is nothing short of a masterpiece. This album represents the pinnacle of the Folk/Country genre, and it's no wonder it has a rating of 9.4 out of 10. As a fan of the genre, I was excited to dive into this album, and I couldn't be more impressed with what I heard.

First off, let's talk about the band's history. Joanna Newsom is a singer, songwriter, and harpist from Nevada City, California. She burst onto the scene in 2004 with her debut album, 'The Milk-Eyed Mender,' which received critical acclaim for its unique blend of folk, country, and indie music. With her sophomore album, 'Ys,' released in 2006, Newsom took her sound to new heights by enlisting the help of producer Jim O'Rourke and an all-star cast of musicians, including members of The Roots, Arcade Fire, and Smog. The result is a stunning collaboration that showcases Newsom's incredible talent and vision.

The album's creation story is just as impressive as its lineup. Newsom spent months writing and refining the songs on 'Ys,' using her harp as the foundation for each track. The songs represent a variety of emotions, from joy to heartache, and each one is a masterclass in storytelling. After recording the basic tracks in studio, Newsom brought in the aforementioned all-star cast to help flesh out the compositions, resulting in a dense, multilayered sound that rewards repeated listens.

Personal experience-wise, I couldn't be more enthusiastic about 'Ys.' As a longtime fan of the Folk/Country genre, I was immediately drawn in by Newsom's distinct, velvety voice and intricate harp playing. Each song on the album is a unique, self-contained work of art, and together they weave a rich tapestry of sound that's both complex and deeply emotional. It's rare to find an album that feels so complete, so thoughtfully constructed from start to finish.

Overall, Joanna Newsom's 'Ys' is a must-hear album for fans of the Folk/Country genre, and an essential addition to any music collection. Its complex arrangements, thoughtful lyrics, and stunning instrumentation make it a standout release in a crowded field, and I couldn't recommend it more highly. If you appreciate thoughtful, carefully crafted music that rewards close listening, do yourself a favor and check out 'Ys' today.","1.

David Rawlings,Poor David’s Almanack,Folk/Country,8.0,September 6 2017,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Poor David’s Almanack is David Rawlings’ third album or his eighth, depending on how you count. In the last 10 years, he’s made two records as the Dave Rawlings Machine, a loose reference to the old Woody Guthrie slogan, but he’s made five more with his musical partner Gillian Welch under her name. They both play on each other’s record, they both inform the direction each other’s music takes, but they maintain separate musical identities. Yet, their combined catalog comprises perhaps the most ambitious and most peculiar corpus in roots music today, one that digs deep into the past to find neglected song forms and defiantly old-timey notions: new ways of old singing, of just inhabiting the music. His latest is credited to just David Rawlings, but it features Welch and members of the Machine. He remains the most prominent personality on the album, and he’s a fine singer with a slightly nasal twang, a way of bleating his vowels that belies his New England origins. Listen to Rawlings dive into the chorus of “Lindsey Button,” drawing out each syllable: “A long time ago.” There’s a full decade in each word. He’s an even better guitar player, with a graceful picking style and a full bag of tricks. When he bends his notes on “Airplane,” he adds an earthbound dissonance to its airborne chorus. In his songwriting, Rawlings favors the repetition of the blues and the wily phrasing of folk. He rewrites the old tune “Cumberland Gap,” popularized by Guthrie and Lonnie Donegan, into a third-person tale of lost love and hard times. Rawlings, Welch, and the backing players use the same instruments available to any roots musician, but very little roots music sounds quite like this. That’s partly due to Rawlings’ production. He’s lent his touch to albums by Ryan Adams, Bright Eyes, and Dawes, and has a notoriously discriminating ear, to the extent that he and Welch are only just now releasing vinyl editions of their albums after 15 years of unsatisfactory test pressings. There’s a crisp intimacy to the record, but also a self-awareness. He and especially Welch were long dogged by criticisms of “inauthenticity,” which might have more to do with her L.A. origins, but they’ve managed to outlast them. Still, there is useful playacting to their music, as though they understand that any 21st century folk singer necessarily has some distance on their subject. Folk music has traditionally spoken to its present moment, addressing contemporaneous events and circumstances: murders and mining disasters, economic downturns and income inequality. So you might listen to Poor David’s Almanack and wish Rawlings had more to say about 2017. “Yup” is about a woman too strong-willed for the devil to keep in Hell; “Good God a Woman” is about Adam pestering his Creator to hurry up with Eve. They might hint toward contemporary feminist attitudes, but that’s a stretch—and perhaps Rawlings intends it to be a stretch. “Money Is the Meat in the Coconut,” with its carnivalesque tone and tale of monkeys getting married, sounds like an old political cartoon set to music, its inspiring calamity long forgotten even as the monkeys keep stealing kisses. Despite his obvious debts to Guthrie and Bob Dylan, Rawlings is no protest singer. His truest subject is not really the past—or, not merely the past. Rather, it’s the joy to be found in old songs, in old instruments, in old sounds, in old perspectives. Nearly every tune on Poor David’s Almanack has roots in something or someone specific. “Come on Over My House” is surely meant to echo Robert Johnson’s invitation in “Come on in My Kitchen,” recorded 80 years ago. Rawlings scrambles the scenario, speaking in the voice of a poor man in love with a woman above his station and repeating the refrain, “But I surely love you, surely love you!” Lusty but not leering, the song has a freewheeling pace, a bright and excitable tone grounded as much in the vocal harmonies as in the lyrics themselves. And that’s key to what distinguishes Rawlings from so many of his contemporaries: He manages to convey the same exuberance and spirit in his own music that he hears in his favorite old tunes.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-rawlings-poor-davids-almanack/,Acony,2017.0,"If there ever was an album that could properly assimilate the richness of Folk and Country music, it would be David Rawlings' 'Poor David’s Almanack'. With a solid 8.0 rating and an unmatched ability to blend the two genres, this album is a slow burn that grows on you, one song after another.

For those new to David Rawlings and his compadres, it is important to understand that Rawlings has been around for a very long time. As half of Dave Rawlings Machine, and long-time compadre of Gillian Welch, Rawlings has strong roots in American music that have been stretching back for decades. The beauty of his music lies in its ability to tap into the rich, deep vein of traditional folk sounds, while still remaining innovative and cutting-edge.

Every song on 'Poor David’s Almanack' is an introspection of some sort, whether it’s exploring the joys and tribulations of love, admiring the beauty of the world around us, or simply appreciating life's simpler pleasures. The stories are timeless, the lyrics are sharp, and the melodies are whimsical. The pace is at once contemplative and invigorating, slowing down and speeding up with just the right rhythm.

For those who love good storytelling, this album is your gold mine. Rawlings and his team weave intricate tales of life's surprises, from the up-tempo “Money is the Meat in the Coconut” to the more laid back “Come On Over My House”. Each song builds upon the album's themes of emotional vulnerability, resilience, and a deep appreciation for simple, beautiful moments.

The musicianship on 'Poor David’s Almanack' cannot be praised enough. With engaging mandolins, twanging guitars, and a steady percussion section, the instrumentation perfectly complements Rawlings' wistful lyrics. The album’s production quality is superb, with every note crisp and clear.

As a listener who's been enamored with Folk and Country music for a long time, I must say that 'Poor David’s Almanack' has been an eye-opener for me. It is refreshing to hear traditional sounds merged with new textures and techniques to create a work of art that is both modern and timeless. I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of quality craftsmanship, great storytelling, and beautiful melodies.

Purity Ring,another eternity,Electronic,6.6,March 2 2015,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"In early 2011, Purity Ring showed us the perfect balance for ""future pop"": Be ahead of your time, but not toofar ahead.""Belispeak"" and ""Ungirthed"" perfectly anticipated the reframing of indie pop as festival-ready ""Internet music"", and when Shrines came out, about a year later, the Edmonton duo saw their star rise alongside the similarly-minded polyglots like Grimes, kindred spirits who helped shift the sonic paradigm further away from guitars. But if pop listeners come for the songs, they tend to stay for the personalities, and this is the issue facing Purity Ring on another eternity. On their debut, Megan James and Corin Roddick were hard to read and analysis-averse, and they remain so. Their sound remains singular, but is it still interesting? Staying the course, as they largely do on another eternity, isn’t that risky a proposition for them: The pop world seems right about where Shrines left it. Accordingly, James and Roddick try to close the gap separating their vision of pop from actual pop. The bolder and brighter presentation of another eternity singles ""push pull"" and ""begin again"" gets them awfully close to latter-day Taylor Swift or Katy Perry; ""repetition"" could’ve popped up on If You’re Reading This It's Too Late or serve as a backing track for the next Miley Cyrus single, all acts whose 2013-2014 output drew liberally from Purity Ring. But if Purity Ring don't have the advantage of novelty anymore, their aesthetic is strong enough that familiarity becomes a decent substitute. Within the first minute of another eternity, the ease of recognizing Purity Ring amongst their still-growing brood of imitators is actually startling. If the lower-case stylization of another eternity and its song titles seems overly precious, at least it’s congruent with James’ distinct vocal approach. She works something like an origami expert, quickly folding and refolding melodies until they’re acutely angled, pointed, and elegant. James’ lyrics explore the same juxtaposition of delicacy and danger, though less so than on Shrines. She promised a more personal, present-tense perspective than her past work, and so her macabre, childlike fascination with bodily functions is applied to more adult situations, like breakups and such. At best, James’ impressionism leaves an imprint on your brain—on ""repetition"", the curious boast ""Watching me is like watching the fire take your eyes from you"" is delivered with enough gusto to hit at a gut level. However, by posting the lyrics sheet prior to the release of another eternity, the duo revealed as many ""o’ers"" and leering, stiff turns of phrase as a Decemberists album (""Baby why don’t you see my sea/ Get inside and build your castle into me""). At times, the moony metaphors devolve into Wordsworth Tumblr-jumble, and on ""stillness in woe"", James achieves a sort of Purity Ring singularity with one line: ""Meet me in the back shed/ I’ll be hanging up the knives/ Humming melodies that rhyme/ Building castles out of shovels."" It's this twee undercurrent that manages to keep Purity Ring nominally ""indie"", and also provides crucial contrast with Roddick’s productions. Roddick wants to remind listeners more of Mike WiLL Made It and Noah ""40"" Shebib than Burial and the Knife this time, and he makes everything sound more cushy and cavernous, evoking the sensation of sitting on the most comfortable couch in the club after everyone leaves. Throughout, Purity Ring manages to sound big without sounding expensive, forgoing nuance and detail for scalability. Stream it on laptop speakers and you can still picture every dazzling MIDI trigger in a live setting. James and Roddick altered their process for another eternity, working together in the same studio, and as a result they seem to have gravitated towards the sort of tricks meant to provoke an immediate, contagious enthusiasm from the person standing right next to you. Credit to Purity Ring for being honest with themselves and acknowledging that they’ve spent the past couple of years playing festivals and collaborating with the bigger names in oddball mainstream rap (Angel Haze, Danny Brown, Ab-Soul). The beats that pop up during the hooks of opening duo ""heartsigh"" and ""bodyache"" are meant for bleacher stomping, while there are legitimate ""Levels""-level drops on ""begin again"". Any sort of indignation feels misplaced—you might as well shake your fist at a rock song for containing a riff. But most of Roddick's ""new"" tricks could’ve ended up on Shrines, whether it's the apparitional, pitched-down vocals, flickering Auto-Tune, warped bass and a fairly brazen nick of Frank Ocean’s ""Thinkin Bout You"" on ""stranger than earth"". As a result, it's difficult to tell when another eternity builds on Shrines and when Shrines is being stripped for parts. By every objective standard, even the one set by its near-suffocatingly cohesive predecessor, this is a narrow work. Eight of its 1o tracks clock in between 3:15 and 3:40, and its tone, timbre, topicality and flow are pathologically even-keeled; there’s nothing to upset the equilibrium like Shrines' jarring Young Magic guest spot ""Grandloves"". Verses and choruses are pretty much equidistant at all times. You can imagine another eternity as beat-tape like source material, where just about every melody could be extracted for outside hook use. Perhaps we should’ve saw that coming considering the numerous allusions to repetition and new starts in both the album and song titles. But the most worrisome bit of referentiality comes not from Roddick's production or James' melodies, but from a recycling of Shrines’ most powerful image. That one came on ""Fineshrine"", where James experienced a love so overwhelming and frightening, she asked them to climb inside her rib cage. ""seacastle"" likewise views sexual congress as a supernatural escape plan and on ""repetition"" she echoes the favor from ""Fineshrine""—""Climb up in my rattling spine and I’ll contract."" This obsession with connecting and disappearing in rapid succession is fitting for a record that finds Purity Ring trying to stake their claim at pop's center but ultimately retreating within themselves.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20306-another-eternity/,4AD,2015.0,"Purity Ring's 'another eternity' is a mesmerizing electronic album that takes listeners on an ethereal and surreal auditory journey. Though the album has been given only a rating of 6.6 out of 10, it's my opinion that listeners who explore its depths will find something truly magical.

Purity Ring, a Canadian electronic music duo formed in 2010, consists of Megan James as the lead vocalist and Corin Roddick as the instrumentalist. Their distinctive style is a blend of surrealistic lyrics, ethereal vocals, and electronic music. This dichotomy between Megan's haunted vocals and Corin's pulsating beats has gained them quite a following, and their latest album - 'another eternity' - only proves why.

The album tells a story of love and longing, heartbreak and hope, and the desire to reclaim oneself. It takes us on a journey through the archetypal emotions that we all experience in our personal lives, but also embodies the strange, futuristic sound that we crave in contemporary music.

The album was created during a time when the band's two members were forced to work remotely from one another, thanks to the pandemic. As a result, it was recorded in bedrooms, basements and different studios in different cities. Despite these difficulties, the album comes together as a cohesive whole, and weaves together various sounds and themes to create an immersive listening experience.

The album's opening track, 'heartsigh', is electrifying and sets the tone for the rest of the album. Megan James' vocals are ethereal yet powerful, as Corin's beats kick in and drive the track forward. 'bodyache' is another standout track that showcases the duo's signature style. The song begins with Megan's haunting voice, singing about pain and the sound of a heartbeat that slowly fades, giving way to a sprawling soundscape of electronic beats and eerie synths.

One of my personal favorite tracks on the album is 'stranger than earth'. Megan's vocals are especially moving in this track as she sings about metamorphosis and the search for self-identity. The song's synth-lines and ambient electronic sounds are jittery and jittery and give the feeling of introspection and nervy excitement. Another stand-out track is 'push pull', where James' vocals are overlapping themselves, often creating an echo, giving a sense of otherworldly mysticism.

Overall, 'another eternity' by Purity Ring is an album that takes electronic sounds to new heights, offering a surreal and dreamy experience that is both moving and beautiful. Though some may argue the album's rating of 6.6 out of 10 is not reflective of the album's true quality, the uniqueness of the album may not be appreciated by everyone. However, this album is sure to be an unforgettable listening experience for anyone who is ready to explore the depths of electronic music beyond its surface level.",Review B,0.9186713634077246,Review B
Bonnie “Prince” Billy,Ask Forgiveness,Folk/Country,7.6,November 26 2007,Matt LeMay,Contributor,"At this point in his career, Will Oldham can do pretty much whatever he wants. Before reaching his 30th birthday, he'd already mastered Leonard Cohen-aping folk gloom (on Palace Brothers' Days in the Wake), Appalachian country-rock (on Palace Music's Viva Last Blues), and darkly grand balladry (on Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's I See a Darkness). But rather than continuing to reinvent himself, Oldham now seems to be resolving his dizzyingly multifold identity, shoring up the elements of his sound that have remained consistent throughout his career and subtly incorporating attributes of all of his past personas. If anything, this eight-song mini-LP (which consists of seven far-flung covers and one original) most closely recalls 1995's laidback and largely acoustic Hope EP, augmented with the female backing vocals and orchestral flourishes that mark his more recent work as Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy. The most striking thing about Ask Forgiveness is its consistency. While you used to be able to spot a trademark Oldham curveball (an unexpected ""fuck"" or ""dick,"" for example) from a mile away, his idiosyncrasies are increasingly being absorbed into the core of his approach, and no longer disrupt the continuity of his music. In a sense, it makes him less ostensibly interesting-- such ruptures are part of what made Oldham such an intriguing character in the first place-- but this turn toward unassuming directness is also making clear how singular Oldham is as an artist. What's both impressive and limiting about this release isn't so much the song selection, but rather the fact that every track is seamlessly rearranged to hit all the familiar Will Oldham notes. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Oldham's cover of ""I've Seen It All"", originally recorded as a duet between Björk and Thom Yorke for the former's Selmasongs. In Oldham's hands, the hypnotic and protracted melodicism of the original song is replaced with a straightforward rustic ambience. By minimizing the massive textural and dynamics shifts of Björk's version, Oldham places much more emphasis on the song's beautifully stark lyrics. The multi-part harmonies and subtle strings that Oldham deploys during the song's chorus add a gradual and understated ebb and flow, without even attempting to recreate the grandiosity of the original. Oldham's more conventional cover choices are no less successful. Mickey Newbury's ""I Came Here to Hear the Music"" opens Ask Forgiveness with impeccably arranged guitars and breathy female backing vocals. A cover of Phil Ochs' ""My Life"" shows Oldham imbuing his vocals with a subtle expressiveness that far exceeds the ""whiskey-soaked"" tone for which he's known. Even the most off-the-wall material (Danzig's ""Am I Demon"", R. Kelly's ""The World's Greatest"") come off as perfectly well-considered, totally free of awkwardness and/or cloying novelty. And the one Oldham original, ""I Loved the Streets"", is possibly the jauntiest tune here, unerringly concise and enjoyable. Discussing at length how each of Oldham's covers varies from the original doesn't quite capture the spirit of this release. Ask Forgiveness doesn't offer Oldham's ""take"" on well-known and well-loved songs so much as it showcases a unique and distinctive musician performing a scattered set of songs he enjoys. Which is the best we could hope for: an unlikely and understated release from an artist with absolutely nothing to prove.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10934-ask-forgiveness/,Drag City,2007.0,"Let me tell you about Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's latest album, Ask Forgiveness. First off, let's take a dive into this beloved band's history. Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy -- the moniker for singer-songwriter Will Oldham and his ever-evolving group of collaborators -- has been around since the early 1990s, and has been consistently praised for its unique blend of traditional Americana music with experimental tendencies. 

Now, let's talk about Ask Forgiveness. This album was released in 2018 and is a beautiful embodiment of Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's musical evolution. It sees the group exploring the intersections of country and folk music, while also incorporating more modern soundscapes in subtle but effective ways. 

One of the things I loved most about Ask Forgiveness is the way it balances upbeat and calming tracks perfectly. The album opens with ""Prince Alone In The Studio,"" a slow-burning ballad replete with harmonious guitar riffs and Will Oldham's signature deep vocals layered over lush instrumentals. Tracks like ""The Glow,"" on the other hand, showcase the band's ability to get you up and dancing with its folk-meets-rock sound. 

Another great thing about Ask Forgiveness is its lyrical depth. Oldham's writing is as poetic as ever, drawing you in with its vivid imagery and sharp insights into human relationships. The haunting ""Madeleine Mary"" is a perfect example, as it takes the listener on a journey through various mental states that are all too relatable. 

In my opinion, the standout track on this album is ""Blueberry Jam."" It features an upbeat rhythm, infectious chorus, and nostalgic lyrics that harken back to a simpler time. It's the kind of song that stays with you even after the album has ended. 

Overall, I would rate Ask Forgiveness at 7.6 out of 10. While not necessarily breaking any major sonic boundaries, it's a beautifully crafted album that showcases how a band can take the familiar and make it their own. If you're a fan of folk and country music with a modern twist, then this album is definitely worth a listen.","1.

Zola Jesus,Stridulum EP,Electronic,8.1,March 11 2010,Jason Crock,,"Zola Jesus didn't need to clean up to stand apart from the lo-fi horde-- they already had Nika Danilova's voice, which tends to cut through a track and leave an indelible impression no matter how it's recorded. Whether it's wordless yowling, an extended cover of ""Somebody to Love"", or something as disarming as The Spoils' ""Clay Bodies"", her singing has a way of sticking in your memory. Even so, the Stridulum EP represents a large stride forward, not just in production quality, but in the band's focus. Heard next to their gauzy beginnings, these six synth-driven tracks sound surprisingly clear, even poppy. Whether this cleaner sound is here to stay or not, the emotions behind the music are just as heavy, and this self-contained EP is the perfect place for the band to try something different. Danilova still belts out the lyrics from behind layers of cavernous reverb and the overall sound remains dramatic and foreboding. And though there are moments here where the foundation rumbles and the sound is disorienting, recording quality has nothing to do with it. Instead, Zola Jesus are more inclined to shake up the atmosphere with dissonance, like the whirring that disrupts the otherwise calming ""Trust Me"" or the ominous chamber-of-souls hissing at the end of ""Night"". Still, these hints of abstraction haunt the margins of more direct songs where hooky verses and memorable choruses are the norm. The tracks on Stridulum follow a pattern that opener ""Night"" nails at the start: They build from minimal but insistent beats and simple melodies into crescendos where the synthesizer tones, sampled incidental noise, and layered vocals merge into a stirring whole. Danilova leans on immediate, familiar phrases here: ""At the end of the night, we'll be together again""; ""When you're lost, know I'll be around""; ""It's not easy to fall in love""; ""I can't stand to see you this way"". The lyrics are visceral, and swooning chords and always-operatic vocals multiply the effect. Zola Jesus may be experimenting in more earnest and accessible pop here, but the charged theatrical mood is just as overwhelming. Zola Jesus' brooding, gothic vibe probably isn't going anywhere, nor is their willingness to experiment with the sonics and constraints of their songs. But Stridulum's immediately striking cover art hints at the depth of the band's ambition: Their personality is still here, but there's more thought in the composition and the presentation. So rather than cleaning up and getting ready for a close-up, the EP feels more like a lateral move, in the best possible way-- there's no guessing what comes next.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13987-stridulum-ep/,Sacred Bones,2010.0,"If you’re a fan of electronic music that pushes boundaries and takes risks, then you absolutely must check out Zola Jesus’ “Stridulum EP.” Released in 2010, this seven-track collection of haunting melodies and experimental beats is a standout in the electronic genre.

To dive into the history of Zola Jesus is to uncover a curious and eclectic artist who has been making her mark on the music scene since the age of sixteen. Born Natasha Khan, in 1989 in Phoenix, Arizona, she took on the moniker Zola Jesus and began creating avant-garde music. Her early work was primarily produced in the comfort of her bedroom with little knowledge of how to play instruments, let alone anything about music production.

The Stridulum EP came at a point of immense growth for Zola Jesus. Reflecting on the release, Khan notes that this project marked the beginnings of finding her footing as an artist, creating a sound that felt true to herself, and actively moving away from the influences of others; something that truly sets this album apart from other electronic offerings.

The EP’s sonic experimentation is evident from the opening track “Night.” Harsh, mechanical beats and ethereal voice textures weave together in a way that simulates a dance between two entirely different worlds. Much of the album balances these two extremes, never sacrificing one for the other. Each song creates its unique atmosphere, transporting the listener to a new dimension that’s both mesmerizing and unnerving.

One standout track is “Sea Talk,” which begins with a thumping bassline that quickly fades into a sparse, contemplative array of synths. The song progresses into an unrelenting wall of sound, courtesy of Khan's reverb-laden vocals and clever manipulation of electronic elements. It’s a masterful display of tension building and release.

Another highlight of the album is “I Can’t Stand.” With the layering of sounds that meld in almost seamlessly, Khan employs her voice to create a captivating chorus complete with otherworldly echoes. The lyricism is hauntingly beautiful, with lines like ""Emptiness is all I feel without you / And loneliness complete when you are here"". It’s a highlight of the EP that seems to float just as easily in the darkest of clubs as it would in a blissful, outdoorsy setting.

Ultimately, “Stridulum EP” is a testament to the power of electronic music to evoke emotion and move its listeners on a deep level. Zola Jesus’ unique and distinct flavor combines intense and seductive vocals, along with unique sounds that leave you yearning for more. The EP cements her as one of the most exciting and innovative artists in electronic music today. While its experimental nature may not be for everyone, this is a record for those who are willing to go on a journey through sound, to experience something unique and exciting that will leave an impact.

Kool A.D.,The Natural,Rap,6.7,January 10 2017,Matthew Strauss,Associate Editor,"In 2016,Victor Vazquez (aka Kool A.D.) released 10 albums, a staggering output that that rivals 2010s Gucci Mane or mid-’00s Lil Wayne. Across 282 tracks, he sang his own praises more than ever, maybe hoping to will his oft-repeated (however ironically and/or seriously) “best rapper in the world” claim into reality. Unfortunately, Vazquez was sometimes derailed by the actual music. Many songs and plenty of freestyles were lazily thrown together, likely by design. For example, “Arts & Leisure” (from July’s 100-song Zig Zag Zig) is just a pitched-up version of a 2012 Action Bronson collaboration. Vazquez’s final album of the year, The Natural, is also the best of the 10, setting aside his deconstructive tendencies in favor of structured songs with intriguing, clever, and funny rhymes. The project lives up to its title, showcasing a nonchalantly brilliant rapper. The Natural is cohesive, with all of the beats courtesy of frequent collaborator and fellow Bay Area resident Amaze 88. Sample-driven and blissed-out, the instrumentals keep the album moving when Vazquez threatens to drift off into the free-associative abyss. Leaning on his natural ability as the album’s concept, Vazquez sounds relaxed, effortlessly connecting thoughts. Nothing sounds forced, and he occasionally finds depth (“I feel the need to transmit my intellect along with the folly of my pride”) and humor (“the Scritti Politti scrivener”). He loves repeating himself, whether it is his own lyrics or those of others, and he may be realizing that if he wants to continue using his own bars over again in various songs, he needs to come up with some new signature phrases. Vazquez often buries insight in his lyrics to equalize the ordinary with the profound: All thoughts are valued on a Kool A.D. album. The Natural continues the trend, as he juxtaposes a line like, “Live for the common good of people, not capital” (“The Natural”), with a later one on “Lay Up” where he intentionally mispronounces “library” and brags about oral sex. It flattens the scope of rap, insisting that words are inherently meaningful and meaningless, and lines are just combinations of sounds and musings. Or, as he raps on “Fatwa”: “I speak with no notion of convincing you of anything.” It’s an impulse that both pushes forward and undermines Vazquez’s work: He understands the art form conceptually possibly like no other, and his continued output demonstrates a near-addiction to rap, but too often it serves as an excuse to deliver inferior product that works only theoretically.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22751-the-natural/,Self-released,2016.0,"Greetings, fellow music lovers! Today, I want to share my thoughts on the latest album by Kool A.D. called 'The Natural'. This rap album has been rated 6.7 out of 10, but, as we all know, music is subjective and rating it only serves as a starting point for discussion. So, let me tell you what I think of it.

First, let's talk about Kool A.D. for a moment. Prior to his solo career, he was a member of the famous hip-hop collective Das Racist, known for their irreverent lyrics and catchy beats. With 'The Natural', Kool A.D. showcases his solo work, which is a departure from his previous material. This album was created during a tumultuous time in his life, as he dealt with personal struggles and political turmoil. He poured all of his emotions into this album, and you can hear the rawness and honesty in every track.

'The Natural' has a unique sound that blends traditional hip-hop with experimental beats and alternative rock influences. The production quality is top-notch, with each track boasting a crisp and clear sound. Kool A.D.'s flow is smooth and effortless, and his lyrics are both witty and thought-provoking. He covers a wide range of topics, from social justice and politics to personal introspection and relationships.

One of the standout tracks on the album is 'Prove It', an upbeat number with a catchy hook that will surely get stuck in your head. Kool A.D. showcases his unique vocal style and clever wordplay in this track, making it an instant crowd-pleaser. Another great track is 'Insane Computer Raps', which features a heavy bassline and trippy beats that perfectly complement Kool A.D.'s flow. The lyrics on this track delve into themes of mental health and technology, making it an interesting and timely addition to the album.

Overall, I think 'The Natural' is a solid album that showcases Kool A.D.'s growth as an artist. While it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate experimental hip-hop and thought-provoking lyrics will find a lot to love in this album. I must admit, I was not familiar with Kool A.D.'s solo work prior to this album, but now I am excited to see where he goes from here.

In conclusion, 'The Natural' is a testament to the power of music to express raw emotion and connect people from all walks of life.

Gorky's Zygotic Mynci,Sleep/Holiday,Rock,6.8,October 19 2003,Scott Plagenhoef,,"Between billy goats and the Bambino there's been a lot of talk about curses and the cursed in recent weeks. The idea that misfortune specifically follows some isn't limited to pro sports: Theater has the Macbeth curse, Hollywood has the curse of Superman, and politics has the curse of the Kennedys. In music, Screamin' Jay Hawkins put a spell on you, Bark Psychosis produced one frequently brilliant Hex, and we've learned that incanting the alarmingly un-PC ""Ooo eee/ Ooo ah ah/ Ting tang/ Walla walla bing bang"" was the way to win a woman's heart, but the closest there's been to any sort of supposed curse is the one claimed to follow ""Helter Skelter"". One band that could qualify as, at the very least, extremely unlucky is Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, who have the misfortune of holding the record for charting the most singles in the UK without reaching the top 40 (eight through this October). Gorky's just missed the mark by a few spots on three occasions and although, yeah, crashing it at #37 and dropping out the next week didn't make bands like Northern Uproar or Geneva household names, it couldn't have hurt for Gorky's to have gained the wide exposure that comes with breaking the seal of the top 40, and therefore appearing on the UK's nationally broadcast Official Chart Show and having the possibility of performing on Top of the Pops. On the cusp of breaking through, Gorky's retreated from spotlight seeking, major labels, and the whimsical psychedelia of their past. (Highlights of the first half of the band's career was compiled earlier this year on 20). The result has reaped some of their richest works-- Spanish Dance Troupe, The Blue Trees, and How I Long to Feel That Summer-- which together make a enchanting second act in the life of one of the most quietly satisfying bands of the past decade. On Sleep/Holiday, Gorky's continue to explore delicate pastoralisms (piano and violin are increasingly pronounced and serve as the foundation of much of the band's sound), albeit with slightly more mixed results than usual. Though still often warm and tender, Sleep/Holiday lacks the surprise or the diversity of some of their better work, and their one attempt to reconcile that (the single ""Mow the Lawn"") is stunted and forced, lacking the playful brisk smiles of previous rave-ups such as ""Spanish Dance Troupe"" or ""Poodle Rockin'"". It's an anomaly, however, and not indicative of why or how this record-- too much of which drifts along making a lovely sound without really sticking its hooks in you-- falls short of the band's other recent efforts,. A couple of those moodier pieces (the reflective waltz ""Single to Fairwater"" and the droning, hymnal ""Pretty as a Bee"") work, but too often songs pass without incident or interest. When things go right, Gorky's still make a positively lovely sound, particularly the gorgeous, plaintive opening pair, ""Happiness"" and ""Waking for Winter"", each of which-- along with the jaunty ""Eyes of Green, Green, Green""-- seems to chase and cast off the ghosts that haunted Gorky's on previous albums. The former is a soul-searching song about willing good things to happen to oneself after pain. On the latter, singer Euros Childs no longer longs for summer but becomes animated by the winter cold. After the sense of tangible, deep loss of Spanish Dance Troupe and the desire for warmth and comfort on their two subsequent records, Gorky's conjures a very autumnal sound and a long-rejected willingness to accept pain, cursed luck, and changes for the worst. Childs braces for winter in his recollections of former lovers, the departed, and missed opportunities. As the title indicates, he still harbors hopes for escape-- into dreams, to the south of France, to the country-- but those desires seem, and sound, overwhelmed by feelings of exhaustion.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3531-sleepholiday/,Sanctuary,2003.0,"If you're a fan of melodic rock with a dash of whimsy, you won't be disappointed with Gorky's Zygotic Mynci's Sleep/Holiday. This Welsh outfit has a cult following, thanks to their unique blend of pop, folk, and prog rock elements.

Let's start with the band's history. Gorky's Zygotic Mynci formed in the late 1980s when the founding members were just teenagers. Over the years, they recorded several albums, toured extensively, and gained the respect of fellow musicians and critics alike. Despite never achieving mainstream success, their idiosyncratic style and diverse influences earned them a devoted fanbase.

Now, let's talk about Sleep/Holiday, their 2000 release. The album features eleven tracks, and it's hard to categorize them into a single genre. From the jaunty opener ""Where Does Yer Go Now?"" to the ethereal closer ""Body Itches,"" Sleep/Holiday showcases the band's versatility and willingness to experiment.

There are plenty of standout tracks on this album. ""Cursed, Coined and Crucified"" is a catchy tune that features infectious harmonies and bold guitar riffs. ""Can Megan"" is a slower, dreamier track that relies on acoustic guitar and piano to create a haunting melody. ""Let Those Blue Skies"" is a bouncy, fun track that channels the band's pop sensibilities.

However, Sleep/Holiday isn't perfect. Some of the tracks, like ""Dyle Fi"" and ""Rhiannon,"" feel like filler material, and they don't leave a lasting impression. Additionally, the production quality could be better in places, as some of the vocals and instruments sound muddled and distant.

Overall, I'd rate Sleep/Holiday a 6.8 out of 10. While it's not Gorky's Zygotic Mynci's best album, it's still a solid effort that showcases the band's strengths. If you're a fan of indie rock that's both melodic and quirky, Sleep/Holiday is definitely worth a listen.","1. Review A discusses the band's history, including their previous charting performance.

Marumari,Supermogadon,Electronic,7.8,September 27 2001,Matt LeMay,Contributor,"To this day, technology still has yet to approach an accurate approximation of nature. High-end CGI animations may elicit ""ooh's"" and ""aah's"" from us now, but in a few years, we're going to look back at something like the Final Fantasy movie and just laugh, the same way we currently laugh at an outdated special effects extravaganza like King Kong. Still, there's something oddly cool and impressive about a movie like King Kong, or even a more recent laughable special effects wankathon like Starship Troopers. It seems to be woven into the fabric of the human mind to be impressed, or at least entertained, by any kind of artificial reality that is at all analogous to our own. This principle extends perfectly into the realm of electronic music, where the quest for new and interesting sounds and the quest to electronically emulate organic sounds intermingle with concurrently fascinating and wildly entertaining results. Good electronic music provides the excitement of hearing a sound that you've possibly never heard before, and the fun of being able to try to figure out what that sound's sources was. Supermogadon, the latest album from Josh Presseisen under his Marumari alias, wonderfully captures the intriguing synthetic faÃ§ade of sci-fi. But whereas its predecessor, The Wolves Hollow, was oftentimes outright cheesy and cartoonish, Supermogadon is much more subtle and subdued. The Wolves Hollow drew its inspiration from a fictitious story of Plutonian wolves and cow brains; Supermogadon draws its inspiration from Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, converting chapter titles to song titles and co-opting cover art. Like The Wolves Hollow before it, Supermogadon takes a wonderfully warped approach to the futuristically fake. Barely audible vocal tracks are buried beneath drum machine beats and bubbly synthesizers. ""Indigo Florist,"" the album's standout track, layers synthesized bells with staticky drum machines and bouncy bass synthesizer. The song retains a relatively constant feel as new elements are added and removed, making for a subtle, gradual development. Sure, it doesn't necessarily reach through your headphones into your ears and violently shake its contents like a British nanny, but it certainly captivates when given proper attention. Another highlight comes with ""The Mutated Wisdom,"" a song that harbors many more twists and turns than most of the tracks on Supermogadon. A dissonant chorus of voice-like keyboards, a popping IDM beat, and sine wave synthesizers construct a clearly-defined rhythmic and melodic skeleton. Digitally manipulated squeaks scurry over the song like extraterrestrial rodents as a smooth drum machine beat shifts the track's rhythmic focus. At the end, everything fades out except for a distant echo of a synthesizer, which also quickly disappears. Indeed, distance seems to be a sonic theme of Supermogadon. Most of the melodies on the album are obscured and faded-- a drop in aural resolution that causes many of the sounds on the album to bleed together into a far-off, semi-terrestrial sonic landscape. Occasionally, the very prominent drum machines seem a bit forced or obvious, only distracting from the intricacy of the more obscured melodic workings. Rather than making the subtle sounds seem more accessible, oftentimes the drum machine beats on Supermogadon have the opposite effect, contrasting the other sounds too harshly to let them shine through. I'll concede that I've never read The Martian Chronicles. Nor have I seen the 1980 USA Miniseries adaptation with Bernadette Peters and Rock Hudson. But from what I've heard of Bradbury's classic, the sense of obscured unreality found on Supermogadon makes perfect sense. Using music instead of language, Pressiesen can convey this feeling in an instant, rather than fifty pages. Like a book, though, Supermogadon demands a significant portion of your attention to be fully appreciated.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5125-supermogadon/,Carpark,2001.0,"If you are looking for an album that takes you on an electronic journey, ""Supermogadon"" by Marumari is the one to listen to.

Marumari is an electronic music artist known for crafting a unique sound with his synthesis of various electronic genres. This album, released back in 2003, showcases his impeccable ability to blend sounds and make music that feels futuristic and, at the same time, nostalgic. He manages to create this mood by using soundscapes that take the listener on a journey, painting pictures in the listener's mind.

The album is a journey from start to finish, and it's clear that Marumari didn't just throw the tracks together, hoping they'd mesh. Instead, each track flows into the other seamlessly, creating a cohesive sonic landscape.

The opening track, ""Way in,"" immediately sets the mood for the rest of the album with its gentle, pensive melody. It's the track that grabs your attention and pulls you in. From there, the album only gets better, with tracks like ""North of the Boredom,"" which highlights Marumari's ability to create hypnotic beats.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Supermogadon,"" the title track. The track is the perfect combination of melody and beats, with its catchy melody, driving rhythm, and surreal sound effects. Another notable track is ""Magius,"" which features a spooky, haunting melody with a dark and eerie atmosphere.

Overall, Supermogadon is a fantastic electronic album with a lot of heart and soul. It's evident that Marumari put a lot of care and attention into crafting each track. This album isn't just a collection of songs, it's a cohesive album that tells a story.

If you're a fan of electronic music, or if you're just looking for something new and interesting to listen to, I highly recommend giving ""Supermogadon"" a spin. It's an album that deserves to be heard by as many people as possible.","Step 1: Both reviews focus on the same album, ""Supermogadon"" by Marumari.

Step 2: Review A uses more elaborate language and has a more complex sentence structure. For example, it uses phrases like ""intricacy of the more obscured melodic workings"" and ""fake. Barely audible vocal tracks are buried,"" whereas Review B uses simpler language like ""hypnotic beats"" and ""surreal sound effects.""

Step 3: Review A mentions specific songs and explores their sounds and structure. It also compares the album to the book, ""The Martian Chronicles."" Review B gives a broader overview of the album and its overall mood.

Step 4: Review A uses more literary devices, like metaphors and personification. For example, ""Like a book, though, Supermogadon demands a significant portion of your attention to be fully appreciated."" Review B uses simpler language and doesn't rely as heavily on literary devices.

Step 5: Based on the above observations, it is likely that Review B is the human written review. It is more straightforward and concise, focusing on the main elements of the album without getting too bogged down in detail or complexity. Meanwhile, Review A is likely generated by a machine or AI program due to its use of more elaborate language and complex sentence structure.",0.8883802639221023,Review B
John Lennon,Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon,Rock,8.0,October 5 2005,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"The legend of John Lennon, stripped bare of its romantic and willfully misinformed tales of idealism and near-religious fervor for ""changing the world,"" is mostly a lot of short stories about a stubborn, quick-witted domestic hero. Working class? That's debatable, as is much of Lennon's life for everyone save his widow and second son-- but then all good stories have an air of mystery about them. If I were more cynical, I'd point out that one person's mystery is another's propaganda, but ultimately, Lennon is going to be remembered for songs, not his personal life. Of course his personal life was his songs; to a fault, Lennon wrote about what he knew, however skewed by bitterness, confusion, regret, braggadocio, or even peace and love. Consequently, it's difficult to hear Lennon's post-Beatles music beyond the frame of whatever commotion was going on in his world at the time. Be it bed-ins for peace, trouble with Immigration, various political rants, relationship highs and woes, or his undying love of old rock and roll, Lennon was as partial as the most insular blogger-- and with no pretense of linking his sources. But then, he was probably smarter than anyone he knew (again, save Yoko Ono), and you can hardly blame a generation of spiritual hangers-on for letting his idiosyncrasies and tantrums run rampant. He wasn't the first punk; he wasn't ever really a hippie; he wasn't a poet, exactly, and he was barely a guitarist. He was a middle-class boomer with a short fuse, overtly provocative social and political ideals, but who was uncut for anything besides making music. Lennon's music, as a window into his life, is serviceable. As pop, it's immediately distinctive, if frustrating and inconsistent. As something in lieu of new Beatles albums, it's mostly disappointing. But as Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon makes abundantly clear over the span of two CDs, it was also a pretty amazing document of a mature artist going through the same shit as everyone else does. No, I don't recall asking for another Lennon comp, but as I get older, and we all get further from the circumstances that made him an icon, I'm reminded that his insight into growing up and getting on with life (and any number of distractions) was as keen as anyone's. Collections like this generally serve to rewrite history more often than give representative pictures of reality, but even Lennon's best moments are rife with contradiction and awkward expression. The good news is that Working Class Hero really does include most of his best stuff: ""Imagine"", ""Instant Karma"", ""(Just Like) Starting Over"", and ""Give Peace a Chance"" are obligated to any Lennon best-of, but Ono and Capitol were pretty spot-on by including ace stuff like ""Gimme Some Truth"", ""Jealous Guy"", ""#9 Dream"" and a fantastic ""Real Love"" demo-- not to mention most of Plastic Ono Band. In truth, had this set also included the acerbic, Paul-hating ""How Do You Sleep?"" from Imagine, I could've recommended it over any of his solo records save POB. Yet again, Lennon is inconsistent to the end. As for rarities, beyond ""Real Love"", there is a live version of ""Come Together"" (wherein Lennon warns the crowd they may know more of the words than he does-- and then proves it), but Working Class Hero is supposed to be ""definitive,"" not all-inclusive. The Double Fantasy-era songs-- ""(Just Like) Starting Over"", ""Watching the Wheels"", ""Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)"", ""Woman"", ""Losing You"", and the Milk and Honey single ""Nobody Told Me""-- stand out from the rest as being a bit slick and out of steam, though in all fairness, also seem far less bitter than, say, ""Mind Games"". Again, it's all part of the legend that comes crumbling down when you actually listen to the songs-- his ""greatest hits"" suggest a guy who, while overcoming some of his darkest demons, was still a long way from being comfortable with himself even as he was living in the lap of luxury. The buttoned-up, proto-adult-contemporary sheen of Double Fantasy seems like a big slap in the face to real, live marital friction-- certainly about as far a cry as one could get from the uber-stark performances on ""God"" or ""Working Class Hero"". Pundits might argue that as Lennon matured as an artist, he felt less need to be musically confrontational. I would argue back that I'm a long way from relating to adult contemporary sheen. As a collection, Working Class Hero succeeds: The single-disc Lennon Legend always seemed reductive to me, and there's no way I need the four discs of solo Lennon available on the Anthology box set. Better still, this really does give me most of the stuff I'd want to put in my Lennon mp3 folder, and at this point, that's about as good a recommendation as I can give a compilation-- at least until the next one comes around in a couple of years. And what was that about instant karma...",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4733-working-class-hero-the-definitive-lennon/,Capitol,2005.0,"Let's talk about John Lennon, shall we?

Willard Grant Conspiracy,Regard the End,Folk/Country,3.9,March 8 2004,Neil Robertson,,"Have you ever wondered whether alt-country is representing its electorate? All these sorry tales of murder, blood-spilt love and the dead cow skulls scattered by gravel roads have become so synonymous with the music of the Midwest and the songs of the South, that it becomes easy to lose perspective. Are the likes of Houston and Omaha really the barren, backwards dustbowl towns you hear of in songs? Are there no people who wear suits, drive foreign cars, sip lattés and read the New York Times while making snide remarks about Bush? Yes, of course there are. So why doesn't the music ever reflect that? The Willard Grant Conspiracy is another clichéd country band, another bunch of blues-ridden, fire-and-brimstone missionaries whose opaque, gothic hymnals add to the myth of Americana. They've never been great, even back to 1998's sort-of well regarded Flying Low, a record that, in retrospect, seems virtually identical to all their others. Now on their fifth record, the band has shown no signs of growth, and the fact that their core partnership of frontman Robert Foster and guitarist Paul Austin is augmented by an alumni of assorted waifs, strays and passers-by (including Kristin Hersh, and members of Lambchop and The Walkabouts) does nothing to alleviate the sameness of what is essentially another set of safe, formulaic ballads for the No Depression set. By all measures, Regard the End is a conventionally ""beautiful"" record. Robert Fisher's bass-tinged voice can stretch from meek and tender to intense and bellowing, with an aged wisdom that adds grace and gravity to tracks like the near-Celtic lament ""Beyond the Shore"". They've also got the knack for ""tasteful"" arrangements. On the pompously titled ""Ghost of the Girl in the Well"", guitars strum and shimmer in line with Foster's voice while a bored rhythm section reminds the band to stay awake. Strings sway, shiver, and flail helplessly, reaching for a heartstring to grab. Yet, for the most part, The Willard Grant Conspiracy are grabbing at thin air. On tracks like ""Rosalee"", you're stunned by the utterly formulaic approach to some of the songwriting. As an acoustic guitar sparks up its folksy strum, Foster dictates a tale of a girl that refuses to speak with all the melodic distinctiveness of a Dave Matthews tune, before a violin takes its cue, embellishing the song with some unnecessary attention-seeking. This cycle repeats itself for 3\xBD minutes before stumbling to a failed, idea-drained finish. And then there's the suffering-- lots of it, all over the album-- not all of which belongs to the bored-to-tears listener. On closing track ""The Suffering Song"", Foster moans about how ""mother's got a few days left/ She thinks it's time we all learnt to pray."" And as the song climbs to its climax, with the rousing chorus of ""suffering's going to come to everyone someday,"" you certainly get the sense that, well, he might be suffering a bit. But suffering from what? What infuriates most about this record is not its rigid predictability, its absence of invention or its reliance on tired-out alt-country clichés; it's the fact that throughout Regard the End, the songs rely on only the vaguest utterances of emotion, amounting to little more than a bad landscape painting-- all grand brushstrokes, no substance or detail. It seems that the band is fully competent of evoking a mood, but incapable of articulating why. Rarely has a genre sounded so tried and tired, so forced, formulaic and reliant on its own mythology as country music is made to sound on Regard the End. Though its application and musicianship is admirable, its lack of lyrical argument or narrative leave us with a canon of paceless funereal laments that conjure endless feelings of enforced sadness without explanation. In a field full of fellow lovesick souls, these are failings we simply shouldn't have to accept.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8686-regard-the-end/,Kimchee,2004.0,"Before Probing into my thoughts, it is decent to know more about the album ""Regard the End"" and the band Willard Grant Conspiracy. The band, a blend of folk and country, has remained in the industry for quite some time now, and over time they have honed their unique style. In their latest Album, Regard the End, this outfit presents an almost melancholic collection of tunes, comprised of some of their best works.

The album was put together during the lockdown due to the spread of the coronavirus in the year 2020, and at the time, the band, like many others, was grappling with uncertainties about the future. The songs on the album, in one way or another, explore the themes of finality, redemption, and mortality. Giving it a listen, one can tell that it is an album that was born out of those uncertain situations.

On the overall, the album does a fantastic job creating a unique atmosphere for listeners to immerse themselves in. With songs such as ""Debts"" and ""Sacred Heart"" that are indeed haunting, to the more joyful tunes like ""Trail's End,"" the Willard Grant Conspiracy has a vast range of emotions to offer. Even with the dynamic melodies, it seems like this outfit's strength lies more in the lyrics that tell a story about life, love, and everything else.

Having said that, the truth is that, despite the unique lyrics and the distinctive style, this is not an album for everybody. It is not the type of music that will play on every radio station, but it is certainly one that deserves attention from music enthusiasts, especially in the Folk genre.

In conclusion, Willard Grant Conspiracy's ""Regard the End"" is an album that possesses a sense of depth and poignancy that would appeal to lovers of the genre.

Jason: I really don't know why I'm here. Well, okay, I know why I'm here, but I don't think I have a problem. It's just that, ever since my band Jellyfish split up, I can't stay out of the studio. I keep making these songs and putting out these records, and then I wait, and wait, and wait. But they never come. Soundgarden's Chris Cornell: Who never comes? Jason: The people, man! The people never come. I don't know why. They just don't seem to know I'm here. I never went away, so why did the people go away? Miles Hunt (of the Wonder Stuff): Because they don't care. Trust me, friend, I played empty stinking clubs half of last year, and all I got was free beer. Jason: Yeah but... but... I'm special. People loved me when I was in Jellyfish. I mean, we didn't sell a lot of records, but the critics liked us. Living Colour's Corey Glover: Doesn't matter. Once you get rid of that band name, you're no better than shit on a horse's hooves. People don't care... nobody cares. Jason: Maybe not for you, Body Glove, but I'm different. I sound like a baritone Jeff Buckley. I know how to make pop songs that are both lush and longing.

For those who aren't familiar with him, Falkner is an exceptionally talented singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and music producer, who's been actively involved in the music industry for over 25 years. He's collaborated on numerous projects with some of the most famous names in the industry, including Beck, Air, and Paul McCartney.

This time around, Falkner brings us an interesting blend of Pop and R&B elements, which is certainly a departure from his usual alternative and power-pop genres. The album feels much more mature and polished than his previous work, indicating that he's fully committed to exploring new sonic textures and musical experimentation.

As for the album creation story, Falkner spent about two years writing and producing the ten tracks on 'Can You Still Feel', which he describes as ""emotional, powerful, and introspective"". The title of the album is quite suggestive and closely relates to the delicate nature of the songs. With his music, Falkner deals with complex feelings such as love, heartbreak, self-discovery, and the search for identity.

Personally, I think that this album has a uniquely seductive quality. The way the instruments and beats are arranged behind Falkner's silky-smooth voice just works perfectly. Each track is filled with such sweet emotion that it's hard not to get emotional yourself. One of my favorite tracks would have to be ""I Live"", which starts slow and builds up to a chorus that anyone could easily sing alongside Falkner.

In all honesty, the album takes some time to grow on you. It's not something that will instantly grab your attention, but that's okay because as it develops, it reveals a depth of musicianship and attention to detail that you can't help but admire. 

Overall, I think that 'Can You Still Feel' is an excellent addition to Falkner's discography. Undoubtedly, it's not his strongest album, but it still has a flavor of its own that's worth experiencing. Music lovers should prepare themselves for a ride of introspection, self-discovery, and super-smooth vocals. If you're looking for something fresh yet familiar, I would definitely recommend you give this album a listen.","1. Review A contains dialogue between multiple people, while Review B does not.

Shit Robot,From the Cradle to the Rave,Electronic,7.1,September 27 2010,Joe Colly,Contributor,"The title From the Cradle to the Rave suggests a lifetime's worth of dance music-- a kind of connoisseurship we've come to expect from the DFA label. In the case of Marcus Lambkin aka Shit Robot, that's just the education he's enjoyed: Now 39, the Irish-born producer started DJing in Dublin in the late 1980s before moving to New York in 1992 to absorb the acid house and disco bubbling up in the city's underground clubs. There he'd eventually link up with James Murphy and have a hand in creating DFA. Weirdly, though, this is Lambkin's debut full-length. The record features a host of high-profile collaborators-- Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor, Juan MacLean-- and is executive-produced by Murphy himself. This, in addition to Lambkin's history and pedigree, possibly gives From the Cradle to the Rave an inflated sense of promise-- it's the kind of record you almost expect to be good. But as with any debut, it's important to try to strip away some of those associations and see what's actually under the hood. On some level Lambkin's sound is classic DFA-- sturdy dance numbers augmented with vocals-- but stylistically he's more scattered than his peers, integrating not only disco but sounds from all across the house music spectrum. He's obviously got great taste, and his production skill is immediately clear-- there's a real mastery of space in these tracks, full of sound but never overcrowded. So these are all really good instrumentals, but Lambkin struggles a bit in turning them into something more. If LCD or Hot Chip are a clean genre hybrid, then this sometimes feels like club tracks with vocals added in after the fact. That's not always a bad thing-- occasionally you wind up with something that sounds like a cool vocal edit of an extended house jam, for instance. What usually tips the scales one way or the other here is the singer. ""Take 'Em Up"", for example, is steamy disco-funk, and guest vocalist Nancy Whang is a great fit-- her singing tends to be flat, but on this cut it's just the right contrast with the bouncy arrangement. The flip side is a song like ""Grim Receiver"", which is a killer acid-house instrumental that's ultimately spoiled by Juan MacLean's croaky talk-sing, or ""I Found Love"", where Lambkin lays a bizarre country-western vocal on an otherwise rad minimal-house thumper. There's of course something appealingly raw about classically not-good singing alongside crisp electronics, and bands like the Human League and LCD have shown how that can work. But especially with disco and house, a great vocal doesn't hurt and sometimes an instrumental is enough. Not surprisingly, the best cuts here are the ones like ""I Got a Feeling"" and ""Triumph!!!"" where Lambkin's able really to sprawl out and let his synths and beats do the talking. On these, it's easy to hear the decades of dance music this guy's absorbed and appreciate how he's able to spin that into sounds that are at once reverential and future-forward. This doesn't happen on every track, but when it does, it's something special.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14679-from-the-cradle-to-the-rave/,DFA,2010.0,"If you're a fan of electronic music, then you've probably heard of Shit Robot - the Irish DJ and producer behind some of the genre's most well-known tracks. From the Cradle to the Rave is his second studio album, and it's definitely one you don't want to miss.

Shit Robot, also known as Marcus Lambkin, has been in the music industry for over two decades. He started off as a DJ in New York City, working in some of the hottest clubs in the 1990s. It wasn't until 2004 that he put out his first EP, Wrong Galaxy. However, it was his 2010 debut album, From the Cradle to the Rave, that really put him on the map.

The album was inspired by Lambkin's move back to Dublin after living in New York for years. He wanted to create music that reflected his love for the techno and house scenes in both cities. What he ended up with was an album that perfectly captures the energy of a night out at the club.

From the Cradle to the Rave features collaborations with some of the biggest names in electronic music, including LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy and Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor. The first single, ""Tuff Enuff,"" is a perfect example of Lambkin's ability to create dance-worthy tracks with catchy beats and synths.

What sets this album apart from other electronic releases is the amount of emotion that Shit Robot inserts into each track. ""Losing My Patience"" is a standout song, with its soulful vocals and melancholic melodies. ""I Found Love"" is another emotional track, with its nostalgic lyrics about lost love and the desire to find it again.

But it's not all about the feels; From the Cradle to the Rave has plenty of upbeat tracks as well. ""Take 'Em Up"" is a fast-paced, disco-inspired number that will have you grooving on the dance floor. ""Answering Machine"" is another high-energy track that will definitely get your heart racing.

Overall, From the Cradle to the Rave is a solid album that showcases Shit Robot's talent as a producer. While some tracks are stronger than others, the album as a whole is cohesive and well-crafted.

Chuck Johnson,Balsams,Experimental,8.1,June 5 2017,Marc Masters,Contributor,"Pedal steel guitar is such an evocative instrument that just one chord emanating from its strings can suggest entire worlds. Often that’s exactly how it is used: one chord at a time, doled out sparingly to enhance moods already established by other instruments. But what if you give pedal steel guitar the starring role? That’s what Chuck Johnson does on Balsams, an album that’s drowning in waves of pedal steel, accompanied only by sparse, time-marking bass tones. It’s a simple formula, but Johnson mines it for rich music that feels infinitely expressive. This isn’t exactly a shock, given that Johnson was already pretty great at creating moods with a guitar. He’s made three previous albums of subtle finger-picked acoustic work, as well as a full-band effort—last year’s Velvet Arc—that used pedal steel more traditionally. But there’s something singular about what he’s done on Balsams. It feels like a universe unto itself, one where each slow, patient strain of pedal steel builds on the previous one. Individually, none of the album’s six tracks sounds very different from each other, but as a whole they create a three-dimensional sonic space that expands and evolves. In that sense, Balsams is more an ambient album than a folk-based guitar record. Think of it as country post-rock: Johnson’s hypnotic music conjures cinematic landscapes as strong as those evoked by Stars of the Lid or Flying Saucer Attack, but his guitar’s gentle twang sounds more like a desert with wafting tumbleweeds than a sky with drifting clouds. Whatever images the album might inspire, there is definitely a lot of weather happening in Balsams’ widescreen scenes. You can feel air moving, sand sifting, and sun baking as Johnson’s guitar chords gradually stretch across the horizon. In the album’s best moments, those chords regenerate and deepen, making it hard to tell where one sound begins and another ends. During “Riga Black,” guitar tones continually emerge and fade in overlapping circles; in “Moonstone,” rising chords spawn textures that trail each other. At times, Johnson’s sounds transcend standard associations with the pedal steel guitar, as on opener “Calamus,” whose long echoes resemble a bowed violin or a soaring synth as much as metal sliding across strings. Within this guitar-heavy environment, Johnson’s bass notes at first feel like afterthoughts, but they turn out to be crucial. Often they provide steps for the pedal steel to climb, their short durations propelling longer atmospherics that climb higher with each passing tone. This recalls the way Labradford often used simple notes to carve a path for grander tones, and Johnson proves just as adept at that move. His approach shines most vividly during “Labrodite Eye,” where the up-and-down crests of pedal steel are pulled by bass like gravity tugging at tides. It’s a supporting role, akin to the reassuring tick of a clock, but once you’ve let Balsams fully mesmerize you, it’s hard to imagine any of Johnson’s songs without that transfixing metronome. It seems that Johnson’s main goal here is to transfix—perhaps not just the listener but himself as well. It must have been tempting for him to swerve from his devout sonic path, adding a drumbeat hear or a voice there, or even just a three-note guitar solo somewhere. But part of the beauty of Balsams is that it entrances not in spite of its homogeneity, but because of it. In one sense, it’s an experiment to see what pedal steel guitar can do when it’s asked to do it all. But the results make Balsams more than that: a fully realized sonic world, and one worth visiting for a long time.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23275-chuck-johnson-balsams/,VDSQ,2017.0,"If one were to take a hike through the forest and listen closely to the sounds around them, they might hear something like Chuck Johnson's latest album, ""Balsams.""

""Balsams"" was created in a cabin in the woods of North Carolina, during a three-week residency at the Headlands Center for the Arts. Surrounded by nature and removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, Johnson had the freedom to experiment with ideas and push the boundaries of his creativity. It's no surprise that the resulting album is a transcendent meditation, inspired by the beauty of nature and the innate rhythms of the world around us.

Listening to ""Balsams"" is like taking a journey through an enchanted forest, as Johnson creates intricate layers of sound that blend together seamlessly, creating a sonic landscape that is both familiar and otherworldly. The album opens with ""Everything at Once,"" a track that perfectly captures the essence of the album, with its haunting melodies and hypnotic rhythms. As the album progresses, Johnson takes the listener on an emotional journey through a variety of moods and tones, from the mournful ""Corvid Tactics"" to the uplifting ""Riga Black.""

One of the things that sets ""Balsams"" apart from other experimental albums is the attention to detail that Johnson has put into each track. Every sound has been carefully crafted, and the subtle nuances and textures give the album a richness and depth that is hard to find in modern music. It's clear that Johnson has a deep respect for the craft of composition, and his meticulous approach shines through in every track.

As a music lover, I found ""Balsams"" to be an incredibly rewarding listening experience. There is something undeniably spiritual about this album, and I found myself getting lost in the beautiful and intricate melodies that Johnson has created. It's rare to find an album that is so thought-provoking and emotional, yet so easy to listen to, and ""Balsams"" is a true masterclass in experimental music.

In conclusion, ""Balsams"" is an album that I would recommend to anyone who appreciates the beauty of the natural world, or who is looking for something truly unique and inspiring in their music. Chuck Johnson has created a masterpiece with this album, and it's one that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. With ""Balsams,"" Johnson proves that there is still room for innovation and creativity in the world of music, and that the possibilities are truly endless.","1.

Hudson Mohawke,Lantern,Electronic,7.4,June 15 2015,Craig Jenkins,Contributor,"Over the last three years, Glaswegian producer Hudson Mohawke (born Ross Birchard) has made major headway infusing rap with new electronic textures both as one half of TNGHT with Canadian DJ Lunice and as a beatmaker in Kanye West’s G.O.O.D Music stable. But he doesn’t seem to want to be defined by his hip-hop dabbling anymore. Mohawke said as much in conversation with Pitchfork this spring, where he was reticent to even utter the word ""rap."" And so the guiding principle for Mohawke's sophomore album, Lantern, is to showcase his versatility. He’s been pecking away at the record since he got swept up into the Yeezus machine, and it feels like a conscious subversion of everything people might expect to hear from a guy with credits on Nothing Was the Same, My Name Is My Name, and I Am Not a Human Being II. For one, there aren’t any rappers on Lantern. It isn’t your typical producer's showcase, and our maestro doesn’t hide behind a parade of cleverly curated guest features. Only five of the album’s 14 songs bother with vocals at all, and the performers slide neatly into Hud Mo's vehicles, commanding attention as necessary but often hanging back in the mix, another paintbrush by the artist’s easel. Antony tiptoes around a napping lover on ""Indian Steps"", while Jhené Aiko mourns a doomed romance on ""Resistance"". Neither voice raises above a whisper as they bob gently over sparse, swirling arrangements. Lantern’s quieter tracks are broken up with moments of bedlam—Irfane’s helium-voiced lead on ""Very First Breath"" is the calming focal point in a disorienting array of bleating video game keys—and when it gets loud, the album's guest vocalists are terra firma underneath a pulverizing armada of synths. The album’s more ambitiously orchestrated sections are a rewarding new look for the producer. The widescreen majesty of ""Kettles"" and ""Scud Books"" fully realize a sound Mohawke hinted at years ago with cuts like ""Shower Melody"", off his 2009 Warp Records debut Butter. ""Kettles"" abandons the idea that Mohawke needs to make electronic music at all, opting for heart-swelling neoclassical instead, before ""Scud Books"" takes everything he tried on the previous song and crams it back into a trap cut. ""Lil Djembe"" picks up Eastern instruments and drops a conventional approach to melody for a two-and-a-half minute excursion that presents one of the few times here Mohawke’s ideas come off better on paper than in execution. Lantern’s risk-taking is daring and giddy, but its favored mode, and Hudson Mohawke’s best, is hooky, crowded, rap-conscious electropop. Lead single ""Ryderz"" employs an old trick from Mohawke’s benefactor Mr. West—overlaying a sped-up soul sample with syrupy embellishments —to heart-busting success. ""Shadows"" assembles an army of 8-bit synths, then runs them through a quick, showy drop for a cheap but mercenary thrill. The album’s closing stretch plays sneaky games with pace. ""Portrait of Luci""’s much-needed breather quickly proves to be a fake-out; ""System"" follows, combining manic keys and a pulsating, insistent kick drum for the album’s most conventionally clubby indulgence before ""Brand New World"" closes things out at half the speed, loud, ratty guitar in tow like an homage to the overdriven brat pop of Sleigh Bells. Hudson Mohawke became an EDM circuit sensation sort of by accident three years ago with the success of TNGHT, and he spent the year after that with his hand in a number of 2013’s biggest rap releases. But Lantern finds him wisely darting outside both scenes before anyone gets a chance to pigeonhole him. Scores of great producers settle quickly into an identifiable sound after a big break and proceed to churn out variations on the same song until the calls stop coming. But Mohawke’s puckish eagerness to try new things when the most eyes are trained on him suggests he’s thinking past his next move to the one after that. A less talented hand might’ve faltered juggling six different genres as Mohawke does throughout Lantern, but his knowledge of what gets a crowd moving, coupled with his good cheer in both playing directly to it and coyly holding back as he pleases help keep the album’s experiments a minimum of fun and danceable, but more often shocking and delightful.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20675-lantern/,Warp,2015.0,"Hudson Mohawke's Lantern album is nothing short of a masterpiece in the electronic music genre. As soon as I pressed play, I was transported into a world of sonic exploration, where futuristic soundscapes blended with classic beats to create something truly special.

Before diving into the music itself, it's worth noting Hudson Mohawke's unique background. Born Ross Birchard in Glasgow, Scotland, he began his music career as a teenager, producing beats for local rap artists. Soon after, his talents caught the attention of Kanye West, who signed him to his GOOD Music label. Since then, Hudson Mohawke has worked with a range of popular artists, including Drake, Pusha T, and Frank Ocean.

This background is evident throughout Lantern, as Hudson Mohawke deftly blends classic hip hop beats with avant-garde electronic sounds. The album was created over a period of several years, as Birchard honed his craft and experimented with different sounds and textures.

One standout track for me was ""Lil Djembe,"" which features a hypnotic beat and futuristic sound effects that transport listeners into an intergalactic dance party. But it's not just about the beats - there's a deeper emotional resonance to the music as well. ""Kettles"" is a prime example of this, with its haunting melody and poignant lyrics about the passage of time.

Overall, Lantern is a must-listen for fans of electronic music, as well as anyone looking to explore a fresh take on classic hip hop beats. Hudson Mohawke's personal touch is evident throughout the album, as he blends his own unique perspective with a deep appreciation for the genre's roots.

Personally, I found Lantern to be a captivating listening experience that kept me engaged from start to finish. While some tracks may be more challenging than others, the album as a whole is a testament to Hudson Mohawke's talent and dedication to his craft. I give it a solid 8.5 out of 10, and can't wait to see where he takes us next.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed, with specific references to songs on the album.

The Howling Hex,All-Night Fox,Rock,6.8,February 20 2005,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"There are (thankfully) few musicians whose output has been as consistently befuddling or exasperating as that of Neil Michael Hagerty. Charting all the way back to his days in Pussy Galore and straight through his chaotic decade-plus tenure as one half of Royal Trux, Hagerty has always stubbornly concealed the brilliant peaks of his unruly, willfully discordant soul, R&B;, and classic rock refractions beneath a maddening amount of dead-end, solipsistic rubbish. Though Hagerty is too talented to write off completely (during Royal Trux's early-to-mid 90s heyday I would've counted him as one of the most underrated guitar stylists in rock), even the most sympathetic listeners may have grown impatient trying to follow the plot of his oft-rudderless meandering-- particularly in the time since Royal Trux's dissolution. Although the past few years have been among the most productive of Hagerty's career, his work during this period has been scattershot even by his permissive standards, veering incautiously between double-jointed folk, Canned Heat boogie, and half-assed cosmic country without truly excelling at any station. All of which brings us to All-Night Fox, an album credited to Hagerty's new combo, the Howling Hex. Some may recognize the band name from 2003's little-heard Neil Michael Hagerty & the Howling Hex. All-Night Fox is actually the fourth release issued by this mysterious new combo, although the first three were all released in 2004 as limited edition vinyl-only documents. So this record is, for all practical purposes, the group's debut, and happily it illustrates that Hagerty has again, at long last, decided upon a sound to craft as his own. Containing eight tracks, All-Night Fox clocks in at just under 40 minutes, a length that many contemporary acts might call an EP. Opening with the spacious, reverb-laden ""Now, We're Gonna Sing"", the record hits the pavement with all cylinders steaming, as Hagerty's squawking, curve-hugging guitar anticipates every corner, and the group as a whole resembles what might've occurred had Phil Spector ever corralled a teenage Captain Beefheart. The Hex even launches ""Cast Aside the False"" with an near-direct cop of the ""Be My Baby"" beat, a tactic you'd have to be crazy to fault anybody for. Throughout the album, traditional song structures are forsaken for acreage of Hagerty's bleating, harmolodic guitar, neck-snapping male/female vocal tag-teams, and frantic, inscrutable lyrics I couldn't even hope to transcribe. And although it's all delivered with an uncharacteristic degree of focus, one can't help but escape with the belief that All-Night Fox is merely laying the groundwork for a more full-realized colossus to follow, and the hope that Hagerty has come to the same realization as well.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4003-all-night-fox/,Drag City,2005.0,"I recently had the pleasure of listening to ""All-Night Fox"", the latest album from The Howling Hex. As an avid rock music fan, I had high expectations for this release, and I was not disappointed. 

To fully appreciate this album, it is important to understand the band's history. The Howling Hex was founded by Neil Michael Hagerty, a well-known musician who has been a member of several prominent rock bands over the years. His experience and expertise are evident in the band's music, and ""All-Night Fox"" is no exception.

The album was created with a specific goal in mind - to capture the raw energy and spontaneity of a live performance. It was recorded in just one day, with all the musicians playing in the same room together. This approach creates a sense of immediacy and intimacy that is often lacking in studio recordings.

From the first notes of the opening track, ""The Counterfeiters"", it is clear that The Howling Hex is at the top of their game. The driving guitar riff and pulsing bass create a powerful energy that is impossible to resist. The album continues with a mix of upbeat rockers and more introspective tracks, each one showcasing the band's incredible musicianship.

One of my personal favorites is ""Rangers"", a haunting ballad that showcases Hagerty's impressive vocal range. His voice is both raw and emotional, conveying the lyric's sense of longing and loss. It's a perfect example of how The Howling Hex can combine seemingly disparate elements to create something truly unique.

Overall, I would give ""All-Night Fox"" a rating of 8 out of 10. While it may not be the most groundbreaking album in the world of rock music, it is a solid effort that showcases the band's talent and artistic vision. Whether you're a longtime fan of The Howling Hex or simply a lover of great rock music, this album is definitely worth a listen. So pop it on the turntable, turn up the volume, and let The Howling Hex rock your world.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed in its analysis of the musician and his history.

Bambi Molesters,Sonic Bullets: 13 from the Hip,Rock,7.9,April 24 2002,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"Think of a place you'd associate with sun and surf. I'd wager there are quite a few minds going to California right now, maybe northern Australia or Hawaii. I'd also wager that there's not a single one of you out there thinking about Croatia. Maybe it's just the recent civil conflict that still lingers in the air there, or the Cold War-inspired perception of Eastern Europe as a perpetually cold, bleak place, but Croatia doesn't get much credit for its fine Adriatic beaches outside of the countries immediately surrounding it. I don't know much about the surfing conditions in Croatia, but regardless of what they are, as far as the Bambi Molesters are concerned it may as well be Zuma Beach. Sonic Bullets is a surf album as pure as they come, drenched in spring reverb twenty fathoms deep, and indebted more deeply to Duane Eddy's twang than you are to your creditors. All the horrifying visions of human hands defiling the purity of helpless forest animals conjured by the band's name pretty much melt away upon seeing the album cover, which features a stylized blue-hued photo of a barefoot, campy/sexy spy girl sneaking around behind an obtrusive, Ventures-style typesetting. Right there, you pretty much know what you're in for. What's really surprising is just how good the music is. The Molesters crash out of the gate at full tilt with the excellent ""Theme From Slaying Beauty,"" a tune that would sit nice and tight next to anything off of Dick Dale's King of the Surf Guitar. There are no gimmicky little samples from Japanese monster movies a la Man or Astro-Man?, just spirited throwback surf that behaves largely like irony never existed. ""Malaguena"" up the ante by adding the Spanish-influenced trumpet work of guest Boris Mohoric to the fray, as the dual-guitar assault of Dalibor Pavicic and Dinko Tomljanovic moves in tidal washes around him. The gravity of bassist Lada Furlan and drummer Hrvoje Zaborac's rhythm section drags everything along like a stiff, deadly undertow. Though Sonic Bullets was largely recorded in Slovenia, the band also spent some time in Seattle, apparently befriending the Minus 5's Scott McCaughey, who contributes organ, vibes, piano, tubular bells and even bass harmonica to nearly half of the album's tracks. Fellow Minus 5-er Peter Buck adds some guitar and fuzz bass here and there as well, though he also does his best not to overshadow the already able band. Buck's star power might shift a few more units for the Bambi Molesters, but it's McCaughey whose contributions are really worth noting. His bells on ""Ice & Pinewood Trees"" significantly up the song's creepiness factor, as though Chris Eckman of the Walkabouts' deadpan monologue about hitchhiking to the ocean wasn't enough. It follows the album's only other vocal track, ""El Corazon Del Loco Jorge,"" which features a Spanish narrative courtesy of Eduardo ""Speedo"" Martinez of Finnish garage punks the Flaming Sideburns (you can't make this stuff up, folks). Though these two songs are interesting diversions, the band is generally at their best when they concern themselves with the primary task at hand: making great instrumental rock that transcends the kitsch that colors modern surf. Most good surf has some sort of edge to it, but a few of the slower songs here actually sound a bit mournful-- something that's exceedingly rare in the genre. It makes sense, of course, given that the band members all came of age during an extremely tumultuous time in their country's history, and it adds a dense of depth that makes the album more engaging. Whereas, say, Man Or Astroman?'s fine cover of Larry Weed's ""Bombora"" was simply frenzied and wild, the Molesters infuse it with a dark energy absent from any other version I've heard. Strong originals like ""Tremble & Shake"" take this even further, sometimes to the point of sounding downright menacing. ""Final Wave for the Day"" has a wonderfully sad minor-key melody juxtaposed with manic rhythms and boisterous playing, while ""Double Danger"" drips with the edgy paranoia of a great spy theme. Finally, there's the steadily creeping closer ""Chaotica,"" shrouded in McCaughey's vibes and piano while Buck, Pavicic, and Tomljanovic each stake out their own territories, one offering texture with backward strums and volume swells, another comping chords and the third picking out a smoky lead line. Beautiful stuff. Thus ends one of the most terrific surf records I've heard in ages-- the best at least since Man Or Astroman?'s Experiment Zero. Fans of the genre are advised to hastily run out and pick this up. It's probably not surprising that the Bambi Molesters are the only Croatian group I've ever even heard, but listening to Sonic Bullets has me wondering if there's any more unexplored talent over there. For now, I'm thinking I just may call a travel agent and see about a beachfront timeshare in Croatia.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/538-sonic-bullets-13-from-the-hip/,Dancing Bear,2002.0,"Are you in the mood to jump on a musical rollercoaster ride filled with electrifying tunes and powerful guitar riffs? Look no further than Bambi Molesters' album 'Sonic Bullets: 13 from the Hip.'

The Bambi Molesters, a Croatian band formed in 1995, have long been masters of their craft. Their fusion of rockabilly, surf, and spaghetti western-inspired music has won them praise from critics and fans alike. It's not surprising that the band chose the name ""Bambi Molesters"" – their music could easily be the soundtrack to a film noir set in the Wild West.

'Sonic Bullets: 13 from the Hip' is the band's fourth studio album, released in 2008. It's a culmination of years of hard work and experimentation, which is evident from the first note to the last. The album is filled with tracks that showcase the band's range and versatility. From the upbeat and catchy ""Point Break,"" to the haunting and moody ""Invasion of the Reverb Snatchers,"" there's something for everyone on this record.

Each track on the album tells a different story, and the band expertly weaves together a narrative with the instrumentation. The guitars take center stage, with driving riffs and intricate solos that transport you to another world. The drums and bass provide a solid backbone that keeps the music grounded, while the occasional use of keyboards adds a layer of complexity and texture.

But what sets Bambi Molesters apart from other rock bands is their ability to infuse their music with emotion. 'Sonic Bullets: 13 from the Hip' is no exception. Tracks like ""Malaguena,"" ""The Land of the Three Suns,"" and ""As the Dark Wave Swells"" are breathtakingly beautiful, evoking feelings of nostalgia and melancholy.

As someone who grew up on a steady diet of rock and roll, I can confidently say that 'Sonic Bullets: 13 from the Hip' is one of the best rock albums of the 21st century. It's the perfect blend of old-school rock and modern innovation, and every track is a masterpiece in its own right. From start to finish, this album takes you on a journey that you won't soon forget.

In conclusion, 'Sonic Bullets: 13 from the Hip' is a must-listen for any fan of rock music. Bambi Molesters have created a masterpiece that will stand the test of time.

The Drag City Supersession,"Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils",,3.2,January 15 2002,Matt LeMay,Contributor,"Being a talented musician must be pretty cool. While other people spend hours at a time hunched over their respective instruments, trying desperately to come up with a single song that's worth a damn, you can do better things with your time. For instance, you can feed a hungry child. Or you can build a terrarium. Or, if you're so inclined, you can record a terrible album with your talented musician friends. Of course, talent is not without its down side. One of the most common arguments used in the defense of shitty music is, ""Hey, man, these guys may not be the best musicians in the world, but they work totally hard! I've known them for years, and I've never known more hard-working, dedicated people. Fuck you for judging them! They once slept on my couch! I know the bassist's sister!"" In other words: ""They have no talent, but they try really hard."" But when a slew of crazily talented musicians come together and turn out a sloppy and tossed-off mess, things are a little harder to justify. The Drag City Supersession is made up of core musicians Bill Callahan ((Smog)), Rian Murphy, Neil Michael Hagerty, and Edith Frost. All are talented performers and songwriters; all have made significant contributions to the world of independent music; and all have done so in their own distinctively unique ways. Yet with Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils, the focus that has enabled these musicians to create such convincing work is entirely absent. And as they struggle through weak-as-fuck Sabbath covers and barely rehearsed originals, it leaves this record sounding less like a Supersession than a high school talent show. Sloppiness is okay when it's a by-product of uncontainable energy. But on Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils, with its awkward, fumbling guitar parts and poorly arranged strings, one can't help but feel that this was a project thrown together quickly by people who really didn't give a fuck about it. There's no energy. There's no fun. There's no reason for them to subject people to this. Within the first few seconds of the Bill Callahan original, ""Zero Degrees,"" that opens the record, it's clear that Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils isn't going to be an easy ride. The song itself is not nearly up to par with most of Callahan's material, relying mostly upon a vaguely dissonant and tremendously uninteresting bass riff. But as the song develops, it becomes clear why Callahan wouldn't have wanted one of his better songs to appear on this record-- it's hard to imagine somebody saying, ""Why don't I use one of my best songs for this new, thrown-together 'Supersession' so that Neil Michael Hagerty can skullfuck it with an out-of-tune slide guitar?"" There's nothing wrong with being a little out of tune when the music calls for it, but the combination of sloppy, tuneless guitar, and pointless, unmelodic bass makes ""Zero Degrees"" nothing short of painful listening. If the musicians involved in this record actually listened back to this kind of thing and said, ""Man, I can't wait for my name to be attached to this,"" they should at the very least retire, and at the very most be force-fed their own ears. Perhaps I'm being a little too hard on these people. Their collective musical talents have given me hours upon hours of enjoyment, and musical memories that will last me for the rest of my life. But all that just doesn't change the fact that Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils blows. At its best, like on Edith Frost's ""Leaving the Army,"" it's sufficiently unobtrusive, with unnecessary guitar plunking only minimally fucking up an otherwise passable song. Hey, on ""Old Man,"" when Frost is basically left to her own for a little while, it's downright pretty. But as a ""Supersession,"" with no one musician's vision guiding the way, Drag City's impressive roster is reduced to a tuneless jam band whose members don't even sound like they're having a good time. Drag City, indeed.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2439-tramps-traitors-and-little-devils/,Drag City,2001.0,"If you're a fan of experimental music, you might want to check out Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils by The Drag City Supersession. Now, I'll be frank- this isn't your average album. But don't be put off by the low rating; it's clear that The Drag City Supersession is not about pleasing everyone. 

The band has a long and storied history- they began in the late 1960s as a collective of experimental jazz musicians in Chicago, pushing the boundaries of music and sound. They gained notoriety for their wild live performances and avant-garde approach to sound. Fast forward to the present day, and they're still at it. 

This album was created during a particularly intense period of collaborative experimentation among the various members of the group. The result is Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils, a project that defies categorization. The musicians seem to be pushing and pulling at each other throughout, creating moments of dissonance and chaos that are punctuated with periods of eerie calm. 

One of the standout tracks is ""Traitor's Lament,"" which features a hauntingly beautiful saxophone solo punctuated by moments of chaotic percussion. The track ebbs and flows, experimenting with different time signatures and textures. It's a mesmerizing listening experience.

As someone who appreciates experimental music, I found Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils to be a fascinating album. It's not something I would listen to on a daily basis, but it's the kind of record that demands your attention when you do put it on. I enjoyed getting lost in the strange and unpredictable sonic landscape created by The Drag City Supersession.

Boredoms,Super Roots 10,Experimental,7.6,February 27 2009,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Ten years ago it would have been ridiculous to use the word ""formula"" when talking about the music of Osaka's Boredoms. In 1999, they were riding a wave of creativity the likes of which most bands can only dream about. In the year prior they'd released both Super Roots 7, which on better days sounds like the final word on the visceral power of rock'n'roll repetition, and Super Ae, on which they revealed themselves as masters of playful trance-inducing psychedelia with spiritual underpinnings. And they were about to put out Vision Creation Newsun, boasting a gentler but no less immediate vision that seemed, especially after Yamantaka Eye's Rebore Vol. 0 re-working a bit later, to suggest that the musical possibilities in the decade to follow would be endless. All of this came after 10 previous years of painful noise, bad punk, hilarious song titles, pointless screams, and occasionally unmatched rock power. You couldn't pin this band down. But in the decade since Vision Creation Newsun, Boredoms have interrupted long periods of quiet with absurdly grand gestures (the 77 Boadrum and 88 Boadrum events) and a couple of records that referenced or expanded upon past glories but never came close to matching them. Seadrum/House of Sun, from 2005, had two 20-minute-plus tracks that were not nearly as beautiful as the advance word made them sound, even if they managed to summon inspiring amounts of energy. (We heard talk of Eye leading his percussion-toting followers to the edge of the sea to record, conjuring images of the greatest drum-circle jams since the twilight of the Pleistocene.) And then 2007's Super Roots 9 was a 40-minute monster for drummers and pitch-shifted choir that took one thing the Boredoms did well-- gradual builds to ecstatic climaxes-- and let it play out forever. Tracks going on for far too long filled with ideas that were beaten into the ground 10 times over has always been part of the band's M.O. But when releases are so rare, they don't serve the same prankster function that they once did. Now it kind of sounds more like the Boredoms doing that one thing the Boredoms do. Again. Which, if you happen to freaking love that one thing, isn't so terrible. A new Boredoms release is still an event, even if you no longer feel the need to rush out and tell all your friends about it. Super Roots 10 snuck up on people when it appeared for sale on a website in Japan earlier this year (by which time it was already sold out-- I'm reviewing this from downloaded mp3s). It is, with one huge exception I'll get to in a second, just the Boredoms being their post-VCN drum-happy, DayGlo-streaked, build-up-and-breakdown selves. After a short intro of bassy static, we hear a track called ""Ant 10"", which exists in a nine and a half-minute original mix and is then spun off into four different remixes that mostly flow one into the next. So it turns out to be essentially another 40+-minute track. The main features of the original version are layered tribal drums, an analog synth out of early-70s Tangerine Dream running scales, and Eye, sounding as joyful as ever, singing/shouting /chanting ""Ah-u!"" and ""Hey!!!"" and layering his voice in all sorts of fun ways. Toward the end there's some tape manipulation and huge cymbal-rushes, and then everything breaks down to silence, leading into ""Estero 10"", a remix by Japanese producer Altz. The Altz remixes (another of his called ""Mineral Dub Break"" closes) and a remix by someone called DJ Finger Hat (my guess is it's Eye, which would be pseudonym number 1,328) offer an expected range of theme and variations-- drums get a bit housey, voices are extended into drones, Yoshimi's voice is added and layered to sound a little like an interlude from Einstein on the Beach, a guitar pattern is chopped into tiny pieces and sequenced. Even though it's now become so familiar and-- hate to say it-- formulaic, this stuff still has the capacity to thrill. The huge exception to the Boredoms-by-numbers feel is the almost 11-minute mix of ""Ant 10"" by Lindstrøm. The Norwegian producer essentially takes his space disco approach and toughens it up considerably to meet the forward-leaning aggression of Boredoms. Heavy drums find their way to a 4/4 beat augmented by all manner of percussion fills, a Moog sounds for a moment like it's playing the intro to the title theme from Grease, a rubbery funk bassline for the ages folds in, and ""Superstition""-style Clavinet starts bouncing around. There are a million things going on, but it still grooves. Long-time Pitchfork contributor Dominique Leone, who reviewed the last couple of Boredoms releases here and released material last year on Lindstrøm's Feedelity imprint, even drops by, adding some ""Bow bow bow"" vocals at the precise moment they're needed. Even if Lindstrøm's remix is 90% Lindstrøm's and 10% Boredoms, the change-up is hugely welcome. It's like all of a sudden Boredoms find themselves in the middle of a crazy party, where someone left the front door open and you've no idea who is going to wander in next. Time was when all Boredoms get-togethers felt that way.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12715-super-roots-10/,Avex Trax,2009.0,"Let me start by saying that if you're looking for an experimental music experience, Boredoms' 'Super Roots 10' album is a must-listen.

"Michael Beharie, Teddy Rankin-Parker",A Heart From Your Shadow,Experimental,7.2,July 30 2018,Andy Beta,Contributor,"The names of multi-instrumentalist Michael Beharie and cellist Teddy Rankin-Parker probably won’t ring bells for many people, but their list of accomplishments is long: Their genre-spanning CVs would make for a pretty unusual playlist, with credits ranging from Primus to Iron & Wine, Au Revoir Simone to Laurel Halo, Pauline Oliveros to Father John Misty. The two met a decade ago, when both were students at Oberlin, before Beharie headed to New York and Rankin-Parker lit out for Chicago. After carving out a presence on their respective scenes, they finally came together for their first record as a duo, A Heart From Your Shadow, spending time at Beharie’s living-room studio in Bed-Stuy and at a proper studio in Greenpoint; Jim O’Rourke handled mixing duties. Across 10 fractured pieces, Beharie and Rankin-Parker flit through a number of modes: gorgeous strings, drone blasts, polyrhythmic din, spoken-word études, electronic spasms, and more, never feeling the need to settle on any one for long. Like being elbowed on a crowded subway by a good-looking stranger, you come away feeling at once jostled and besotted by the results. The album’s concise opener, “Intro,” presents both extremes of the duo’s approach. Elongated cello tones and celestial voices that emerge like a mirage from the vibrating strings make for an enchanting two minutes. But at precisely 2:01, the vibrato turns malicious and dark and the angelic voices suddenly become shrieking sirens—a bewildering trick if you’re walking on the sidewalk with earbuds in. The maneuver encapsulates the urban experience as soundtracked by your own personal playlist, with real life breaking noisily in every few feet. On “Smooth Face,” the wailing sirens return, but this time, Rankin-Parker’s cello moves in tandem with them: an echo rather than a rupture. “Paper Tiger” finds the duo evoking the shape-shifting surprises of Oneohtrix Point Never, solemn and sparse for a span, glitching and overdriven the next, gossamer melodies turning into deep growls. There are moments of deep-space darkness, of traversing junkyard mounds, of breathing in rarefied air; it becomes increasingly hard to discern just which parts have been written and which ones improvised. Depending on where you dip into “Roses,” you might find it a mournful cello solo, impenetrable feedback, keyboard noodling, near-silent scraping, or an alien chorale. The set’s most fascinating moments come when the duo folds polyrhythmic patterns into spliced sonic textures. Clanging highlight “Gully” draws from Beharie’s Jamaican heritage, its beat reminiscent of the strange yet visceral riddims of Equiknoxx and the metal-on-metal scrape of This Heat. “Fake Money” immerses us in lo-fi beats that sound submerged in a lake. Lose track of the muffled rhythms and you soon find yourself amid plucked and buzzing strings. Heard from beginning to end, the album can cause whiplash, while adding tracks to a playlist can scramble the mood in the best way. It’s one of Beharie and Rankin-Parker’s neat tricks: expertly sliding sounds all around you, continually leaving you bewildered and in unfamiliar new spaces.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/michael-beharie-teddy-rankin-parker-a-heart-from-your-shadow/,Mondoj,2018.0,"If you're in search of music that truly pushes the boundaries of genre, look no further than Michael Beharie and Teddy Rankin-Parker's experimental album, A Heart From Your Shadow. With a rating of 7.2 out of 10, this album is a must-listen for anyone craving music that defies categorization and is unapologetically unique.

The story behind the creation of this album is just as fascinating as the music itself. Michael Beharie and Teddy Rankin-Parker have been friends and collaborators for years, having both studied at CalArts and performed together in various musical projects. For this album, the two artists set out to explore the relationship between human emotion and technology, blending field recordings and synthesized sounds into a cohesive and captivating sonic experience.

From the first notes of the opening track ""Eviscerate Your Heart"", it's clear that this album is something special. The haunting tones of a cello blend seamlessly with glitchy electronic beats, creating a soundscape that is both eerie and beautiful. As the album progresses, each track builds on the last, challenging listeners to keep up with the artists' ever-shifting sonic explorations.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Warm Glow"", a mesmerizing blend of ethereal vocals, delicate guitar work, and pulsating beats. This track exemplifies the beauty and complexity of the album, showcasing the artists' ability to seamlessly blend organic and synthetic sounds into something truly otherworldly.

As someone who has always admired experimental music, A Heart From Your Shadow is definitely an album that resonated with me on a personal level. It's rare to come across music that feels truly innovative in a world where so many artists are content to simply replicate what's come before. This album is a reminder that music can be a vehicle for pushing boundaries and exploring uncharted sonic territory.

Kweku Collins,Nat Love,Rap,8.0,April 13 2016,kris ex,Contributor,"Since 2014, Kweku Collins has been releasing small, intimate, and subdued hip-hop-informed bohemian rhapsodies on self-worth and the meaning of life. His perspective wobbles hazily between navel-gazing and philosophical musings, in a way that can only be conveyed by a late '90s-born suburban kid living just outside one of the most violent inner cities in the US. His output has been all bedroom music (literally: he produced, recorded and mixed everything himself; in his Evanston, Il bedroom) and he seems willing to save the world, but only if he can get past his own self-doubt and willing alienation. ""My momma told me I am a king/ And I believe her/ Why I used to think that I wasn't shit"" he sang on ""Kings"" from last year's rewarding Say It Here, While It's Safe EP. On the song he also said ""R.I.P [to] my demons"" and confessed that ""today we feel like Kings/ I ain't never been this happy."" But euphoria is not Collins' constant companion; melancholy and second-guessing introspection are. And on his new LP, Nat Love—the name references the former slave, cowboy, Black folk hero, and author also known as Deadwood Dick—his tendency to turn inward and re-emerge with poetic reveries are strengths that serve him well. Thematically, Collins is more about observations than declarations, inquiry over polemic. As a former slam poet, he tends to write in circles of wordplay or elongated strands of thought that seek meaning through journal-like streams of discovery. On ""Nat's Intro"" he confesses that, ""Well, I listen to Future and lay up/ Playin' like I am a student / I know no future is proven/ But I know some people that prove it,"" before repeatedly asking, both confident and unsure: ""Is this what you wanted?"" (His answer: ""There is no answer/ “Til you answer."") None of the music sounds as dreary or as downtrodden as the lyrics would suggest: the tracks are light and bouncy, even when they're somber. There's a celestial and cosmic grace to ""Ego Killed Romance,"" a charming playground swing to ""Vanilla Skies,"" and a sublime flip of D'Angelo's ""One Mo' Gin"" on ""Stupid Roses."" On ""Death a Salesman""—the lone track on the project which Collins didn't have a hand in producing; instead passing off duties to his Closed Sessions labelmate oddCouple—there's an inspired and melodic take on the sentiments expressed by Ice Cube's ""I Wanna Kill Sam"": ""See, I have this Uncle Sam/ And I hate his ass so much/With a finger in my face/ As if I should give a fuck/ He said he'll give me a gun/ And he think I should shoot for him/I say, 'Sam, I think you right'/ Then I turned the gun on him,"" he raps with a chuckle. This is the kind of music that's made by someone who was a toddler when André 3000 explored a love below and k-os dropped his first LP. There are hints of trap, folk, and neo-soul coming together to form a new micro-genre of hip-hop that's part part Chance the Rapper, part Wyclef, part Future, part Chief Keef. The sounds here are immersed in the dance of lingua franca and colloquialisms and tastes and cultures defined by a generation raised on playlists and the ability to stream the history of music on their phones for less than the price of a single CD. When Collins sings, he's not singing by R&B yardsticks; when he raps, his vocals sound like rambling rocks in a river of thoughts, more indebted to spoken word than rap, but still more rap than spoken word. ""If I'm a rapper then she's a bad bitch,"" says Collins on ""Stupid Roses,"" a song about marijuana that doubles as a meditation on a love half-remembered but still felt. It's not the full-on ode that D'Angelo's ""Brown Sugar"" was—Collins seems conflicted about his ""love for cannabis""—and the double narrative and sense of self-hate and addiction feel like they're talking about his  greater conflicts with love and self-acceptance. On ""The Outsider"" he posits that ""love is a battlefield/ Pat Benatar shit"" and declares ""I'ma be a legend/ I'ma be a Johnny to your Dolly."" Those aren't the kind of references typical to a hip-hop song; they're the observations of an insider walking the line between finding and defining himself.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21812-nat-love/,Closed Sessions,2016.0,"Hey there music fans, today I'm excited to share my thoughts on the latest release from hip hop artist Kweku Collins, ""Nat Love"". With a solid 8.0 rating, this album is definitely worth a listen.

For those who are unfamiliar with Kweku Collins, let me give you a little background. Collins is a rapper, singer, and songwriter from Evanston, Illinois. He first made a name for himself on SoundCloud, where he gained a following for his unique style of blending hip hop, R&B, and indie rock. His debut album, ""Nat Love"", was released in 2016 and has now become a fan favorite.

The story of the album's creation is just as interesting as its unique sound. Collins recorded much of ""Nat Love"" in a makeshift recording studio in his mother's basement. It's impressive how he transformed this modest space into a well-crafted world of sound.

One of my favorite tracks from the album is ""Ego Killed Romance."" With lyrics that touch on personal struggles and the harsh realities of life, it's easy to get lost in the reflective nature of the song. Collins' flow and vocal delivery is smooth yet gritty, creating a feeling of raw emotion that is hard to replicate.

Another standout on the album is ""Stupid Rose."" The track captures a feeling of youthful energy and carefree abandon that is sure to get you moving. The lyrical content, again, emphasizes the difficulties of growing up and the pain of maturing.

Throughout the entire album, Collins demonstrates his ability to create textured beats and seamlessly merge different genres of music in a way that feels wholly unique. Not only that, every song is crafted with thoughtful attention to detail, from the layered production to the confident lyricism.

Overall, ""Nat Love"" is an impressive album that showcases Kweku Collins' undeniable talent as a musician and lyricist. It's the kind of album that will leave you pondering and reflecting on life and its complexities, while simultaneously making you want to dance. So go ahead, give it a listen! You won't regret it.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed, while Review B is shorter and more concise.

Various Artists,Ed Rec Vol. 2,,6.4,March 29 2007,Tim Finney,Contributor,"Bob Sinclar's 2006 hit ""Rock This Party""-- an amusing rendezvous between dancehall's Kopa riddim and samples of C+C Music Factory's ""Gonna Make You Sweat"", and by far last year's most perverse French house track-- revealed just how meaningless the separations between French house's underground and overground are. You won't hear anything like the Sinclair track on Ed Rec 2, Ed Banger's second label compilation, although it's not for lack of trying. The stumbling block is in their heads, perhaps: Whereas Ed Banger are stymied by the erroneous assumption that interesting ideas can only be realized at the expense of unambiguously seizing the pop jugular, Sinclar just went out and did both. Ed Rec 2 reveals clearly enough the flaws in the label's aesthetic vision: resident rapper Uffie, already a dubious proposition, sounds positively execrable on her ode to haters, ""Dismissed"", but if this is by far the worst inclusion here, it's not (just) because Uffie can't rap. Blame the creative bankruptcy of the label's intermittent fascination with sneeringly amateurish, stuttery send-ups of old skool electro, which also ruins the Yoko Ono electro of DJ Mehdi's ""Lucky Girl"". These artists should, one and all, give up on trying to tell jokes. Luckily, most of Ed Rec 2 witnesses the label roster in consolidation mode, staging a strategic retreat to the messy, rock-influenced take on French house which Daft Punk codified on Human After All. While the move invites accusations of redundancy, I'm inclined to look upon Ed Banger's reduced expectations with some sympathy. One needs to accept from the outset that Ed Banger are unlikely to produce something as all-conquering as ""Rock & Roll"" or as marvelously confounding as ""Aerodynamic"" in order to fully enjoy the enthusiasm with which they go about colonizing the space between these two poles, from the ridiculous Genesis synth runs of Mr. Flash's ""Disco Dynamite"" to the rusted-on percussion presets of Feadz's lurching ""Edwrecker"". And perhaps some of the elder statesmen's production nous has rubbed off as well. Justice's ""Phantom"" fuses hyper-plasticity with noise for noisiness' sake in characteristic fashion. While it's hardly surprising, it's perhaps the duo's best executed effort to date, the descent from disco sparkle into a mid-range black hole and back out again carried off with agility, even grace. Busy P's ""Rainbow Man"" may simply reiterate the same grinding, slow, mechanical house blueprint that Daft Punk established with ""Steam Machine"" and that SebastiAn has since made his own, but why should we expect more than good craftmanship? Why can't there be an entire genre of these menacingly sexy dominatrix backing tracks? By comparison, SebastiAn's own ""Greel"" is disappointingly lacking in character, its mechanic gewalt expressing brute force but nothing to give that power meaning. Indeed, it's usually when Ed Banger's artists get dark-- rather than merely loud-- that they are most compelling. Far and away the best track on this compilation, Krazy Baldhead's ""Strings of Death"" performs the unlikely feat of summarizing the label's entire aesthetic while sounding like nothing else in its back catalogue, boasting the type of muscular rock groove that the label should have been cornering all along. Instead of settling for a straightahead churn or stomp, it slinks its way around overblown, bluesy guitar riffs while paranoid synths and snapping electro beats add a slight industrial inflection, somewhere between Ministry at their most lithe and Depeche Mode at their most heavy. It's actually thrilling, and I'd wager part of the thrill derives from the unexpectedness of the equation, as if industrial glam-rock is the unintended and explosive result of a naÃ¯ve French House alchemy experiment. If Ed Banger can only stumble upon greatness by accident, let's hope the artists never work out exactly what it is they're doing on tracks like these.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10050-ed-rec-vol-2/,"Vice,Because,Ed Banger",2007.0,"If you're a fan of the nan genre, then you've probably heard of Ed Rec Vol. 2, the second compilation album released by French label Ed Banger Records. With a rating of 6.4 out of 10, this album might not be the most heavily praised in the nan world, but it definitely has its moments.

Before we dive into the music itself, let's take a quick look at Ed Banger Records' history. Founded in 2003, the label has been a driving force in the French electronic music scene, bringing together artists from across the globe with their unique and innovative sound. And Ed Rec Vol. 2 is a perfect representation of this eclectic mix, featuring tracks from well-known artists like Justice and SebastiAn, as well as up-and-comers like Mr. Flash and Vicarious Bliss.

So how did this album come to be? Well, it all started when label founder Pedro Winter (aka Busy P) decided it was time for a second compilation album to showcase the label's diverse roster of talent. He enlisted the help of his artists, who contributed both new and previously released tracks. The result was a 14-track album that spanned various sub-genres within the nan world, including electro, house, and even a bit of hip-hop.

Now, let's get into the music itself. Right off the bat, the opening track ""Waters of Nazareth"" by Justice sets the tone for the entire album, with its gritty basslines and distorted synths. From there, we're taken on a journey that includes the upbeat and energetic ""Killin' It"" by DJ Mehdi, the funky and soulful ""Up & Down"" by Mr. Flash, and the hauntingly beautiful ""Walking in the Sun"" by Vicarious Bliss.

Of course, not every track on the album is a winner. ""Wallace"" by Krazy Baldhead feels a bit repetitive and dull, while ""Motor"" by SebastiAn is so heavily distorted that it's difficult to fully appreciate the melody. But overall, Ed Rec Vol. 2 is a solid addition to any nan lover's collection.

Personally, I really enjoyed the more experimental tracks on the album, like ""Eagle in Your Mind"" by Para One and ""Rubber"" by Uffie. These tracks pushed boundaries and left me feeling excited about the future of nan music.

In conclusion, Ed Rec Vol. 2 might not be the most groundbreaking nan album out there, but it's definitely worth a listen for fans of the genre. With its mix of established and emerging artists, and its willingness to take risks with sound and structure, this album is truly representative of the Ed Banger Records ethos.","Step 1: Review A uses more complex vocabulary and sentence structure.

Sunroof!,Cloudz,"Experimental,Rock",6.8,January 19 2004,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"Matthew Bower, the body behind England's Sunroof!, seems unusually preoccupied with staving off redundancy: Cloudz is not only markedly different from his earlier records, it's also an album so internally varied that it feels almost genreless, coyly hopping from ambient ooze to craggy noise to thick, droning waves of guitar. Considering Bower's ample discography as an avant-noise artist, it was once reasonable to accuse him of cribbing an agenda from his mold-cracking predecessors (see: Rhys Chatham, Glenn Branca, La Monte Young). But no matter how heavily annotated his previous work may have been, Cloudz is a stubbornly contemporary record, taking its cues from modern technology and aesthetics. For those familiar with Bower's former experiments, both as Sunroof! and with his old band Skullflower, Cloudz may seem like a shockingly docile departure, without a single hike into harsh, bleating, feedback-heavy noise. Instead, Bower serves pretty half-melodies and blurry, pre-dawn beats, sketching a vague, meandering, half-lit landscape. Even at its most aggressive, Cloudz is still far more gentle and inviting than anything else Bower has done, and while the sudden shift into tranquility (slyly hinted at on the second disc of 2002's Bliss) might perplex some longtime fans, it also backhandedly suggests that Bower's frame of reference has finally expanded to include some of his current droner-peers (see: the easy atmospherics of Labradford or Stars of the Lid). Appropriately, each song on Cloudz has been designated its own ""cloud,"" qualified only by a corresponding track number. Ultimately, Bower's additional nomenclature is almost laughably unnecessary, considering that these compositions evoke more than enough white, wispy images all on their own. Cloud One, the buoyant ""Machine"", layers loads of smooth, chirping bleeps (including samples of twittering birds) over a soft piano line, each tone just sweet enough to sound vaguely celestial, building nearly ten minutes of peaceable, meandering light. ""Viva"" mixes in bits of crank and crunch; ""Tornado Rose Canoe"" is packed with Bower's classic guitar squeal, including a big, sweaty electric solo. While occasionally mesmerizing, Cloudz is still more effective in theory than it is in practice. Extended exposure quickly reveals the gaps in his matrix: Bower's aggressive pursuit of diversity, while not necessarily responsible for an inherently disjointed product, does break the sense of cohesion and atmospherics that's necessary for these sorts of albums to function well over time. By opting for internal tension over cohesion, Bower takes a big gamble with our attention spans that, while admirable, doesn't fully pay off.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7587-cloudz/,VHF,2003.0,"Cloudz by Sunroof!: An Experimental Masterpiece with a Twist of Rock

As I hit play on Sunroof!'s latest music album, Cloudz, my ears were immediately greeted with a mix of ambient sounds that transported me away to a new world, one that is raw, experimental, and a complete feast for the senses. As an avid listener of experimental rock, my expectations were high, but Sunroof! managed to exceed them with this one. 

Before I dive deep into the music, let's talk about the band's history. Sunroof! is a British experimental rock band that has been around since 1998. The band is known for its unique musical approach, which is a blend of avant-garde, noise rock, and psychedelic rock. The group's founder and lead vocalist, Matthew Bower, is a respected figure in the experimental music scene, and his creativity is evident in every track of their latest album, Cloudz. 

Cloudz was created during a year when the world was in a chaos, and uncertainty was looming all around us. The band took the opportunity to channel these emotions into their music, and the result is a work of art that explores themes of introspection and escapism. The 10 tracks on this album are a blend of slow guitar riffs, haunting vocals, electro beats, and samples woven together to create a sound that is both prevailing and enchanting. 

Throughout the album, Sunroof! experiments with different soundscapes, and it's evident that the band has poured their creativity into this album. The opening track, ""Wormwood,"" sets the tone for the rest of the album, with its distorted guitar riffs that flow into atmospheric sounds. While ""Daisy Cutter"" is a bit more upbeat, with its heavy drums and hypnotic guitar riffs. ""Riding Dirty"" stands out with its catchy beat and distorted bassline. The ninth track, ""Sunship,"" offers a glimpse into the kaleidoscopic world Sunroof! has created, with its dreamy melody and psychedelic sounds. 

What I love about Cloudz is its ability to take the listener on a journey through emotions. Each track offers something new, and you can't help but get lost in the soundscapes created by Sunroof!. The band has managed to blend the experimental and rock genres seamlessly, and the result is an album that I keep coming back to. 

In conclusion, Cloudz is an album that deserves recognition for its innovative approach to music. Sunroof! has managed to create an experimental masterpiece that is both unique and captivating. While some listeners may find the soundscapes a bit too experimental, I believe this album is a must-listen for anyone who appreciates innovation and creativity in music. With an overall rating of 6.8 out of 10, I would say that this album deserves a much higher score for the risks and efforts that Sunroof! has taken with it.","1.

A Cloud Mireya,Singular,,7.7,August 1 2006,Rob Mitchum,Contributor,"The last time I reviewed a Scott Herren project, he responded by calling me an idiotic and ignorant American, which is probably about the worst thing I've been called by someone who didn't have a Weezer song in their e-mail address. Criticism is dangerous. Don't try this at home, kids. Ironically, Herren was taking violent issue with a largely positive review, albeit one in which my praise had been obscured by what, in retrospect, was an ill-conceived joke about cultural sensitivity. My main thesis, unclouded by the jest, was that Savath & Savalas' mini-album finale, Mañana, had outperformed the project's previous output because it started to tweak rather than reverently reproduce the Catalan folk music at its heart. Admirable as Herren's efforts to explore the music and culture of half his genetic background were, these excavations only truly took flight when he incorporated the rest of his heritage, up to and including his recent history as hyphenated-loop-splicer extraordinaire. Thankfully, A Cloud Mireya picks up somewhat from where that previous pseudonym left off, retaining that project's ethereal, soothing atmosphere. This time around, Herren trades in Eva Puyuelo Muns for Claudia Deheza, formerly of the excitably named On!Air!Library!, to fill the role of muse/singer/collaborator. Despite being detached from her twin sister Alley, Deheza still contributes characteristically strange but plush vocals, helped by Herren's manipulations and occasional low-part harmonization. Musically, Herren contributes a fascinating mélange of his international influences without tipping the balance toward any one locality or ignoring the technology of his work as Prefuse 73. Songs like ""These Nights"", with its mellow psychedelia simmering over a loosely funky drum kit, or ""Illustional"", which travels from skittery bossa nova to a vaguely Middle Eastern conclusion, reveal a more successful hybrid of Herren's myriad influences. It's enough to sustain songs much longer than the typical ADD Herren runtime, most notably the sprawling, 12-minute suite ""Bliss Inseclusion"", which repels boredom by evolving through several different phases of Savath-ish fingerpicking, post-rock crecendos, and backward-loop mayhem. Of course, this kind of music always runs the risk of altitude sickness, chilling out to the point of hypothermia. ""Another Day"" and ""These Flowers"" run afoul of this fine line, mostly due to Herren's decision to eschew the use of his signature itchy percussion; without his unpredictable ear for rhythm as a tether, Deheza's airy singing floats off all too easily. Those highly processed vocals, when coupled with relatively straight backing, also occasionally wander into dangerous Enya/Sade territory, as on ""Safety in Number One"". But to the duo's credit, these new-age moments are rare relative to placid but intricately detailed compositions like ""Winter Sleep"". Exotic without being curatorial, sparse without being simple, Singular suggests that A Cloud Mireya may be the first of Herren's personae to give the Prefuse 73 work serious competition for flagship status...and I'm not just saying that to avoid his hate mail.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9281-singular/,Eastern Developments,2006.0,"If there's one thing that stands out about A Cloud Mireya's latest album 'Singular' it is their organic and natural approach to their genre-defying sound. As a listener, I was immediately struck by the band's ability to take even the most obscure and seemingly unrelated musical elements and weave them together into a cohesive and compelling whole. It's a testament to their ability as musicians and composers that they're able to create such an eclectic and vibrant piece of work that stands out from the pack.

One of the most interesting aspects of 'Singular' is the band's history and their unique approach to their craft. A Cloud Mireya formed in the early 2000s with the goal of creating music that pushed the boundaries of the typical nan genre. They spent years honing their craft and experimenting with different sounds and styles before finally coming to the realization that their greatest strength was in combining seemingly unrelated musical elements to create something entirely new.

The result is 'Singular', an album that is both diverse and cohesive. From the opening track ""Pulse"" to the closing song ""Fading"", the album takes the listener on a journey through a myriad of musical styles and sounds. There are moments of intense energy and moments of calm introspection, all seamlessly woven together by the band's exceptional musicianship.

The album's standout tracks include ""Last Exit"", which boasts an infectious chorus that will have you singing along in no time. ""Senses"" is a slower, more introspective track that showcases the band's vulnerability and emotional range. Meanwhile, ""Aftershock"" is a masterful blend of electronic beats and acoustic guitar that will have you grooving from start to finish.

As a fan of the nan genre, I found 'Singular' to be a refreshing departure from the norm. The band's commitment to experimentation and pushing the boundaries of their genre make them stand out in a crowded musical landscape. Their natural approach to music-making also comes across on this album, making it an organic and engaging listen.

Overall, I highly recommend 'Singular' to anyone looking for something fresh and exciting in the world of music. With its varied sounds and exceptional musicianship, it's a standout album that is sure to inspire and delight. A Cloud Mireya has once again shown that they are a force to be reckoned with in the music industry, and I cannot wait to see what they come up with next.","1.

Various Artists,Blank Field,,7.0,September 21 2005,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"In 2002, the nomadic Montreal electronic arts collective Champ Libre enlisted maverick composer Francisco López as musical curator for its multimedia ""Cité des Ondes"" event. For the occasion López assembled a formidable international roster of experimental sound artists that included such disparate talents as Japanese noise mainstay Merzbow, Australian avant-garde guitarist Oren Ambarchi, and Portland, Ore.-based sound sculptor Daniel Menche. Now López has edited and mixed Blank Field, a compilation of live performances from the event. And despite the inherent limitations of this decontextualized format, the collection proves to be a remarkable, frequently stupefying artifact that veers madly from one sonic extremity to another. Performed and recorded live at Montreal's Craig pumping station-- a structure built in 1887 to help control the floodwaters of the St. Lawrence River-- this music was created as just one aspect of a program that also showcased various electronic, architectural, and video art installations. In his own work, López has advocated an immersive listening environment, sometimes going as far as issuing blindfolds to his audience members in order to enhance their focus on the music. Here it's left unspecified whether or not these performances were originally accompanied by any other visual presentations, but nevertheless each of these outwardly diverse pieces share a certain sense of open-ended space that grants them a vaguely unfinished character, as if they're intended to be just another vibrant feature of an active urban landscape. The six solo artists represented here were selected by López for what he obliquely refers to as the ""physicalization"" of their sound, placing little importance on instrumental technique or process as they each formulate their own aural universe. First up is a relatively brief electronic track by France's Manon Anne Gillis, followed by a more prolonged piece from U.S.-based composer Michael Northam. These tracks are both finely textured sequences of tiny, enigmatic occurrences, with Northam's in particular making such extensive use of prolonged silence and barely-audible drones that if you've got a moderately busy household it's only through intense concentration that you'll be able to detect whether anything is happening at all. Things pick up considerably with Ambarchi's piece, an exquisite lattice of humming, gently plucked guitar tones that compares favorably to some of Loren Connor's most lyrical solo work. From there it's a rather abrupt segue into the digital anthill of Japan's Shunichiro Okada, who presents an itchy, beatless series of scrapes and buzzes with little regard for listener comfort. After that, prepare yourself to be deafened by the brutal one-two sucker punch of Merzbow and Menche, especially if you've still got your speakers cranked from trying to hear the Northam track. Though predictably noisy, Merzbow's contribution is actually a reasonably tempered affair, its grainy, unsettled lurch providing one of the collection's only instances of discernable rhythm. And Menche furnishes the album a fittingly radical capper with his droning symphonic swells and amplified organic contortions. Throughout it all, López does his best to create in these pieces some semblance of continuity, allowing each track to bleed into the next with a cinematic slow dissolve. But for the most part he has wisely chosen to leave himself out of the frame, realizing that it's the bewildering multiplicity of these distinctive voices that gives Blank Field its strange and potent juice.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2098-blank-field/,Alien8,2005.0,"Blank Field is an exceptional compilation album that ventures deep into the world of nan music, featuring an array of talented artists. The album has a unique sound, blending various styles to create something truly special, and while it may not be for everyone, I was undoubtedly impressed.

The artists featured on the album range from up-and-coming performers to veteran musicians, each with their distinct style and approach to nan. They appear to understand and appreciate the intricacies of nan music, and every track on the album is a testament to their passion and skill.

The album opens with the dreamy and atmospheric ""Lost in the Field"" by newcomer artist Maxine, which immediately sets the tone for what the listener can expect. The track is cautiously crafted, with smooth, delicate melodies that tantalize the ears, followed by a steady drum beat interwoven with a gentle piano.

The album's centerpiece, ""River of Nan,"" by the Grammy-nominated producers, SounDaLuve, featuring the angelic vocals of rising singer Janice, is an absolute masterpiece. The track's downtempo beat, combined with the delicate twinkle of the piano and the soothing melody of Janice's voice, makes it a standout on the album.

Although the album has no weak points and can be enjoyed from beginning to end, if I were to choose one track that highlights the album's diversity, I would pick ""Field Dance"" by the legendary artist Kyle Williams. The song is unique, combining elements of traditional nan with a more contemporary sound. It's a perfect example of the innovation that has kept nan music fresh and relevant.

Without a doubt, this is a remarkable album that exhibits the unique talent of the artists involved, each bringing something unique to the album. Their passion for music is evident in every note, and every track is a testament to the hard work and dedication that went into its creation.

As someone who generally enjoys nan music, I was pleasantly surprised by Blank Field. It introduced me to some terrific new artists and provided me with a fresh perspective on the genre as a whole. Although the album may not be everyone's cup of tea, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to experience nan music from a new and exciting angle.

Chief Keef,Bang 3,Rap,7.1,August 13 2015,Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,"To some rap fans, Chief Keef is still a reliable wellspring of dense, intriguing street rap; to others, he's a misguided and spoiled ne'er-do-well who has been making sloppy Death-of-Rap mixtapes in his mansion since ""Love Sosa"" fell off the bottom of the charts. Even a cursory listen to Keef's new album, though, pokes a hole, or several, in the latter diagnosis. Bang 3 is clearly not the work of a contrarian, unfocused artist (or, for that matter, an ""outsider"" one) actively trying to antagonize and self-sabotage; nor is it an awkward or even phoned-in bid for renewed pop appeal. It's the work of a mature rapper and songwriter, putting the skills he developed over several years spent branching out stylistically to good use. The release of Bang 3 carries some significance for Keef. This project has been in limbo since 2013; it was postulated first as his sophomore Interscope release, then as an album-turned-mixtape (a kiss-off to label bureaucracy), then, following the loss of his deal, as an independent album to arrive exactly one year ago. Luckily, Bang 3 isn't a too-little-too-late effort like Gunplay's recent, forestalled full-length; instead, it sounds like Keef signaling a new beginning. The higher, clearer production values are most immediately noticeable—this is the crispest-sounding Keef release since 2012's *Finally Rich—*and its well-ironed-out song structures. It feels like a new coat of paint to befit a new partnership: The rapper is in the honeymoon phase of a new deal with Greek billionaire, web entrepreneur, and probable psychopath Alki David's multi-platform entertainment company FilmOn, and the sense that he's getting some new encouragement (and constructive criticism) is all over this confident and studied-sounding music. On Bang 3, his voice is turned up loud, left untreated and pushed to the front of the mix, highlighting smaller, expressive details in his delivery. He builds energy across verses rather than hammering on one idea, relishing word sounds and inflecting his patterns with a conversational, sing-songy style: ""I'm rocking Tweet, beat, skeet, then delete"" (from ""You""). Often, the fun he's having in the booth is infectious, sellling chancier lines like ""Remember having pistol fights, now I'm having food fights/ Now we having rack fights, now we having jewel fights"" (from ""New School""). For the most part, the production stays behind the rapping, unlike Keef's in-house work on Sorry 4 the Weight and the self-produced Back from the Dead 2. Trusted Atlanta stalwart Zaytoven is here, as is Keef's first and most important collaborator, his childhood ally Young Chop. On ""Facts"", produced by Glo Gang, he delivers some of his most pointed and emotional lyrics on the album over eerie synth string seesaws. That said, while these songs feel more well-plotted and pristinely delivered than anything he has released in a while (that is not to say ""better""), you still get the feeling they are molded from Keef's first thoughts after stepping in the booth. In this case, this makes for a lot of very good, but only a few great tracks; the rigorously composed '80s-inflected ballad ""Ain't Missing You""— with its gunshot timpanis, EKG fluttering, and fierce hook—is a one-off novelty, not indicative of a new, aggressively poppy direction. Ever since the the sleek pop appeal of Finally Rich, fans have wondered if the rapper will someday make another streamlined, unassailably consistent project.  Bang 3 seems to signal that, despite his newfound poise, he won't; he's not interested in that. That's not a bad thing, and it's even something of a relief to not be constantly waiting for some succinct return-to-form moment. The key to enjoying his work is appreciating the sweet spots, the moments where his reckless experimentation and his unmistakable attitude intersect and become more than the sum of their parts. These are tapes you wander into slowly and patiently, bypassing some murkier, hastier-sounding clunkers until you find the music that both sounds like no one else and begs for replays reveals itself. It's usually worth it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20925-bang-3/,Self-released,2015.0,"You know how some music just stays with you long after it's over? That's the feeling I had after listening to Chief Keef's ""Bang 3"" album. It's a testament to the Chicago rapper's talent and the evident influence his music has had on the rap industry as a whole.

Keef's rise to fame is nothing short of impressive. Born in Chicago in 1995, Keef emerged as a prominent member of the drill music scene in the early 2010s. His debut album, ""Finally Rich,"" dropped in 2012 and quickly became a hit. Keef was soon hailed as the ""King of Drill"" and became one of the most prominent figures in the rap game.

""Bang 3"" is Keef's third studio album, and it's sure to be a fan favorite. The album's creation story is a unique one - Keef originally announced the album's release in 2014, but it was delayed several times due to legal disputes between the rapper and his former label, Interscope Records. Keef eventually released the album independently in 2015.

In many respects, ""Bang 3"" is vintage Chief Keef. Keef's signature style is on full display throughout the album, with heavy beats, autotune-heavy vocals, and a hypnotic flow. The album is packed with bangers, from the hard-hitting ""Faneto"" to the infectious ""Ain't Missing You.""

One standout track is ""Bouncin',"" which features a catchy beat and Keef's clever wordplay. On the track, Keef raps about his success and the haters who try to bring him down. He proclaims, ""I'm not slowing down, I'm just pacing. They said I fell off but they mistaken.""

I also appreciate Keef's more introspective tracks, like ""Superheroes,"" where he reflects on his success and the people who have supported him along the way. The song's catchy chorus and emotional lyrics make for a standout track on the album.

Overall, I think ""Bang 3"" is a solid addition to Chief Keef's discography. Fans of Keef's previous work will appreciate the album's consistency, while newcomers will be drawn in by the rapper's distinct style and mesmerizing beats. Despite some mixed reviews when it was first released, I give ""Bang 3"" a solid 7.1 out of 10 - this album is worth checking out.","1.

Kid606,Pretty Girls Make Raves EP,Electronic,6.9,July 11 2006,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"There hasn't been much in Kid606's circuitous recording career that would suggest he'd have any interest in making a record like Pretty Girls Make Raves, which is likely the very reason that he has now decided to do so. The Kid (aka Miguel Depedro) has always been most readily defined by his stubborn refusal to be pigeonholed, even when it has come at the expense of a coherent and navigable discography. True to form, Pretty Girls Make Raves bears almost no relation to Depedro's impressionistic 2005 album Resilience, just as it is also unrecognizably distant from both the splintered breakbeat extremism of his early years and his periodic heart-tugging ambient interludes. Instead, Pretty Girls is a blunt instrument of gritty analog techno, on which Depedro displays an uncharacteristic degree of restraint and focus to craft some of his burliest, no-nonsense Tigerbeat6 productions yet. Evidently the weak pun of the album's title is meant to be taken at face value, as the music here makes no direct reference to either the band Pretty Girls Make Graves or the Smiths' song-- for which we should be grateful. Though it's billed as a tribute to Baltimore club and bass-heavy techno, as with many of Kid606's releases the album courses with sneering punk energy-- all captured with the grainy B&W imprecision of a Xeroxed concert flyer stapled to a lightpost. As such, it doesn't take much to imagine the sturdy, reductive near-riffs of tracks like ""Meet Me at the Bottom"" or ""Comeuppance"" transposed from the Kid's vintage electronic gear to traditional post-hardcore guitar structures. Throughout the album, Kid606 makes minimal use of samples and hairpin edits, at least by the manic standards of his previous work. Here he shows patience, allowing his dense, thick-bottomed beats the space to expand and develop before jumping to the next idea, a practice that increases the monumental impact of each additional new sonic element. The locomotive opener ""Let It Rock"" is punctuated by pep-squad yells and deformed squeals that sound like an airliner's faulty landing gear, while ""Get Down Low"" builds its curious forward momentum via lurching steam-press rhythms. Simplest and most effective of all might be the hard-driving ""Chicken Fight"", a bleary, gimmick-free scorcher that doesn't allow its reverence for classic Jeff Mills/Laurent Garnier techno to sidestep or overwhelm its ruthless body-moving utility. With an attack this rudimentary, however, Kid606 has left himself little room for any missteps. Adornments like the distorted, DFA-friendly vocals on ""Meet Me at the Bottom"" or ""T.Y.T.R."" seem rather inconsequential, as Depedro takes easy lyrical potshots at ex-girlfriends and faux-hipsters with what sounds like Velcro taped over his mouth. And as with much of his recent music, Pretty Girls Make Raves only makes genuine sense when considered as an adjunct to Kid606's existing body of work, seeming to be another display of agile versatility rather than raw invention. Despite the album's massive and satisfying ephemeral force, as the lights come up and the floor empties out listeners may be left to wonder yet again where exactly Kid606's diffuse trail is leading and how we'll recognize him once we get there.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9165-pretty-girls-make-raves-ep/,Tigerbeat6,2006.0,"Kid606's ""Pretty Girls Make Raves EP"" is a mesmerizing and unique foray into the world of electronic music. As a fan of the genre and a lover of innovative soundscapes, this EP was a real treat to listen to. My overall rating for this album would be a solid 6.9 out of 10.

To delve into the history of the band and the creation of this EP would be a disservice, as Kid606 has an impressive array of previous work and accolades. Suffice it to say, the artist has a long-standing reputation for creating music that pushes the envelope and challenges listeners in exciting ways.

""Pretty Girls Make Raves"" is certainly no exception to this rule. From the start, the album greets listeners with a melodious journey of synths, rhythm, and beats that seamlessly blend and transition into one another. The title track, ""Pretty Girls Make Raves,"" starts strong with a driving beat that gradually introduces more and more elements, creating a frenzy of sound that builds to a satisfying peak before melting away.

Other standout tracks include ""New Boss Same as Old Boss,"" which features a catchy beat and playful vocals that add a unique dimension to the overall sound. The final track, ""New Heavy,"" is a moodier and more introspective piece that provides a fitting end to the EP.

One thing that stands out to me about this album is the creativity and versatility in the instrumentation. The synths and beats weave together in complex but pleasing ways, offering plenty of sonic diversity for the listener to explore. The production is top-notch, with a clear attention to detail and an emphasis on making the most of the electronic elements.

Overall, I would recommend this EP to anyone interested in electronic music that offers something a little off the beaten path. Kid606 is a master at creating soundscapes that refuse to be easily categorized, and ""Pretty Girls Make Raves"" is no exception. While it may not be for everyone, for those who are willing to take a chance on something a little different, this EP is a rewarding listening experience.","1.

Fruit Tree Foundation,First Edition,"Folk/Country,Rock",5.9,July 21 2011,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"So what we have here is the Scottish indie version of ""We're All in the Same Gang"", a gathering of artists playing against type for a good cause. Originally an entrant in last year's Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival, First Edition put its roster up to the task of exploring appropriate lyrical themes. Where N.W.A and Ice-T once took on violence, here James Graham (the Twilight Sad), Emma Pollock (the Delgados), Rod Jones (Idlewild), and Scott Hutchison (Frightened Rabbit) come together to promote mental health. Good cause and intentions aside, there's an irony to this bunch working on such a project. The Delgados crafted their masterpiece in large part by living up to its title of Hate, two of Idlewild's biggest hits are ""Little Discourage"" and ""Live in a Hiding Place"", while Frightened Rabbit had to go ahead and put a song on their last record called ""Not Miserable"" because there's no way you'd assume the opposite was the case unless clearly notified. Fruit Tree Foundation is rounded out by relatively obscure (at least in the U.S.) singer-songwriter types like Alasdair Roberts, Jill O'Sullivan, and Jenny Reeve. And for the most part, the songs here gravitate more toward their low-key and affable folkiness than the highwire bloodletting of the aforementioned. Recorded in a mere five days, these are largely acoustic and almost entirely off-the-cuff, showing their moving parts in an almost aggressive way: A good number of songs here begin with in-studio chatter (somewhat stilted back-and-forth about Glasgow and such), push through verses and choruses over static riffs and chord changes like they're in the progress of being written, and wander off into noodly guitar solos. Undoubtedly, First Edition was a fun project to record and I'm sure a welcome relief for most of those involved to sidestep the heft and expectations associated with their day jobs of supervising emotional powder kegs. But while there's chemistry, there's little in the way of spark, and First Edition's good intentions add up to a record that doesn't do anything upsetting. And as such, it just feels like a misuse of resources. If nothing else, it's proof enough that these guys are masters of technique and timbre as vocalists, rather than just ones with a weapons-grade emotional arsenal. Graham's richly burnished low register in particular sounds fantastic simmering over acoustic dirges completely free of feedback, yet it's worrisome that without the guitar squall and tortured, punishing lyrics, the Twilight Sad could conceivably veer toward the maudlin tearjerkers of the Swell Season. Likewise, Pollock's contributions to co-ed bashers like ""Singing For Strangers"" recast her as a chipper cheerleader, a weirdly deferential step down from her wearied but wise counterpoint to Alun Woodward. The Graham feature ""Favourite Son"" puts lumbering drums right up in the mix like the Twilight Sad, and ""I Forgot the Fall"" retains Hutchison's unmistakably plaintive melodicism, but both lack a crucial element of catharsis. Within First Edition's context, Jones' ""All Gone But One"" is the hookiest and most forceful of the power-pop entries. Were it an Idlewild song, and it certainly could be, it would simply be a standard issue cut from one of their later LPs which found them getting less bookish and yet somehow also less edgy. Maybe my expectations are skewed, but in a situation such as this-- basically, a planned vacation from having to front such lyrically self-flagellating outfits-- you might figure it'd be embraced as on opportunity to take more chances both sonically and thematically. It's a nice enough listen and surely you'll come out of the purchase feeling much better about yourself (which is pretty much never the outcome upon listening to anything these guys have put their name on in the past). But ultimately, even the most rip-roaring of the bunch simply sounding like low-stakes versions of what we've grown accustomed to.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15613-first-edition/,Chemikal Underground,2011.0,"It's no secret that the Fruit Tree Foundation is a band that has invested a lot of time and effort into crafting their unique sound, and their latest album, 'First Edition,' is no exception. As a fan of both folk/country and rock music, I was curious to see how the band would mix these genres in one album. After listening to the album several times, I am happy to report that they did a great job of balancing the two styles and delivering a solid collection of tunes. 

Before we dive into the details of the album, let’s talk about the history of the band. Formed in 2007, the Fruit Tree Foundation is a supergroup that consists of six talented musicians from Scotland, including Rod Jones from Idlewild, Emma Pollock from The Delgadoes, and James Graham from The Twilight Sad. The band's main goal is to use their music to raise awareness for mental health issues and to provide support to those affected by them. 

The group's latest album, 'First Edition,' was conceived during a challenging period in the band members' lives, one in which they were all dealing with mental health struggles. Perhaps that is what gives the album a rawness and authenticity that I found particularly engaging. The album was recorded in various locations, including a beach house in Argyll and a church in Glasgow – and the varied recording locations add to the album's atmosphere. 

As soon as I hit play on the first track, ""Through The Round Window,"" I was hooked. The warm guitar strumming and harmonizing vocals lured me in, and the lyrics struck a chord with me. The song sets the tone for the rest of the album, which seamlessly transitions between bright and cheerful songs like ""Somewhere Else to Be"" to more somber tracks such as ""Ripples on the Lake.""  

While the album is a cohesive work in its own right, each track stands out with its own unique sound and emotional impact. The standout track for me was ""Our Day,"" which features the soulful voice of Zoee with delicate guitar work, creating a hauntingly beautiful sound. 

Overall, 'First Edition' is a strong release from Fruit Tree Foundation. While it may not be the band’s most groundbreaking album, it provides a dynamic and heartfelt listening experience that addresses important themes concerning mental health. The way the band interweaves the genres of country/folk and rock into something unique is impressive. 

Personally, as someone who has dealt with mental health struggles, I found myself relating to the album on a deeper level, and I applaud the Fruit Tree Foundation for their efforts in raising awareness about the issue while creating a beautiful soundtrack. In my opinion, 'First Edition' deserves a rating of 8 out of 10, and I would highly recommend giving it a listen.","1.

Classixx,Hanging Gardens,Electronic,7.8,May 31 2013,Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,"Los Angeles production duo Tyler Blake and Michael David achieved prominence through a constant presence on the internet remix circuit, but their tendency to reference and recontextualize runs deeper. Before the pair adopted the nostalgic-by-design Classixx moniker, they cranked out a few electro-chintz remixes as Young Americans, an assumed allusion to the classic David Bowie LP of the same name. The debut single from Blake's solo project Fingerpaint, last year's ""Lunar"", leaned heavily on a sample of Arthur Russell's ""This Is How We Walk on the Moon"". The cover of Classixx's debut LP, Hanging Gardens, is a double-vision homage to the sleeve for Tangerine Dream's 1988 album Optical Race, while its title track pilfers the melody of Fleetwood Mac's glistening Tango in the Night cut ""Seven Wonders"". Internet-age producers who frequently create with others' raw materials aren't necessarily guaranteed a similar level of success when left to create worthwhile music on their own-- take last year's debut album from mashup outfit the Hood Internet, the astoundingly tepid FEAT. With Hanging Gardens, Blake and David soar above any low expectations; they've put together a cohesive, impossibly lush record that pays adequate lip service to a variety of pop sounds while loading the decks with glossy, head-cleaning dance. Classixx remixes frequently possess the slick expansiveness of disco, with a touch of nocturnal mood-shading to boot. By contrast, Hanging Gardens is bright, warm, and breezy, and as the summertime approaches, its release couldn't have come at a better time. Classixx excel at creating a textured push-and-pull within the framework of their own productions, and Hanging Gardens provides several wordless moments to get lost in. Take the contemplative 4/4 of ""A Fax From the Beach"", which plays like a post-post-comedown sequel to Fred Falke's indelible, wistful 2008 single ""808 PM at the Beach""-- as well as a killer transition or two, like when the rollin'-and-scratchin' bump of ""Rhythm Santa Clara"" gently bleeds into the declarative synth stabs that open up ""Dominoes""' positive, propulsive Balearic structure. Album highlight ""Holding On"", meanwhile, elicits comparisons to Discovery-era Daft Punk, uncannily combining ""One More Time""'s repetitive pulse with the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed purity of ""Digital Love"". Classixx are very good producers-- their sonic excursions are placid and stylistically considered, with plenty of surface beauty, if not a ton of depth-- but the biggest surprise of Hanging Gardens is that they're great songwriters, too. It's astonishing how many of the guest appearances simply work, and in such a satisfying way, too: Take the all-caps kiss-off anthem ""All You're Waiting For"", featuring a typically tart vocal from ex-LCD Soundsystem member and DFA fixture Nancy Whang, and Sarah Chernoff's dizzying ""A Stranger Love"", reminiscent of Saint Etienne's glassy-eyed club gestures. Jesse Kivel of L.A. electro-pop duo Kisses does effective mush-mouthed romanticism all over the palm-muted synths of ""Borderline"", while chillwave castrato Pat Grossi (whose monastic Active Child project has benefitted from Classixx's touch before) does his weightless choirboy thing over the airy bells of ""Long Lost"", an ethereal R&B-leaning tune that's a silkier, less pathos-heavy version of what AC did on 2011's just-okay You Are All I See. The record's most potent punch, ironically, is more than three years old: ""I'll Get You"", which saw release as a single in 2009 on the waning tastemaker imprint Kitsuné, wields Jeppe's brash vocal beams as an effective weapon, as the former Junior Senior vocalist asks repeatedly and somewhat ridiculously, ""Do you like bass?"" It shouldn't work, but it does, and pretty well. More than anything else, the pure pop cuts on Hanging Gardens leave the listener wanting more, which is exactly the record's paradoxical flaw: although it runs to nearly an hour long, a good deal of space is relegated to the more instrumental cuts, which aren't quite distinctive enough to push the five-and-six-minute mark as they frequently do. The less impressive material loses its effectiveness when isolated from the sequencing of the album, which flows impressively as a front-to-back listen. Hanging Gardens is a decadent trifle to lose yourself in, a deceptively simple record that has the potential for great longevity.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18004-classixx-hanging-gardens/,Innovative Leisure,2013.0,"Hey there music lovers, I'm excited to share my thoughts on Classixx's album 'Hanging Gardens' with you. Let's dive into what makes this electronic gem so special.

First off, a bit of background on the band. Classixx is a Los Angeles-based electronic music duo comprised of Michael David and Tyler Blake. They formed in 2009 and gained recognition in the dance music scene with their remixes of tracks by artists like Passion Pit and Phoenix. 'Hanging Gardens' was their debut full-length album, released in 2013, after years of producing and touring.

From the very first track, 'Hanging Gardens' pulls you in with its smooth beats and dreamy synths. The album effortlessly blends elements of disco, house, and funk, creating a sound that's both nostalgic and innovative. It's an album that demands to be listened to from start to finish.

Personal favorites of mine are 'All You're Waiting For' featuring Nancy Whang, and 'Holding On' featuring vocals from indie-pop artist, Sarah Chernoff. These tracks showcase the duo's ability to craft infectious melodies with driving rhythms. They also highlight Classixx's collaborative spirit, incorporating unique and diverse vocal performances into their music.

'Hanging Gardens' is an album that's perfect for any occasion, whether it's a dance party or a chill night in. The standout tracks are contagious and will undoubtedly get you grooving. But there are also moments of introspection and reflection, particularly in tracks like 'Borderline' and 'Supernature'. It's a well-rounded collection of tracks that speaks to Classixx's versatility and range as electronic music producers.

To sum it up, 'Hanging Gardens' is an electronic masterpiece that deserves recognition for its unique soundscapes and mesmerizing beats. It's a testament to Classixx's talent and growth as artists, and I highly recommend this album to anyone looking to broaden their music tastes. I give it a solid rating of 7.8 out of 10.

Via Audio,Animalore,Rock,4.8,February 22 2010,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"Via Audio's band van has the word ""SNOB"" painted on its side in cartoonish block letters. The Brooklyn-based, Berklee-educated foursome surely aren't the only music lovers who self-identify that way these days-- even beyond their home borough. Based on the recent chart successes of Vampire Weekend, Grizzly Bear, and Animal Collective, a growing portion of U.S. record buyers now think a lot like critics. If widespread connoisseurship leads to more adventurousness inside and outside the mainstream, as Solange Knowles' Dirty Projectors cover or Antony Hegarty's Beyoncé cover appear to portend, then the stage could be set for some of the weirdest and most exciting pop in ages. As Animalore shows, however, the new snobbishness isn't always for the best. That's a shame, because the mature, earnestly proficient folk-pop of Via Audio's first LP, 2007's Say Something, was mild-mannered to a fault. Again produced by Spoon's Jim Eno, Animalore keeps its predecessor's smooth gloss and evident chops, demonstrating why Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla was an early supporter, but adds touches of funk, R&B, and cloying humor. With songwriting that veers between snoozy and face-palming, it's the kind of sophomore album that makes you question whether the debut deserved so much love in the first place. To paraphrase Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, true expertise is knowing there's a whole lot we don't know. For instance, I don't know how much it matters that Animalore shares its name with a rare 1953 ""animalanthology"" featuring Lewis Carroll. If there's a concept here, it's subtle: ""The Lizard Song"" ably ventures into tropicalia; ""Tigers"" rides an indie pop groove but catches its tapping toe on Mother Goose-like rhymes. Animalore's charms are subtle, too, but easier to find. Spoon's Eno establishes a dubby sense of space beginning with the jazzy chords and thick bass of coolly seductive opener ""Hello"". Co-songwriter Jessica Martins' light, versatile voice should please fans of former tourmates Headlights, particularly on acoustic-to-technicolor finale ""Happening""-- the album's best song. Martins also keeps the Fleetwood Mac-dreaming ""Summer Stars"" and castanets-kissed ""Wanted"" from collapsing underneath their complex arrangements. She can't save ""Goldrush"", which sounds like a 1970s-era ""Sesame Street"" ditty about the Olympics, but its hook should be sharp enough to catch some listeners. When Via Audio engage with recent chart pop, though, they bring an ironic distance that can be... off-putting. It's hard to imagine anyone would actually ""want to make babies"" to first mp3 ""Babies"", which turns the sci-fi synths and slinky rhythms of a Timbaland production into wry parody. ""Digital"" adopts the deadpan electro of LCD Soundsystem to broach the shocking revelation that pop stars use Auto-Tune: ""It doesn't even matter how good you are,"" co-songwriter Tom Deis sneers, aghast. It's sad and embarrassing hearing complaints about ""something 12-year-olds will like"" from a band that elsewhere sings, ""Olga, the poetry of music rises like the ashes of a life before I knew you."" As long as pop is going to encourage us would-be connoisseurs, here's hoping it doesn't forget about the 12-year-olds-- or the 17-year-olds, either.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13877-animalore/,Undertow,2010.0,"Via Audio's 'Animalore' is a fascinating dive into the Rock genre, earning itself a rating of 4.8 out of 10. Their sound is unique, blending a variety of influences to create an album that is both engaging and intriguing. It's clear from the very first listen that this is a band that knows how to work together to create something truly special.

Before delving into the album itself, it's worth taking a brief look at the history of Via Audio. The band hails from Brooklyn, NY and originally formed in 2003, driven by a shared passion for experimental and innovative music. Having released several EPs and full-length albums throughout the years, they have carved out a niche for themselves as a band that is fearless in pushing the boundaries of what rock music can sound like.

'Animalore', their most recent full-length album, is a testament to their unique approach. The album was recorded over a period of two years, with the band members working tirelessly to craft a sound that was both cohesive and distinctive. The result is a collection of tracks that feels at times like a sonic journey, taking listeners on a trip through the various creative influences that inform Via Audio's sound.

One of the standout tracks for me is ""Animalore"", the namesake of the album. This song opens with an intricate guitar riff that sets the tone for the rest of the track. There's a sense of urgency to the pace that makes it hard to sit still while listening. The bass and drums work in perfect tandem, providing a robust backbone for the layered guitars and vocals to weave in and out of. It's a multifaceted track that feels like the perfect summation of Via Audio's sound, highlighting their musical precision and experimental sensibilities.

Another standout track on the album is ""Babies in Your Dreams"". The opening guitar riff is reminiscent of the iconic '90s alternative rock sound, but the track quickly evolves into something entirely different. The arrangement is complex, featuring multiple interwoven guitar lines and a driving beat that will keep you nodding your head in time. The vocals are emotive, conveying a sense of longing and nostalgia that is hard to resist. It's a track that builds upon itself, drawing you in more and more as it progresses.

Overall, 'Animalore' is an album that deserves to be heard by anyone with an appreciation for innovative, experimental rock music. It's clear that Via Audio has put a great deal of thought and effort into crafting something unique, and the result is an album that is nuanced and engaging from start to finish. While I personally would rate it a bit higher than 4.8 out of 10, I understand that everyone's taste in music is different. That being said, I would highly recommend giving this album a listen and experiencing it for yourself.","1.

DIANA,Perpetual Surrender,,7.0,August 23 2013,Renato Pagnani,Contributor,"DIANA began after another project that Toronto artists Joseph Shabason (whom you might recognize as the guy blowing saxophone all over Destroyer's Kaputt) and Kieran Adams had intended to work on fell through, leaving them with a bunch of studio time and Rural Alberta Advantage producer Roger Leavens at their disposal. Unsatisfied with demos that featured their own vocals, they eventually reached out to Carmen Elle, a friend who had toiled around the local music scene for years, playing guitar with Austra and fronting her own garage-rock duo, Army Girls. Almost immediately she became a full-time member of the group, assuming all of the band's vocal responsibilities, and the decision to bring her in pays out dividends on their full-length debut, Perpetual Surrender, a confident collection of vaseline-smeared synth-pop that marries chillwave atmospherics with strong songwriting. Let's address the chillwave thing first-- yes, there are a lot of aquamarine environments to get lost in on Perpetual Surrender, and yes, it's unafraid of pushing Elle's vocals so deep into the mix that it sounds like she's singing from the other side of a wall, but it does so with a panache that never forgets that this sort of thing can also knock the air out of your stomach when done right. A lot of the credit goes to Leavens, who proves himself an instinctive producer that knows when to keep adding and when to pull back and let things breathe. ""Foreign Installation"", for instance, is shrouded in a pre-dawn fog that calcifies into a black mass of a chorus before dissipating back into a fine mist. And then there's ""Strange Attraction"", where clanging percussion leads the way forward as much as the track's approaching-storm bass. He even manages to help turn the saxophone solo of the title track into one of the album's most rewarding moments, earning it with a keen ear for structure that finds the band more often than not placing sounds where they'll achieve maximum impact. An emphasis on lower frequencies gives Perpetual Surrender a surprising heft in addition to its lush Balearic sprawl; it ends up a sturdier incarnation of a sound often charged with lacking bite. There are basslines that not only approach funky but actually deserve the adjective, producing a physicality that only someone who knows just how valuable a rhythm section can be to a band is capable of conjuring. When DIANA clear everything out, they're just as effective: ""New House"" is the album's sparsest moment, consisting of nothing more than moaning floorboards and intermittent bass, and it shines the spotlight on an affecting vocal performance from Elle, who effortless toggles between been-hurt-before reticence (""Am I just another thing to use, grow tired of, and throw away?"") and empathetic reassurance (""Baby, I know you're terrified""). It bowls you over with gentle-but-firm encouragement. As much credit as DIANA deserve for their ability to create texture, Perpetual Surrender is first and foremost a pop record, and it's most successful when it plays up this ambition. Its songs-- mostly tales of romantic uncertainty aimed inward rather than outward-- were all written by Shabason and Adams, who have a knack for large earwormy hooks. The type of vocalist whose voice actually sounds better the harder it's pushed, Elle imbues these songs with a lived-in intimacy that belies the fact she didn't have a hand in penning them herself. ""Now's the time for believing/ Lay your hands on me, I need healing"" she sings on ""Born Again"", bestowing carnal relations with the power of spiritual purification. It's the album's best song, possessing a widescreen romanticism that the rest of the album can't quite duplicate elsewhere. A general wobbliness pervades the album, and there are places where it might benefit DIANA to zoom further out and sharpen their focus. Case in point: the album-closing instrumental ""Curtains"" is entirely inessential, aiming for epic but barely achieving consciousness. This sense that DIANA are still figuring out how to best fit together the pieces they've got to work with serves as a reminder that Perpetual Surrender is a debut record-- a very compelling one, but a debut nonetheless. Now that Elle is a full-time member, it will be interesting to hear how their eventual follow-up differs in its songwriting, given that she does wonders with the material here. There are enough explosive moments to suggest that DIANA have another gear to explore.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18424-diana-perpetual-surrender/,"Jagjaguwar,Paper Bag",2013.0,"Canadian synth-pop band DIANA returns with their debut album ""Perpetual Surrender,"" showcasing a unique blend of dreamy soundscapes and melancholic songwriting. With a rating of 7.0 out of 10, this album is definitely worth checking out for any fans of the nan genre who are searching for music that challenges them while still remaining easy to listen to.

The story of DIANA began back in 2012 when the band's founding members, Joseph Shabason and Kieran Adams, began working on a side project to explore a more electronic sound. After recruiting vocalist Carmen Elle, the trio then began their journey towards creating ""Perpetual Surrender."" Their approach to songwriting was a collaborative effort, with each member bringing their own unique experiences and perspectives to the table.

The album opens with the title track, ""Perpetual Surrender,"" which immediately sets the tone for the rest of the record. Elle's ethereal vocals float atop a steady beat and a lush wash of synthesizers, creating an atmospheric sound reminiscent of some of the best dream-pop bands of the 80s and 90s. From there, the album takes the listener on a journey through a variety of moods and tempos.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""New House,"" which features a more upbeat tempo and catchy hooks. While it's still unmistakably DIANA, the track leans a bit more towards the pop side, making it an easy way to lure in new listeners. ""Born Again"" is another standout track, featuring an infectious melody and a bouncy rhythm that will have listeners hooked from the first few notes.

One of the things that I appreciate most about this album is its attention to detail. The layers of synthesizers, shimmering guitar lines, and subtle effects all blend together to create a lush and immersive listening experience. At times, it can be overwhelming - in a good way - as the album offers a lot to absorb in a single listen.

If I had to sum up ""Perpetual Surrender"" in one word, it would be ""introspective."" The album is contemplative and deeply personal, with lyrics that touch on themes of love, loss, and self-discovery. While some of the melodies and hooks might be ear-catching, it's the emotion behind the music that truly makes it stand out. Listening to this album feels like peeking into the inner workings of DIANA's collective psyche.

In conclusion, ""Perpetual Surrender"" is a strong debut from DIANA that showcases the band's penchant for moody, dreamy soundscapes and introspective songwriting. While it might not be for everyone, those who appreciate synth-pop music that challenges the listener while still remaining accessible will find a lot to love here. The album's attention to detail and emotional depth make it an experience that demands repeated listens and rewards those who dive deeper into its world.","1.

Napalm Death,Apex Predator - Easy Meat,Metal,7.9,January 28 2015,Zoe Camp,Contributor,"Napalm Death are one of the most virulent bands in metal: the legendary UK grindcore crew's violent, stream-of-consciousness operates like a punk pandemic. Fed by the cesspools of unrest and corruption in the world, their inspiration flares up and runs wild, feeding off whatever styles are at the ready. Sometimes their visceral sound skews hardcore punk, and sometimes it's more death-metal influenced. On any given record, the approach largely depends on how they approach their muses—the scum of the earth—and fortunately for their fans, there's plenty of scum to be found in today's state of affairs. Despite some early instability in their ranks—particularly between when they got their start in 1981 and 1992’s landmark album *Utopia Banished—*and the continued procession of new bands on the block, Napalm Death haven’t relented one bit. If anything, their path of destruction has grown ever wider, fueled, as always, by the grotesque workings of the musical and political communities that surround them, drawn increasingly closer together by the mores of the digital age. The band's most recent effort, 2012’s Utilitarian, ripped apart these themes at length, and longtime vocalist Barney Greenway and company’s new album Apex Predator - Easy Meat is similarly strident in its determination to keep the listening experience kinetically satisfying and altogether disgusting. Three decades in, Napalm Death’s famously mercurial lineup has solidified into a concise unit: guitarist Mitch Harris, bassist (and longest tenured member) Shane Embury, drummer Danny Herrera, and that maniacal frontman Mark ""Barney"" Greenway. Embury and Herrera are the whiplash-inducing back end, hammering out tempos atop which Harris proudly stands and slashes, bolstering his dissonant chords with high-register yelps and screeches. And, even at 45, Greenway's role as vocal juggernaut remains secure as he continues to gleefully shove aside whatever structures his bandmates assemble in his path. On Apex Predator, Russ Russell’s mixing allows you to catch every strain, every gasp, every last drop of spit. From the way Greenway huffs and puffs on ""How the Years Condemn"", you’d think the guy was the Big Bad Wolf’s cousin from a nuclear dystopia. A closer look at Embury's lyrics reveals instead an ordinary man, haunted by the friends he's lost and desperate to better his life so as not to sully their memory. Napalm Death's splatterhouse hijinks are rooted in a more profound sense of psychological pain this time around, and that their ability to convey that pain hinges largely on its voice. What’s more, he remains capable of embodying a dizzying number of roles, adopting the cadence of a murderous carnival barker one moment (on ""Smash a Single Digit"" and ""Metaphorically Screw You"") and an unholy clergy member the next (the title track, an almost meditational nod to Swans). Don’t come into this thing expecting a solo spree; aside from John ""Bilbo"" Cook’s delicious guest riff on ""Hierarchies"" (touted humorously in the liner notes as the ""token guitar solo""), the axework on Apex Predator - Easy Meat skews workmanlike, with Harris welding together hardcore punk, chaotic, hyper-speed grindcore, and just a hint of groove metal to make the acrid medicine go down smoother. Way back in the mothball-scented archives of YouTube there’s this old TV interview with Jim Carrey in which he half-seriously declares his allegiance to thrash metal, launching into an impassioned parody of Napalm Death. ""Some day, this guy’s gonna wanna slow down and do some duets,"" he grins, launching into a simulation of what that might sound like. What's crazy is that Carrey's mockery ended up being half fulfilled. On Apex Predator, Napalm Death have scaled back the mach-speed sections of yore, specifically with regards to the drums, and the album does feature a screamed duet of sorts with the shattered dialogue of ""Beyond the Pale"". What’s more, as on 2012's Utilitarian and in other scattered corners of their discography, there are periods of clean singing that would've seemed unthinkable back in the days of Harmony Corruption. Here, it's more interestingly interwoven than in the past. And it’s still a Napalm Death record through and through—which means shredded eardrums and tinnitus for days. After all this time, we’d expect nothing less.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20116-apex-predator-easy-meat/,Century Media,2015.0,"Are you ready for the sonic assault that is Napalm Death's ""Apex Predator - Easy Meat?"" This album is an absolute masterpiece for the metal genre, showcasing the band's ferocious power and intense musicianship. With a rating of 7.9 out of 10, it's clear that fans and critics alike have been blown away by this album.

But before we dive into the music itself, let's take a step back and examine the history of the band. Napalm Death formed in Birmingham, England in 1981, and has been a staple of the metal scene ever since. Over the years, the band has undergone several lineup changes and experimented with different styles, but their commitment to crushing riffs and brutal lyrics has remained constant.

""Apex Predator - Easy Meat"" was released in 2015, and represents the band's fifteenth studio album. The album was recorded in four different countries, with each member contributing tracks remotely and then coming together to finalize the project. The result is a cohesive and dynamic album that perfectly blends different elements of the metal genre.

But enough about the history - let's talk about the music itself. From the opening seconds of ""Apex Predator - Easy Meat"", it's clear that this is a Napalm Death album through and through. The tracks are fast, heavy, and unrelenting, with each member contributing to the overall sound in unique and exciting ways. There are moments of technical virtuosity, such as the intricate guitar work on ""Dear Slum Landlord"", as well as moments of crushing simplicity, such as the pounding beat on ""How The Years Condemn.""

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Metaphorically Screaming"", which features a blistering pace and intense vocal delivery. The lyrics are classic Napalm Death, exploring themes of social injustice and political corruption with a sharp wit and a ferocious anger. The band's commitment to these issues is part of what has made them such an enduring act in the metal scene, and ""Apex Predator - Easy Meat"" is no exception.

In my opinion, ""Apex Predator - Easy Meat"" is one of Napalm Death's strongest albums to date. The passion and intensity that the band brings to their music is palpable throughout, and each track feels like a perfectly crafted piece of art. Whether you're a diehard Napalm Death fan or simply a casual metal listener, this album is definitely worth checking out. So turn up the volume, let the riffs wash over you, and prepare to be blown away by one of the most powerful bands in the game.","Step 1: Both reviews provide background information on Napalm Death, but Review B goes into more detail about the band's history and discography, making it more likely to be the human written review.

Flying Lotus,Cosmogramma,Electronic,8.8,May 6 2010,Joe Colly,Contributor,"Talking to us over the summer about his then-forthcoming album, Steven Ellison said he felt like he was progressing as a producer. ""I'm finally getting to the point where I can make the kind of records... that I wanted to make when I was younger, things that I dreamed about making,"" he told us. That sounds modest-- he's been persistently pursuing a singular vision for years now-- but his first two albums did share common traits with his forebears. Even the excellent Los Angeles from 2008 took some of its cues from J Dilla, one of Ellison's idols. But with Cosmogramma, it's not enough anymore to talk about Ellison's sound as ""post-Dilla"" or even ""post hip-hop."" It's his sound now. Indeed, Cosmogramma is an intricate, challenging record that fuses his loves-- jazz, hip-hop, videogame sounds, IDM-- into something unique. It's an album in the truest sense. Even on Los Angeles, which hung together well as a full-length, there were moments you could pick out as singles or highlights-- the distorted pop of ""Camel"" or the maniacal electro-house of ""Parisian Goldfish"". But Cosmogramma is conceived as a movement-- bits of one song spill into the next, and its individual tracks make the most sense in the context of what surrounds them. In this sense, it feels almost like an avant-garde jazz piece, and so it takes more than a few listens to sink in-- one or two spins and you're still at the tip of the iceberg. Jazz is a big influence on the record, and it's a good place to start talking about the individual sections that make up the whole. Ellison is, of course, the nephew of jazz great Alice Coltrane and has said in interviews that his albums are in part dedicated to her. That's clear on Cosmogramma, as there are distinct passages that pursue an elaborate kind of digital jazz and the album is constructed to move through different sections, as one of Coltrane's might. There are roughly three of these passages-- the first is an aggressive three-song suite based loosely on videogame sounds. On ""Nose Art"", FlyLo puts raygun squiggles alongside woozy synths, grinding mechanical noises, and about 10 other sonic elements. Like much of the album, it sounds almost frustratingly unstable until you hear it a few times and the pieces begin to interlock and congeal. True to its title, Cosmogramma then moves through a heady astral stretch and finally a more downtempo jazz-heavy period. The latter partly serves as a necessary breather from the complicated sounds earlier on. FlyLo shows ridiculous talent in each section-- the things he can do with and to beats just aren't common. In ""Zodiac Shit"", he makes a heavy, loping bass thump sputter out on cue, creating a physical rumbling quality. The beat of ""Computer Face // Pure Being"" trips over itself again and again like clothes tumbling in a dryer. These aren't just tricks-- in each case they push the song toward a groove. And it's not just beats: ""Satelllliiiiiiite"" is as dreamy as anything FlyLo's done to date, its distorted vocal samples and steam-building arrangement not unlike something out of Burial's repertoire and frankly just as good. The song that will likely get the most attention here is ""...And the World Laughs With You"", a collaboration with Thom Yorke. Obviously an electronic-music fan, Yorke has done these guest spots before (for Modeselektor and others) and with such a high-profile contributor it's easy to make the song all about him. But FlyLo doesn't pay Yorke any undue deference, just treats his vocals like another element to manipulate and weave into the mix. It's so subtle, in fact, that if you're not paying close attention you might miss his appearance altogether. It's this level of confidence and commitment to his vision that ultimately makes Cosmogramma so fascinating. FlyLo is working at the height of his creative powers right now, and the scary thing is it's reasonable to think he could get better.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14198-cosmogramma/,Warp,2010.0,"When it comes to electronic music, few names carry as much weight as Flying Lotus. The Los Angeles-based producer is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and forward-thinking artists of his generation, with a production style that defies categorization and a discography that consistently pushes the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of electronic soundscapes. His 2010 opus, ""Cosmogramma,"" is perhaps the most impressive display of his virtuosic talents to date, a thrilling journey through a universe of glitchy beats, cosmic textures, and otherworldly melodies.

To understand the magnitude of ""Cosmogramma,"" it's worth exploring a bit of Flying Lotus' backstory. Born Steven Ellison, the artist is the nephew of jazz legends John and Alice Coltrane, and he grew up surrounded by the sounds of improvisation and experimentation. After studying film at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, Ellison eventually found his way to the world of music production, where he quickly made a name for himself as a boundary-pushing innovator.

""Cosmogramma"" was created in the aftermath of two tragedies in Flying Lotus' life: the death of his mother and the suicide of his friend and collaborator, fellow beatmaker Dilla. These losses loomed heavily over the making of the album, and you can feel the weight of that grief in every note. But rather than wallowing in sadness, Flying Lotus channels his pain into something transcendent, creating a work of art that feels like it's reaching for the cosmos.

From the opening bars of ""Clock Catcher,"" it's clear that ""Cosmogramma"" is going to be a sonic adventure unlike anything you've heard before. The song's spiraling melodies, stuttering drums, and glitched-out vocal samples are a dizzying introduction to the album's eclectic soundworld. From there, the album takes you on a journey through a kaleidoscope of textures and moods, from the jittery, sci-fi bounce of ""Pickled!"" to the ethereal, harp-laced beauty of ""...And The World Laughs With You.""

As an electronic music fan, I've always admired Flying Lotus' ability to evoke a sense of otherness in his music. ""Cosmogramma"" takes that aesthetic to another level, creating a sonic realm that feels truly alien at times. The way the producer manipulates sound, bending and warping it into new shapes and dimensions, is awe-inspiring. There's a sense of playfulness here, too, with Flying Lotus using unexpected rhythms and off-kilter beats to keep you on your toes.

All that said, ""Cosmogramma"" isn't just a display of technical prowess. There's an emotional depth here that's rare in electronic music. The album feels like Flying Lotus' attempt to make sense of a world that can be cruel and chaotic, and there are moments of genuine beauty and hope here that are all the more striking for their contrast with the album's darker moments. The closing track, ""Galaxy In Janaki,"" is a stunning example of this, a soaring, cosmic journey that feels like a cathartic release after the tumult of the previous tracks.

All in all, ""Cosmogramma"" is a masterpiece of electronic music that stands as a testament to Flying Lotus' singular vision and artistic ambition. It's a challenging, occasionally disorienting listen, but it's also an incredibly rewarding one that reveals new layers with each spin. Even a decade after its release, it remains one of the most boundary-pushing albums in the electronic canon, and a true triumph of the human spirit. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves music that pushes the limits of what's possible.","1.

Various Artists,Guilt by Association,,5.1,August 30 2007,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"Do guilty pleasures even exist anymore? It seems like everything, no matter how reviled, can be argued as legitimate and meaningful with varying sincerity and irony ratios. After all, Justin ""N'Sync"" Timberlake (deservedly) scored Pitchfork's top single of 2006, and last week Chris Dahlen interviewed Daryl Hall. Maybe you scoff, but guilt is totally subjective: What shames one listener may be openly admired by another. Besides, pleasure is pleasure, whether you find it in Rock Plaza Central, New Young Pony Club, R. Kelly, or Sixpence None the Richer. Maybe it's just a misnomer: A guilty pleasure might just be a song that doesn't conform to your typical listening habits, in which case it can become an important horizon expander. If that happens, though, the song also becomes an integral part of those same listening habits. My (admittedly anecdotal) evidence: Not too long ago, I read a blog entry on guilty pleasures, and the comments section quickly became a very intense game of one-upmanship as readers proudly announced their own guilty pleasures. Where was the guilt in all the grandstanding? Into this forum steps New York City's Engine Room Recordings, which spent three years coaxing 15 indie artists into covering their own guilty pleasures. The long-in-the-making album is called Guilt by Association, and the covers are as dubious as that title. Either by design or by accident, the compilation seems to define the term as anything that is not white, male, hetero indie rock, revealing the casual elitism in the idea that one style of music is somehow more legitimate than another. Nobody's covering Har Mar Superstar here, although more than a few acts manage to turn 1970s rock or contemporary r&b into white, male, hetero indie rock. Apologies to Superchunk, but is ""Say My Name"" really a guilty pleasure? Do we need a folksy ""sensitive"" reading of System of a Down's ""Chop Suey"" to convince us that headbangers might have something interesting to say? Guilt by Association is just a strange collection of songs, with curious highs and lows that make it sound like an update on early 90s comps like Super Fantastic Mega Smash Hits or Star Power! (on which artists rescued songs like ""I'm Not in Love"" and ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia"" from K-Tel obscurity). The highs include Goat's take on ""Sugar, We're Going Down"", the disc's most recent source material and emo's sole representative, even if his quieter, mock-serious arrangement manages to sap some of the self-satisfaction from Fall Out Boy's lyrics. Luna reinterprets Paula Abdul's ultimatum ""Straight Up"" as a desperately co-dependent anthem, and Devendra Banhart grafts bossa nova rhythms to Oasis' ""Don't Look Back in Anger"", making it so coyly seductive that the original seems comparatively hamfisted. Between this and his version of Antony's ""Fistful of Love"", Banhart might consider a covers album next. The comp's best track, though, is its first: Petra Haden's inventive reconsideration of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"". ""The Sopranos"" may have forever lifted it out of a cheeseball ghetto it never deserved, but Haden's version, recorded before the series ended, joyfully re-creates the song through multi-tracked, a cappella vocalizations (her duel guitars are the clincher) that are downright affectionate, preserving the song's rock'n'roll romance even as she breaks into Wilson Phillips' ""Hold On"" during the outro. But amazingly, Guilt by Association doesn't hold onto that feeling and actually stops believin'. For every spirited rendition here, there's an uninspired run-through or an apathetic rehash. Mark Mulcahy makes ""From This Moment On"" sound safe for Starbucks everywhere; Jim O'Rourke just makes the Spice Girls' ""Viva Forever"" sound dour; and the Mooney Suzuki's retread of ""Just Like Jesse James"" goes limp without Cher's theatricality. Eddie Money's ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" gets the folksy treatment from Karate frontman Geoff Farina, totally destroying the original's sense of ""speeding down the highway with the windows rolled down"" freedom. Not even bothering to meet the song halfway, his version embodies the compilation's most discouraging problem: Risking so little adventurousness or unpredictability, too many of these artists really do sound like they feel guilty.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10592-guilt-by-association/,Engine Room,2007.0,"If you're a fan of the Nan music genre, then you're in for a unique treat with the album ""Guilt by Association"" by Various Artists. While the genre may not be everyone's cup of tea, this album is still worth a listen, if only to expand your musical horizons.

First, let's delve into the history of the artists on this album. The collection of artists featured on ""Guilt by Association"" come from various backgrounds and musical styles, truly embodying the spirit of collaboration. The album was created as a tribute to the guilty pleasures of pop music, featuring covers of songs that most would not expect these artists to tackle. From rock legends like Joan Jett covering ""Love Is All Around"" to indie favorites The Dresden Dolls taking on ""My Heart Will Go On,"" there is a diverse mix of artists and songs featured on this album.

Despite their differing styles and backgrounds, all of the artists come together on this album to perfectly execute a cohesive sound. This is not your typical polished pop album; it's gritty and raw, with a live sound that makes it feel like you're experiencing a concert in person. The Nan genre may not be mainstream, but that only adds to the charm and authenticity of ""Guilt by Association.""

One standout track on the album is ""Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)"" by Corn Mo. The song starts off with a slow and melancholic melody, but quickly ramps up to a roaring chorus with powerful vocals that will have you singing along. Another notable track is ""Don't Stop Believin'"" by Caleb Hines. This classic rock anthem is given a unique twist with Hines' haunting vocals and stripped-down instrumental accompaniment.

While the album does have its high points, there are also some tracks that don't quite hit the mark. The vocals on ""Maniac"" by The Dresden Dolls can be grating at times, and ""I Will Survive"" by Cake comes off as uninspired and lackluster compared to the original.

In conclusion, ""Guilt by Association"" is an album that’s worth giving a listen, whether you're a die-hard fan of the Nan genre or just looking for something new and unexpected. While not every track is a hit, the diverse mix of artists and songs on this album is sure to keep your attention throughout. So, put on your headphones and let the gritty, live sound of this album transport you to a new and fascinating musical world.","1.

Clark,Clark,Electronic,8.3,November 7 2014,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"The world is ending, and Chris Clark is writing its soundtrack. In the 35-year-old electronic producer’s latest dystopian vision, the Earth’s layers peel back with painstaking certainty while everything else bursts and pops in unrest. Temperatures flash between frostbite and flame. There are moments of unsettling calm, only to be ruptured by bruised sky, acid rain, famine, disease. Unknown beings attack, armed with tones set to bewilder. Somewhere, the sound of a muffled Billie Holiday acetate being mauled by a pack of lions echoes through the murk. There is last-chance dancing—or are those people just running away? As far as end-times scenarios go, the one Clark sets forth on his eponymous seventh album is vivid. And while there’s plenty of terror to be found here, Clark resonates because it pinpoints both the humanity and the nothingness that come along with complete dread; he knows that in order for annihilation to mean anything, you have to care about what’s being annihilated. Because for every laser-burned bass kick and alien-probe synth, forces of good cautiously look out from the rubble in the form of twinkling lullabies and melancholic piano loops. In cinematic sci-fi terms—and it’s hard not to think of this record as a kind of headphone IMAX experience—Clark is more akin to Alfonso Cuarón’s devastating infertility parable Children of Men than, say, Independence Day: ominous because its pulse feels all too real. At this point, Clark has been translating his wracked emotions via machines—samplers, software, synths—for about half his life, and Clark has him merging techno, electro, noise, classical, ambient, and post-rock with the skill of a virtuoso. Growing up just outside of London, he indulged in nascent omnivorous Internet-era listening habits, giving time to indie rap, Pavement, and Squarepusher as a teen before Warp deemed him next-in-line to their mindful electronic throne at the start of this century. Though it was probably unfair to expect Clark to live up to the legacies of Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, it was also inevitable. But with his third album, 2006’s Body Riddle, he quietly did just that, turning in an opus that moved the sounds of Warp’s classic 1990s roster forward, mixing sensuousness and mechanics to create a 21st century cyborg touchstone. Owing to the mercurial nature of his tracks, which often morph unexpectedly many times across just a few minutes, follow-up Turning Dragon was nearly as excellent but utterly different, trading in spectral atmosphere and hip-hop rhythms for a more full-on techno thrust. And after five years of frustratingly diffuse material that had the producer grasping at new styles and textures with mixed success, Clark is a much-welcomed return that locates the midpoint between Body Riddle’s tangibility and Turning Dragon’s bulletproof sheen. The album adds a fresh layer of grandiosity that hints at festival-sized dance music or even Trent Reznor’s churning soundtrack work while never bowing down to any type of current trend. Clark is like Aphex’s comeback Syro in that it showcases a veteran artist living and breathing within a sonic space of his own creation—and the fact that no one would confuse the two records is a testament to Clark’s hard-won individuality. What’s always set Clark apart is his eclecticism, dynamism, and flair for the dramatic, all of which is on fine display here. His tracks don’t drop as much as they slip or swerve, forever off-balance. He’ll end a techno album with eight minutes of beatless, sky-cracking ecstasy you’d expect to find on a Sigur Rós LP, and it will make sense. He’s allergic to the idea of standard sounds and presets, which is partly why we’re still talking about him 13 years after his debut. And unlike many of his more insular peers, Clark can be open to sentimentality—not schmaltz as much as a belief in humanness and all its inexact wonder. In electronic music’s never-ending battle between man and machine, he’s seeking a third way. “It's just far too easy these days,” he said in an interview earlier this year, talking about the copy-and-paste replicability of so much modern composition. “I'm often inspired by the path of most resistance. Looking for those tiny snippets of error—machines being pushed into areas of behavior that seem wrong and unusable. There is real fruit there.” Rather than fighting the SoundCloud hivemind with real people playing real instruments, à la Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories, he composed Clark largely on a computer by himself in a barn in the middle of the English countryside, cracking codes and inflicting glitches. As computerized watches and glasses inch toward ubiquity, this idea of subverting machines to make them more human seems like a particularly worthy preservation strategy—and nobody does that quite like Clark. Yes, he makes music that sounds like the end of the world. But he also makes you want to live long enough to see what that will look like.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19905-clark-clark/,Warp,2014.0,"When you hear a Clark album, it's like you're diving headfirst into a swirling vortex of electronic sound, and his self-titled release ""Clark"" is no exception. With a rating of 8.3 out of 10, this album captures the edgy and experimental nature of electronica that the artist is known for.

Clark is a British electronic artist, whose music is defined by an intuitive exploration of sound. From his beginnings in the experimental and avant-garde scene to his current status as a cult electronic artist, Clark has always been an innovator, pushing boundaries and challenging listeners with his blend of techno, IDM, and experimental influences.

Now, with his self-titled album release ""Clark,"" the artist takes his sound to the next level. This album feels like a sonic journey through the depths of a dark electronic landscape, with glitches and unusual sounds weaving in and out of the mix. But this isn't just mindless noise; each track is carefully crafted, with a precise balance of melody, rhythm, and texture.

There's a real sense of intensity and purpose to this album, as if every sound has been carefully placed and engineered to evoke an emotional response. The album opener, ""Ship Is Flooding,"" is a great example of this, with its frenetic drum patterns and glitchy samples that slowly and steadily build into an eerie and hypnotic melody. It's a track that really gets under your skin and sets the tone for the rest of the album.

""Model City,"" another standout track, is a bit more upbeat, with a driving rhythm and a melody that's both catchy and haunting. The way in which the track blends organic and synthetic sounds is particularly impressive – it's difficult to tell where the samples end and the live instruments begin.

One of the factors that makes ""Clark"" stand out is its use of space – there's a real sense of depth and atmosphere to the album, as if you're listening to music that's somehow bigger than the sum of its parts. Each track feels like a journey in and of itself, with a unique sonic palette that draws you in and keeps you hooked. It's an immersive listening experience that's hard to shake off.

Overall, ""Clark"" is a triumph for the British electronic artist, showcasing his ability to create music that's both experimental and accessible. It's a great example of the kind of forward-thinking electronic music that's pushing the genre in new and exciting directions. Whether you're a seasoned electronica head or a newcomer to the scene, this album is definitely worth checking out.","1.

Jeff Mangum,"Orange Twin Field Works, Vol. 1",Rock,8.5,July 9 2002,David M. Pecoraro,,"As frontman for what was arguably one of the most admired psychedelic pop bands of the last decade, and as the primary creative force behind two of the most admired indie rock albums ever, Jeff Mangum's decision to put his work with Neutral Milk Hotel on the backburner (some suspect permanently) came as a surprise to music fans everywhere. Even more shocking to many was what followed: a trip to Europe and the announcement of a new project. Titled Orange Twin Field Works, Volume One, Mangum's newest work has none of the precisely layered instrumentation or eminently empathetic lyricism of Mangum's earlier work. In fact, Mangum's distinctive, shaky voice is nowhere to be found. That's right, Orange Twin Field Works is just what it claims to be: a collection of field recordings made by Mangum during his travels of Europe. And this may be surprising to some. But it shouldn't be. While Mangum's fellow Elephant 6 chums were busy taking inspiration from the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Zombies and their ilk, Mangum was peppering his work with bagpipes, tape loops, singing saws, and a whole slew of other instruments and sounds too bizarre too identify-- yet he always made them easy to identify with. When one takes into account both Mangum's ability to present atypical musical ideas to typical American audiences, and his seeming desire to push the limits of his form, the contents of Orange Twin Field Works make perfect sense. The music of Bulgaria is actually the amalgamation of the native music of a handful of tribes that first settled the land in the seventh century. By traditional Western Music standards, it has an incredibly unique sound. It's performed largely with strings, wind instruments and vocals; made up of asymmetrical structures, dueling vocal parts, and time signatures some of us would call awkward even after spending the better part of the 90s marinating in math-rock. For hundreds of years, this strange music has evolved, all the while playing an almost crucial part in the lives of many Bulgarians; it accompanies everything from work to dining to relaxation. The annual festival which Mangum documents here lasts three days and nights, generally draws over 20,000 singers, dancers and players, and over 200,000 captive witnesses to the town of Koprivshtitsa. Mangum does more here than just present the music at hand. Given the important role it played in the development of modern Western Music (Bulgaria was playing around with stuff like 5/16 time signatures centuries before most notable European Composers ever walked the earth), compilations of Bulgarian music are fairly easy to come by. So rather than rehash the same ol' same ol', Mangum makes a point of assembling these sounds in such a way that it might make sense to typical American ears. These recordings are presented as one long track, with songs blending not only into one another, but also into sounds of traffic, the conversation of onlookers, the whooshing of the wind. Clearly, Mangum wants his listeners to feel as though they're experiencing something as magical as what he experienced, and not just listening to 'another CD.' Orange Twin Field Works couldn't sound less like Neutral Milk Hotel if it tried, but much of it is curiously on par with some of Mangum's best work, despite that the only instrument he plays here is the record button. When you listen, keep in mind that there's a reason Mangum was driven to the Balkan Peninsula by this stuff. There's something in this music that mattered to him, some quality so distinct he felt it must be captured and exposed to a culture that would otherwise have no access to it. Some of the best music produced by the Western world-- from Louis Armstrong's ""St. Louis Blues"" to even Neutral Milk Hotel's ""Ghost""-- stems not only from the musicians letting go and having fun, but from the musicians openly communicating that joy to the listener. And the people making the music on Orange Twin Field Works are obviously having a blast. Mangum may never make another Neutral Milk Hotel record, and instead dedicate himself to field recordings (he's considering traveling to Romania for Orange Twin, Volume 2), playing back-up in his friends' bands, and working on John Oswald-style sound collages that no one but his close friends may ever get to hear (check the Pitchfork interview and marvel at the very idea). But perhaps that's what he needs to do, for himself. And this is why Mangum is a consummate artist. He realizing that producing the material others want and expect from him isn't always what's best for him. Sometimes the most important thing an artist can do-- both for himself and for his work-- is to halt everything and take a chance, to step back, to observe, and to learn. Perhaps we would be wise as listeners to step back and learn with him.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5069-orange-twin-field-works-vol-1/,Orange Twin,2001.0,"It's always a momentous occasion when Jeff Mangum releases any new material, and Orange Twin Field Works, Vol. 1 is no exception. Mangum, the frontman of Neutral Milk Hotel, has been relatively inactive since the release of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, an iconic album that enthralled music enthusiasts everywhere with its heart-on-sleeve lyrics and obscure instrumentation.

Now, nearly two decades later, Mangum returns with an album that features experimental rock, field recordings, and spoken word pieces. It’s a hodgepodge of different styles and sounds woven together seamlessly to create a fresh and exciting listening experience.

The album's creation story is a fascinating one. Mangum worked with the Orange Twin Conservation Community, a nature reserve in Georgia, to make the record. It features field recordings that were sourced from the reserve's surroundings, adding a layer of authentic natural ambiance to the already eclectic soundscapes.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Whistle Peel,"" which opens with a flurry of disorienting notes before settling into a wistful and at times unsettling guitar riff. Meanwhile, ""August Song,"" a spoken word piece, is a haunting meditation on mortality and the passage of time.

In contrast to these darker moments, there are uplifting and joyful tracks, such as ""Sunflower River Blues,"" which features jubilant fingerpicking and an overall sense of warmth and optimism. 

As a longtime fan of Neutral Milk Hotel, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation as I sat down to listen to Orange Twin Field Works, Vol. 1. And I was not disappointed – the album is a compelling and rewarding listen from start to finish. The band's signature sound, with its blend of folk, rock, and psychedelic influences, is still very much present, but now it's imbued with a sense of experimentation and exploration that sets it apart from their earlier work.

Overall, I would give Orange Twin Field Works, Vol. 1 a rating of 8.5 out of 10. It's an album that rewards and demands multiple listens, and each time I listen to it, I discover something new and awe-inspiring. It's a testament to Jeff Mangum's craftsmanship as a musician and his ability to create music that is both personal and universal. I can't wait to see what he does next.","1.

Trembling Blue Stars,The Seven Autumn Flowers,Rock,5.5,May 3 2005,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"On balance, Trembling Blue Stars are best at cranking out filler by the slop bucketload and placing it between two or maybe (if we're lucky) three maddeningly great songs. In 2015, a compilation of their highlights will be worth buying. In 2005, their albums really aren't, unless you have a big place in your heart for Bob Wratten's super-fey indie pop and that place wasn't already filled by his work with Field Mice. It should be noted that everything on this album sounds nice; it's well-recorded, well-mixed, well-performed-- hell, it's even well-packaged-- but it has little spark and a bad habit of insisting on five-minute songs. Wratten and friends make listening a chore with crawling, dull songs like ""One Prayer Answere"", a drag with cello, acoustic guitar and sleepy, barely melodic vocals. There are a lot of songs here like this, and I'd say they formed the backbone of this album, if this album had any backbone at all. Like I said earlier, the highlights are quite bright, but there are just a few of them in the offing and outside of these sparkling moments, it's strictly bedtime. It took me a few listens to realize that ""Last Port of Call"" is a pretty nice song, surrounded as it is by its drag-ass cousins, but its laid-back lilt and memorable melody make it stand out-- even if it is twice as long as it should be. ""Helen Reddy"" gets things started with a sweet fake-out, sweeping along at a swift tempo with the sweet vocals of a bandmember credited only as Beth leading the way-- it almost reminds me of Pale Saints, actually, and it got me excited for what was to follow. I should have known better, because Wratten pulled this exact trick on the last TBS album, Alive to Every Smile, leading off with a stunner only to retreat to somnambulant quietude on the rest of the disc. ""The Sea Is So Quiet"" also picks up the pace and is similarly rewarding-- Wratten's melodies aren't exactly hook-laden, so sometimes it takes a snappy drum beat and some chorused guitar to drive them home, which is the case here. Two of the four songs tacked on after the album's proper running order (it's telling that they're referred to as ""extra tracks"" and not ""bonus tracks"") seem to realize this, but by then, the album's runtime has bloated to an arduous 75 minutes. These songs all feel like they should burst and go somewhere, but none of them do. Even a sense of economy-- say, allowing no song to last more than the two or three minutes-- could have improved this, but by the time I get a third of the way through, all I want to do is stop listening to it. Wait 'til 2015.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8149-the-seven-autumn-flowers/,Bar/None,2005.0,"If you're a fan of rock music, chances are you've heard of Trembling Blue Stars. Known for their dreamy, melancholic sound, this indie rock band has been making music since the mid-90s, and their latest album, 'The Seven Autumn Flowers' is as beautiful and poignant as ever.

Let's start by delving into the band's history. Trembling Blue Stars was formed by Bob Wratten, who was formerly a part of The Field Mice - another popular indie rock group from the UK. After the disbandment of The Field Mice, Wratten went on to form Trembling Blue Stars, and over the years, their sound has evolved to incorporate elements of shoegaze and dream pop, making for a unique and emotive listening experience.

'The Seven Autumn Flowers' was released in 2003, and was the band's fifth studio album overall. This record was created during a time of intense upheaval in Wratten's personal life - his father had passed away not long before the album's release, and the lyrics on the record reflect his grief and search for meaning in the wake of his loss.

As for my personal experience with this album - I have to say that it's one of my favorites from Trembling Blue Stars. From the opening chords of ""Sometimes I Still Feel the Bruise"" to the haunting melody of ""Dark Eyes,"" the music on this record is both intricate and soothing. Wratten's introspective lyrics cut deep, and are perfectly complemented by the lush instrumentation of the band.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""The Ghost of an Unkissed Kiss."" This song is a testament to the band's ability to create a sense of longing and nostalgia through their music. Wratten's vocals are gentle and hypnotic, while the intricate guitar work and dreamy synthesizers add to the sense of atmosphere and mood.

Overall, I would give 'The Seven Autumn Flowers' a solid 7 out of 10. While the record may not be as instantly catchy as some of the band's earlier work, the depth of emotion and thought put into each song make this album a rewarding and poignant listening experience.

In conclusion, Trembling Blue Stars continues to be a standout in the indie rock world, and 'The Seven Autumn Flowers' is a testament to the band's ability to create music that is simultaneously beautiful and heartbreaking. Give this album a listen, and let yourself be transported to a world of dreamy introspection and ethereal melodies.","Step by step reasoning: 

- Review A mentions the album being not worth buying unless you have a big place in your heart for Bob Wratten's super-fey indie pop and that place wasn't already filled by his work with Field Mice. Review B, on the other hand, gives a brief history of the band, its evolution and the album's creation.
- Review A contains negative criticism about the album's length, lack of spark, and insistence on five-minute songs, while Review B is more positive, describing the music as beautiful and poignant.
- Review A has a casual tone with informal language like ""slop bucketload"" and ""drag-ass cousins,"" while Review B has a more objective and formal tone.
- Review A is more critical of specific songs on the album, while Review B focuses on the overall emotional experience and a few standout tracks.
- Based on the above reasoning, it is likely that Review A was generated by a model and Review B was written by a human.

Lakutis,Three Seashells,Rap,6.7,March 6 2014,Zach Kelly,Contributor,"Read anything about Washington Heights-bred MC and Das Racist (R.I.P.) affiliate Lakutis (Aleksey Weintraub), and one word seems to pop up with alarming regularity: Dirtbag. Known more for his party animal persona than this rapping, he certainly looks the part, like the gold-toothed, frequently shirtless offspring of Ted Nugent. Dirtbag or no, he's an eccentric for sure, evidenced on Sit Down, Man-era features like ""Amazing"", which showcased his heavy-lidded but zealous flow. Though his appearances alongside the DR boys felt a bit like charity (or maybe it was because he just felt like one smartass too many), he fared a little better on his own. His 2012 I'm in the Forest EP found him trying to find his voice in the New York weirdo party rap community, druggily reinterpreting Ja Rule and Ashanti's ""Put It On Me"", dropping smart-dumb non-sequiters (""Chilean with miners but I'm major""), and even offering a few choice tracks (""Lakutis in the House""). Two years later, Lakutis is back with his pay-what-you-want full-length debut 3 Seashells. Still prone to fits of bizarre leftfield humor, 3 Seashells reigns the focus in and unveils a darker, more unhinged version of a man who now compulsively refers to himself as ""skeleton"" (he pronounces it ""skell-a-tawn""). A few months ago, Lakutis offered up the single ""Jesus Piece"", accompanied by a Tarsem-esque video that found him fighting through a nosebleed and getting covered in gold paint. Nothing too original in the visual department, but the track itself—dystopic, sludge-y, and queasy to the point of needing a Dramamine—felt ahead of the curve. And it's a good way into 3 Seashells, which feels like its been informed by horrorcore and Wu-Tang in equal measure. It's a record that suggests the person who made it spends more time listening to rap music than actually making it, a paranoid loner with a baggie of bad acid trying to translate a stack of classic 90s New York hip-hop records in his basement. Save for a feature from DVS, Lakutis is on his own here, making an unsubtle statement of independence. Instead, it just sounds like he's scared all of his friends away. Tracks are short and punchy, operating like mini exorcisms or kooky freestyle templates. And while he's still prone to boneheaded provocation—""Skeleton"" sounds like a booty bass track whacked-out on PCP, complete with howling and babbling; ""Mumra"" is a dirge-y black magic chant*—3 Seashells* reinvents the rapper without skimping on the details that made him oddly compelling in the first place. Part of this has to do with the production. Helmed by a stable of relative unknowns, the beats on 3 Seashells feel cypher-ready but take on more experimental shapes, favoring caustic sounds that give off an eerie, unpredictable impression. SicksentZ's ""Black Swann"" sound like a washing machine with a cinderblock in it trying to recreate the drums on ""Loser""; Bill Ding's ""Dope As Fuck"" (which feels like a companion piece to A$AP Ferg's ""Dump Dump"") is draped in haunted moans; a creeped out Eastern mystic vibe undercuts Spvce's ""Mumra"". More traditional compositions fit in nicely as well, like previous Lakutis collaborator Steel Tipped Dove's opening two contributions, like the smoker-friendly ""Animal"" or the headknock throwback ""What the Fuck"". Even the goofy lover's rock of ""Body Scream"" manages to charm. But if you're coming to 3 Seashells looking for bars, it's best to look elsewhere. Lakutis isn't big on coherent content, favoring a sort of stream of consciousness approach to his rhyming. Granted, 3 Seashells doesn't stray too far from your run of the mill rap hedonism. But his trademark wisecracking is also present, referring to himself at one point as ""Tombstone Pizza Pierre"". Other times, he waxes Rust Cohle, like on ""Jesus Piece"" (""Look at the fuck have you done/ Made a world where father doesn't know his son/ But the drugs let the child know god if he want""). Lakutis' real strong suit is the way he raps, punctuating words with a visceral intensity usually reserved for the frontman of a hardcore band, his flow almost functioning as a percussive element. 3 Seashells was slated to come out late last year, but was pushed back a couple times, with Lakutis repeatedly promising on Twitter that it would be ready any minute. With this in mind, the album feels a little rushed, and for such a short ride (12 tracks, only three of which scrape the three minute mark, including two brief in-jokes masquerading as skits), there's one or two too many missed targets. Coupled with Lakutis' nagging need to freak out the squares at nearly every turn, 3 Seashells is more promising than anything else.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18881-lakutis-three-seashells/,Greedhead,2013.0,"If you are a fan of underground rap music, you may be familiar with the name Lakutis. This Queens-based rapper has been in the game for over a decade now, collaborating with other members of the independent rap scene such as Das Racist and Despot. And just recently, Lakutis released his latest album, 'Three Seashells'.

The first thing that grabbed my attention about this album was its production quality. The crisp beats and distorted synths provide a perfect backdrop for Lakutis' unique vocal delivery, which ranges from manic to lethargic. As you listen, you can hear the influence of '90s alternative rock and punk, which is an interesting twist on the typical rap sound.

One thing that I loved about this album was its cohesiveness. Each song flows seamlessly into the next, creating a sonic journey that takes you through Lakutis' mind. The themes of the album are heavy and introspective, dealing with topics such as death, addiction, and mental health. This sincerity and vulnerability make for a refreshing change of pace from the surface level braggadocio that often dominates the mainstream rap scene.

I particularly enjoyed the track ""So Daffy"", which features a catchy hook and poignant lyrics about Lakutis' struggles with addiction. The song ""Wrong Tree"" is another standout, with its haunting guitar riff and honest verses about trying to find one's place in the world.

Overall, 'Three Seashells' by Lakutis is a solid effort that showcases the rapper's growth and evolution as an artist. While not every track is a hit, the album is a cohesive and thoughtful piece of work that is sure to appeal to fans of underground rap. I would rate this album a 6.7 out of 10, for its unique sound, strong production, and genuine lyrics. If you're looking for something different in the rap genre, definitely give 'Three Seashells' a listen.","1. Review A has a more colloquial tone, using phrases and language that are less formal.

The-Dream,Love King,Pop/R&B,8.6,July 13 2010,David Drake,Contributor,"The-Dream earned his respect as a songwriter who co-wrote larger-than-life pop anthems, penning ""Umbrella"" for Rihanna and ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" for BeyoncÃ©, as well as less-known but evocative tracks for everyone from Usher (""Trading Places"") to Rick Ross (""All I Really Want""). His solo debut, 2007's Love/Hate, broke through with minor hits ""Shawty Is Da Shit"" and ""Falsetto"", whose wildly addictive hooks papered over his slight persona. The rest of that record created a constellation of characteristics that laid out his aesthetic-- the lush production courtesy of beatmakers L.O.S. and Tricky Stewart, songs that wash into each other in the mode of a DJ mix to create a miniature suite with precision sequencing. On Love vs. Money, The-Dream's second LP, he tried to replicate this effect. Although the epic sweep of the second album's final third was The-Dream at a songwriting peak, the front-loaded pop songs-- particularly ""Walking on the Moon""'s thin attempt at literal transcendence-- felt like shadows of past achievements. Even so, it was another vital chapter in an unusual career, as The-Dream has balanced the mercenary hit-making obsessions of his peers with the tender loving care of an auteur working out a unified statement. Love King, the alleged final chapter in his Love Trilogy, is the thrilling conclusion to his three-album arc. If you've been charmed by The-Dream's strengths-- Tin Pan Alley song concepts and an unceasing sense of musical craft-- then you'll be immensely satisfied with the music here. The record argues for The-Dream's identity as an album artist whose tics and stylistic effects have created a self-sustaining world of distinctive R&B, and in a style that proudly wears its influences on its sleeve. As a debut single, ""Love King"" felt like a cobbled-together collection of these attributes: the expected ""radio killa"" ad-libs, self-mythologizing, and hooks with familiar insistence. But it turned out to be a pump fake, because here it makes for a great table-setting opener. Love King builds on Love/Hate and Love vs. Money by indulging in emotional and melodic excess. The-Dream knows where to find the sweet spot, and he has an uncanny knack for how pieces of music fit together. When a song would be best served by space, he gives it plenty. Every piano chord and finger snap and bass hit is in its right place. He sweats every detail but never loses sight of how the album works as a whole. ""Yamaha"", the most immediately powerful track on the record, is one example of what he does so well. It pushes The-Dream's earlier Prince nod ""Fast Car"" even further in the direction of outright imitation, with searing hooks, nakedly lustful appeals, and an arrangement and instrumentation that pay homage to the R&B of the early 1980s. As the song unwinds, you feel like you're sharing the songwriter's love of this music, and marveling at the way that he absorbs it into his own aesthetic. The following ""Nikki Part 2"", emerging from the twinkling synths of ""Yamaha"", keeps the run going, the melancholy of the verses ultimately finding transcendent emotional recognition when the song opens on the chorus. And then the urgent drama of ""Abyss"", a perfect title for a song that feels like an emotional freefall, completes the mid-album triptych, its epic chorus evoking a cold-water plunge of claustrophobic betrayal. These highly charged moments are balanced by more understated tracks. ""Turnt Out"" is The-Dream at his easiest and most likable, and it's one of the album's few moments of restraint. Meanwhile, ""February Love"" turns Love vs. Money fan favorite ""Fancy"" from a grandiose statement to a more intimate memory. The-Dream's debut had the advantage of appearing in a vacuum, enabling him to balance his traditional songwriting impulses with a unique creative approach. Once it became apparent that the latter direction had garnered him a loyal following, the pressure to give more generously to that audience led to an imbalance on Love vs. Money. With Love King, it no longer feels as if he's splitting the difference between his pop star ambition and a large cult of admirers. By breaking down the detachment that made him such a popular songwriter to follow his personal musical vision, and it's taken him to a place only he could find.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14449-love-king/,Def Jam,2010.0,"When it comes to crafting infectious, genre-bending pop and R&B jams, there's no one quite as talented and daring as The-Dream. With his latest album, ""Love King,"" the hitmaker proves that he's not afraid to take risks and push boundaries, delivering an electrifying 12-track collection that's both smooth and sultry, and packed with some of the most memorable hooks and melodies you'll hear all year.

For those who are new to The-Dream's oeuvre, it's worth noting that the Georgia-born singer, songwriter, and producer has had a storied and influential career in the music industry. He's written and produced hits for Beyoncé, Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Mariah Carey, and countless others, earning a reputation as one of the most sought-after and innovative collaborators in the game.

But on ""Love King,"" The-Dream takes center stage and proves that his own artistry is just as compelling and essential as that of the artists he's worked with. From the opening track, ""Love King,"" which boasts a pulsating, club-ready beat and some of the singer's most seductive vocals yet, to the celebratory ""Yamaha,"" a standout track that sees The-Dream flexing his falsetto over a frenetic, guitar-driven groove, this album is a masterclass in modern pop and R&B songwriting.

One of the most striking things about ""Love King"" is the way The-Dream combines different eras and sounds to create something that feels fresh, but also deeply rooted in the history of black music. On standout tracks like ""Abyss,"" which features a gorgeous string arrangement that wouldn't be out of place on a classic soul record, and ""Make Up Bag,"" a duet with T.I. that channels the spirit of classic Motown ballads, The-Dream manages to pay homage to the past while also moving boldly into the future.

What makes ""Love King"" particularly brilliant, though, is the way it balances its more adventurous and experimental moments with pure, unadulterated pop perfection. Songs like ""Florida University"" and ""Sex Intelligent (Remix)"" are the kind of jams that will have you dancing in your seat, thanks to their irresistible beats and catchy choruses. Meanwhile, slower tracks like ""Nikki Part 2"" and ""Veteran"" showcase The-Dream's gift for crafting emotionally resonant ballads that tug at the heartstrings.

Overall, ""Love King"" is a triumph for The-Dream, and a testament to his long-standing status as one of the most innovative and exciting artists working in the music industry today. It's an album that rewards repeated listens, revealing new layers of melody and meaning with each spin. If you're a fan of pop, R&B, or just great music in general, you owe it to yourself to give ""Love King"" a listen. Trust me, you won't regret it.","1.

Boldy James,Grand Quarters,Rap,7.3,March 12 2013,Renato Pagnani,Contributor,"Last year's Consignment: Favor for a Favor, the Redi-Rock Mixtape from Detroit rapper Boldy James managed to keep you invested for its entire 26-track, hour-plus runtime. Sometimes the beats didn't line up with the quality of his rapping. Sometimes he tried to wear a lothario's robes instead of playing to his hard-nosed blue-collar strengths. But Boldy's presence was reason enough not to skip ahead. He spends most of his time detailing the intricacies of selling cocaine and raps with a numbed monotone, and he's the kind of rapper who boasts of his product's popularity while looking over his shoulder, afraid of being usurped by a younger version of himself. But he manages to be someone you root for. Boldy's new EP, Grand Quarters, gathers songs from the last few years and adds new material. Half the tracks are produced by Chuck Inglish of the Cool Kids, whose minimalist knock meshes well with Boldy's gritty, no-frills style. Inglish's work is more black-marker outlines than finished watercolors, and his beats are some of his hardest yet, stripped down and hollowed out to their most elemental parts-- usually, just granite blocks of bass, cavern-sized drums, and simple synth lines to provide some color. ""Gettin' Flicked"" finds a second home here after first appearing on the 2010 Cool Kids mixtape Tacklebox, and surrounded by other tracks similar in aesthetic, it's even more effective. Woozy synths approximate police car sirens, and Boldy crafts a tight narrative in which, after being released from jail, he goes straight back to the only life he knows. It's packed with details that give it a lived-in feel, like the fact his Air Jordan XII sneakers don't have any laces or that it was his aunts Lynnette and Marsha who accepted his collect call when he was arrested. The broken-subwoofer thump of ""For the Birds""-- the only one of the three Inglish-produced tracks not to have been released in some form before-- frees Boldy to dig into the corners of the track as he expands on slang for a brick of cocaine into a track's worth of fowl-inspired drug talk. Because they leave so much room for him to maneuver, these tracks serve as an excellent introduction for those unfamiliar with Boldy. The wide-open spaces highlight how flexible of a rapper he is, how much energy he can inject into a tightly-coiled style. His raps aren't quite melodic, but they possess a musicality that keeps them engaging. The new tracks further highlight that flexibility. ""Come Here"" is bombastic and celebratory, radio-friendly without sacrificing Boldy's idiosyncrasies-- the song even finds him trying on Auto-Tune for size, and thankfully it's more Future than Rebirth-era Lil Wayne. ""I Can Pull It Off"" is probably the most melodic production Boldy has ever rapped over, a shimmering tapestry of adrenaline-soaked synths with a sticky hook to match. Because it repurposes older material, Grand Quarters feels like a stopgap release more than anything else, a lead-in to Boldy's forthcoming Alchemist-produced album, scheduled for later this year. The outlines of two diverging courses for Boldy's career are plotted here. But given Alchemist's noir-ish take on classic New York boom-bap and ""Power Glove"", their collaboration from last year's Russian Roulette, it's likely that the album will hew closer to spacious, harder-hitting sound of the first half. But Boldy's surprising range here suggests that he'll be ready for whatever comes.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17798-boldy-james-grand-quarters/,Decon,2013.0,"If you're looking for something fresh, unique and introspective, then Boldy James' newest offering, Grand Quarters, may be your cup of tea. The album takes listeners on an immersive journey through the eyes of the Detroit rapper.

Boldy James may not be a household name, but he has been honing his craft for over a decade. An affiliate of the esteemed Griselda Records, James has been churning out quality music for years. The raw and gritty storytelling style that he's become known for comes through in spades on Grand Quarters.

The album itself was birthed out of a trying time in James' life. The passing of his mother and brother weighed heavily on him, and he found solace in expressing his grief through music. The creative process was a cathartic journey for James, and this is evident in the passion with which he delivers each line.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Brick Van Exel."" It's a tribute to an old friend who died from a drug overdose, and it's not hard to feel the pain and sorrow in James' voice as he recalls fond memories of their friendship. Similarly, ""Monte Cristo"" features James delving into his recent struggles with drug addiction and the negative impact it has had on his life.

Overall, the album is a reflection of Boldy James' growth and evolution as an artist. His pen game has always been sharp, but now he is more vulnerable and honest. It's clear that James has entered a new phase in his life and is determined to push himself creatively.

From a production standpoint, the beats are heavy and reflective of the rawness of James' lyrics. The instrumentals on ""On Ten"" and ""Cartier"" are particularly standout tracks, with their eerie melodies and banging drums.

In terms of criticisms, there are some moments that feel a bit repetitive, and the album can seem bleak and heavy-handed at times. However, if you're looking for introspection and reflection, and can appreciate the raw, gritty style of rap that Boldy James embodies, then this album is definitely worth a listen.

In conclusion, Boldy James' Grand Quarters is a testament to the emotional depth and growth of the Detroit rapper. Through his honest and introspective lyrics, James takes listeners on a journey through the highs and lows of his life. Though it may not be for everyone, for those who connect with James' style, this album is a must-listen. I'd give it a respectable 7.3 out of 10.","1.

No Age,An Object,Rock,6.2,August 20 2013,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"An Object is protest music. Though their crusade is more principled than political, No Age employ a common countercultural tactic on their third proper LP, reappropriating a derogatory term: what are you calling an object? This is art, with an intrinsic value that cannot be quantified or commoditized and society is worse off when any record is treated differently. But the irony is that it's a clever marketing tactic whether intentional or not; No Age’s music, successful as it’s been, never tells their whole story. Whether it’s the Smell, the T-shirts, the ""planned contradictory action,"" Dean Spunt’s Post-Present Medium label, or anything else bearing their imprimatur, the band’s always been a multimedia affair. They are a bundle of righteous affiliations, “lifestyle music” for people who shudder at the term because their lifestyle is an ethos, upholding certain ideas about DIY, local scenes and anti-corporatism. When speaking to us earlier this year, Randy Randall promised a total teardown and the time did feel right for the duo to sell high on the “dream-punk” sound they’ve cultivated since Weirdo Rippers. Strikingly spare compared to their previous releases, An Object ensures the shortest distance between the listener and the songs, but with an idealistic corollary that still momentarily shifts the focus away from the music-- with Sub Pop’s blessing, the duo packaged and shipped the record with their own four hands. But what’s left of No Age when you take away the “dream-“ and “-punk”? An Object proves that all the reverb, shrieking noise, and velocity of their past work were hardly afterthoughts or subversive tactics to disguise pop songs. They were essential and the actual mechanics of songwriting-- melody, harmony, structure, instrumental chops-- are exposed on An Object as something that’s far down the list of No Age’s strengths. You sense that in the three year hiatus between Everything in Between and now, the songs came quickly and most of the time was spent painstakingly turning them inside out-- to mute the drums or excise them completely, use feedback as a backdrop rather than an overlay, to turn rhythms into melody, bass into treble. This is the album that might’ve better earned the title Everything in Between, as the songs are composed of scraps, MacGyver tricks achieved with contact mics, bass guitars, and doctored amps. Occasionally, the effort manifests in notable progress. “An Impression” has a novel rhythmic swing that could actually pass for dancehall and the miniature bumps and bleeps bleed into sighing strings-- it’s No Age’s most typical “pretty” moment, something that could sway people who don’t seek out beauty in harmonic feedback. But for the most part, An Object consists of potential rock songs denied everything they need to actually rock*.* The minimalism doesn’t make for a fighting trim No Age-- they sound emaciated, subject to a crash diet equally fueled by asceticism and stubbornness. None of which is helped by the clammy production, which casts a green-grey, sickly pallor over An Object rather than clarity. On past records, Spunt’s rigid vocals could most kindly be described as “effective in context,” but freed from the obligations of beating the shit out of his drums, he shrinks in the spotlight. There aren’t vocal melodies on An Object, so much as 11 iterations of one note being budged until it moves in the slightest one way or the other. Meanwhile, Randall forgoes riffs for granular, ephemeral textures and rather than building tension through restraint, the lack of rhythmic, tonal or melodic variation causes the album’s midsection to drone more than their past work which intended to be drone music. No Age attempt to compensate by making An Object their most lyrically direct album, and at the outset, most of Spunt’s words are pointed towards “you.” You know who “you” are-- “Who do you think you are/ trying so hard/ to make that stage/ but it’s not made that way,” “When I see you/ underneath your lies,” “You’re a broken leg/ a knife with no blade.” It’s “us vs. the man, maaaan” boilerplate for sure, though the generality can work in the favor of a band that’s always had a cause but not much of a rallying cry. When Spunt sings “I won’t be your generator/ you get no power from me,” odds are it’s a bird flip to corporations who co-opt underground art, gentrify scenes, and buy out idealism, or whatever. But if you don’t know the first thing about No Age’s extracurriculars, “I Won’t Be Your Generator” is a multi-purpose rager at parents, bosses, boyfriends, girlfriends, whatever’s harshing your buzz. Much like ditching the drums, it’s an obdurate artistic move that’s effective three minutes at a time. But when a band that’s taken up the role of indie’s moral compass gets stuck in the same black and white thinking on “No Ground” and “C’mon, Stimmung”, the pervasive “you” becomes a strawman version of actual No Age enemies like Kings of Leon and Walmart-- certainly worthy of derision, but too big to bother fighting back in a way that might put those principles to the test. As An Object trudges forward, a strange and welcome change slowly occurs; you can sense No Age growing fatigued enough to let their guard down. After spending the first half of An Object raging against shadowy power brokers, they’ve retained their autonomy only to find out they can’t outrun their own shadows. “Running From A-Go-Go” is the first point where the drab tone matches the mood; when Spunt complains about “bullshit on the stereo,” he’s probably not taking shots at Imagine Dragons or Macklemore or anyone else specific. It’s just a mundane acknowledgement of a touring musician’s crippling boredom, abject, incapacitating loneliness and how inadequate the moral high ground from earlier can be against emotional encroachment--  “There’s no escaping when it pays your way/ I tell myself it’s one more day/ and one more night alone again.” On Nouns, Spunt shouted “with passion, it’s true!” So does the pervasive disillusionment of An Object make it false? Of course, not-- the subjects at hand are taken straight from Spunt and Randall’s lives, they've never dealt in fictional songwriting. But perhaps it’s too real, as you get the sense that the hot-button topics that can sustain a punk rocker through their 20s-- art vs. commerce, stability vs. freedom, underground vs. mainstream-- eventually grow tiresome and repetitive and best left to those who have the time and energy for endless debate. That doesn’t mean these conversations shouldn’t happen and perhaps An Object can spark a few. But as a musical document more utile and enjoyable as a conversation piece than for its intended purpose of listening, An Object sadly lives up to its own name.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18325-no-age-an-object/,Sub Pop,2013.0,"An Object by No Age: A Dynamic Exploration of Sound

No Age returns with their fifth studio album, An Object, offering a captivating and eclectic array of sounds that showcases their distinct style. With a rating of 6.2 out of 10, this record leaves a lot of room for interpretation and growth.

The band's history is rooted in the DIY punk ethos of the mid-2000s, and their unique blend of experimental noise and dreamy punk pop has made them a mainstay in the indie scene. An Object was self-produced and recorded in the band's practice space, emphasizing their signature DIY approach. This gave them the freedom to experiment and take risks, leading to a final product that is raw, gritty, and filled with bold sonic choices.

The album begins with the track ""No Ground,"" which opens with a blast of static noise and rapidly transitions into a post-punk guitar riff. The band showcases their trademark blend of soaring melodies, frenetic distortion, and noise-punk elements throughout the album. Each track moves with distinctiveness and focus, weaving together an intricate and dynamic soundscape that immerses the listener in a world of sonic experimentation.

One standout track on this record would be ""An Impression."" This powerhouse of a song boasts a driving energy that is relentless and unwavering. The guitar riff is incredibly subtle but intensely catchy, immediately leaving an impression on the listener that they wouldn't forget anytime soon. This track also features well-crafted vocal harmonies that add a layer of richness to the soundscape.

While the sound and lyrics are impressive, there are occasionally moments where the album feels lacking in emotional depth. It feels as though they were more focused on creating a cohesive sound throughout the album, rather than on individual tracks that can standout on their own.

All in all, An Object is a courageous and bold effort from No Age. The band's commitment to their DIY ethos adds a certain authenticity to the raw energy and passion of their sound, making this album an intriguing listen. With this release, they have once again reminded us of their ability to offer unexpected twists and turns within the genre. But at the same time, it left me wanting a bit more depth in the songs. An Object is definitely worth exploring, however, and should be added to your music playlist of experimental rock.","1.

Baby Elephant,Turn My Teeth Up!,Pop/R&B,7.0,October 15 2007,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"While West Coast hip-hop producers capitalized on rap's compatibility with late-period Parliament-Funkadelic to the point where it wound up defining the whole region's sound from Del to Dre to Digital Underground, it was New York's Paul Huston who became one of the first to harness the Mothership's energy for a bonafide classic. Without Bernie Worrell's squealing synths, lifted expertly from Funkadelic's '79 jam ""(Not Just) Knee Deep"", De La Soul's Prince Paul-produced 1989 hit ""Me, Myself and I"" wouldn't have been remotely as memorable. And by the time 1991's De La Soul Is Dead was released, with the sparse piano melodies from Funkadelic's ""I'll Stay"" woven into ""Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa"" and flashes of the synth from Parliament's ""Flash Light"" appearing in ""Shwingalokate"", it was clear that Paul had a certain affinity for Worrell's keyboard work. That's an easy enough explanation for why the Paul-Worrell collaboration Turn My Teeth Up! works better than both Handsome Boy Modeling School albums, the Dix, or any of the other all-star projects Huston's been involved in since he wrapped the classic A Prince Among Thieves in 1999: Paul isn't too intent on making the signature style of one of P-Funk's most important sonic architects any more outlandish than it really needs to be. But Baby Elephant is a surprising collaborative effort: aside from the obligatory skits and a solid framework of straightforward beats, the vast majority of the record's immediacy flows through Worrell, and he delivers the same kind of mad-scientist liveliness that made his work so vital in the 1970s. And, let's face it, past that: this is a funk project, but it's one that tweaks the idea of funk as of-its-time sample-fodder, turning it back around into a sort of hip-hop-consuming everygroove. The context in which it dredges up Worrell's past mentors, collaborators and disciples-- George Clinton, David Byrne, Digital Underground's Shock G-- makes everyone involved sound oddly ageless, even when we recognize the voices from two or three decades past. Clinton's the most obvious touchstone, and the tracks where he appears have a couple obvious P-Funk tropes, tying funk into a sort of universal divine futuristic creation mythos and rolling out moments of endearingly goofy love jonesing. But it sounds disconnected from any 90s throwback obviousness, almost a minimalist revamp of the Mothership sound (or at least as minimalist as a drum break and an armada of synths and pianos and organs can be). And the range that Worrell shows in his technique-- transitioning the melody and the bassline from post-Forbidden Planet sci-fi synths to classically-trained Chopinisms to Ellington swing in ""Baby Elephants-n-Thangs"" and laying down a trans-blues skulk in ""Scratchinatanitchouttareach""-- keeps his sound as unpredictably catchy as anything Clinton sang over since Computer Games. The other guests play towards their strengths, David Byrne wailing over the martial rhythm and anxious finger-twitching melodies of ""How Does the Brain Wave?"" and Shock G in Humpty Hump mode burbling entertaining incoherence over the panicking-Meters workout of ""Plainfield""-- familiar schticks in appropriately bewildering contexts. Prince Paul doesn't have an immediately obvious hand in the way the album's shaped; anyone expecting a series of intricately-assembled samples on this record is going to be let down, though hey, he does have his trademark skits. (Most of them are dedicated to positing Worrell as some sort of incredibly influential guru-- no argument there; in the ideal world where keyboards are as highly esteemed as guitars the man would be Hendrix and a half.) But if you've heard Prince Paul's work with Gravediggaz or some of the more out-there surrealist moments on solo records like 1996's Psychoanalysis (What Is It?) and 2005's Itstrumental, you might recognize some of the darkly comic, borderline-sociopathologic touches that tended to lurk in his catalogue outside the Steely Dan and Hall & Oates loops he crafted for De La. Aside the funk-by-numbers (albeit prime numbers) of ""Fred Berry"" and the title track's swampy, denture-clacking groove, a great deal of Turn My Teeth Up! puts together perplexing juxtapositions that entertain through sheer bizarreness: the production on ""Crack Addicts in Love"" is as polished and radio-ready as any Rihanna or Amerie single, but the stark lyrics that Nona Hendryx sings over it (""in every moment that we live/everything we have to sell and give/our love, our blood/for another chance of getting high"") are only pretty in the delivery, while ""Skippin Stonze"" pushes the voice of onetime Worrell/Les Claypool/Buckethead collaborator Gabby La La into a distorted, eerie cry that seems to melt directly into the circuit boards of Bernie's synth. And the snarling electronic doom-metal drone of ""Even Stranger"" is just straight-up diabolical-- someone tell Bernie about this El-P kid; they could get along famously. When it doesn't work, Turn My Teeth Up! staggers into turf that's too goofy for its own good: even with Yellowman holding court, the cod-reggae ""Cool Runnins"" sounds a bit too hacky-sack, and Reggie Watts' fast-talking, attention-monopolizing player hater/ladies' man schtick on ""If U Don't Wanna Dance"" is funny exactly once (plus, c'mon, who wants to hear Worrell imitate Roger Troutman?). When it does work, though, it's an ideal dose of funk weirdness, so deep it's gone past the knees and all the way up to the brain.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10723-turn-my-teeth-up/,Godforsaken Music,2007.0,"If you're a fan of pop and R&B, odds are Baby Elephant's 'Turn My Teeth Up!' will be turning up the volume on your playlists. This genre-blending album easily earns a rating of 7 out of 10, thanks to its bold experimentation with diverse rhythms, grooves and melodies that breathes some fresh air into this crowded music scene.

Before we dive into the tracks, allow me to give you a little background information about the band. Baby Elephant is the brainchild of Prince Paul, Don Newkirk, and Ladybug Mecca. Prince Paul is a hip-hop producer and musician who has worked with everyone from De La Soul to Chris Rock. Don Newkirk is a rapper from Hip-Hop group KMD which was signed to Elektra Records in the early 90s. Ladybug Mecca may be the best-known member of the trio as she was a part of Digable Planets, an alternative hip-hop group from the 90s.

'Turn My Teeth Up!' is a project that took five years to put together. This explains why each song feels carefully crafted and honed to perfection. There is real substance behind each track, and you can hear the band members' love and dedication to their music in every note.

""Welcome to the Party,"" the first track of the album, sets the mood and showcases the band's musical range. It's a high-powered party anthem with funky beats, soaring synths, and playful vocals from Ladybug Mecca. ""Plainfield"" incorporates eastern-sounding instruments and rhythms to create a lush sonic landscape that transports you to another world. ""This Song"" is a standout track, thanks to its relatable lyrics, catchy chorus, and vocal harmonies to die for. 

At this point, I must confess that I have a bit of a soft spot for Baby Elephant. As someone who has been following hip-hop and R&B music for years, it's refreshing to see a group that's not afraid to think outside of the box. Each track contains just enough familiarity to keep you tapping your toes, but not so much that you feel like you've heard it all before. 

Overall, 'Turn My Teeth Up!' is an album that's going to surprise and delight you. It's a must-listen for anyone who craves music that's innovative, fresh, and has a lot of heart. While there are a couple of tracks that didn't quite resonate with me, the majority of the album is pure gold. Baby Elephant has successfully created an album that will stick with you long after your first listen.","1.

Ceremony,The L-Shaped Man,Rock,3.3,May 20 2015,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Hardcore is a genre that revels in certain clichés—the ultimate of which is making a record that renounces your ties to hardcore. Despite its commonality, it’s still a risky maneuver: perhaps playing in such a stylistic straitjacket has made a band incapable of doing anything else. Even if it’s an artistically successful record, it can alienate old fans without attracting new ones. Most relevant to Ceremony, it’s a card you only get to play once. Six years after they could be accurately described as ""powerviolence,"" the Bay Area group released their John Goodmanson-produced Matador debut *Zoo—*a slog through boggy, primordial punk, interesting for the sole fact that it was made by a former powerviolence band. Ceremony undergoes another drastic change on The L-Shaped Man, but it cannot be leniently judged relative to Violence Violence. They’re now just one of the thousands of indie rock bands that really want to sound like Joy Division, and sounding no more engaged with their source material than the average dude plucking an Unknown Pleasures graphic T off the rack at Hot Topic. Mind you, Ceremony are on their fifth record and are named after a Joy Division song. But at the very least, the veritable return to their roots makes sense within the context of The L-Shaped Man. Ceremony are also one of the thousands of indie rock bands making a conceptual breakup record; and in these situations, such a breakup is assumed to be so catastrophic that it totally dismantles one’s self-construct and leaves nothing but foundation. Joy Division lyrics, advice from your father, bumper stickers that read ""all things pass""—everything you’ve been led to think is trite once you’re out of your teens might actually reveal themselves to be the truth. There’s no way to judge the authenticity of Ross Farrar’s emotions on The L-Shaped Man. But how can he can be exempt on an album where everything feels like facade? In particular, the facade inherent in Ceremony’s own name, as they grab at the most obvious signifiers of their idols and pass them off as their own. For one thing, Farrar’s vocals are now unrecognizable, or only recognizable as Ian Curtis karaoke. To be fair, Curtis is a natural touchstone for a punk rock carny barker, as his enduring qualities—the militaristic cadences, the claustrophobic melodies—can be approximated without much technical ability. But you can’t fake his command or intensity or sonorousness, though Farrar tries. Or maybe he doesn’t try hard enough. The lyrics are delivered with honesty and presumed urgency. They are also proof that those qualities can be less important than thinking before you talk. The dishwater-gray ambience of ""Exit Fears"" implies sleepless nights filled with lingering regret, while Farrar moans, ""The pain will leave in the night/ Memories return in the light""—which seems to express the exact opposite of what he means. ""The root of the world is in the red heart,"" ""you saw yourself walking with no one else and it scared you""—they all aspire to be aphorisms and fade upon impact like a tweet never to be favorited. The album title itself is indicative of Farrar making observations without any insight—men are generally L-shaped, but...so? The lack of resonance is even more obvious in Farrar’s newfound tone, a monster mash of alternating cartoonish bellow and honk which doesn’t sound like Curtis or Paul Banks so much as the dude from Editors drunkenly imitating Paul Banks trying to sing like Ian Curtis. Of all Farrar’s means of cheating towards cogency—repetition of lyrics that just can’t bear the attempts at establishing portent, lending numerous song titles a definitive article to import significance—the most absurd is his Jay McInerney-like tendency to speak almost entirely in the second person. Call it Turn on the Bright Lights, Big City. As a working unit, Ceremony still play with customary, clumsy enthusiasm. The terse drumrolls, plangent guitar fills, and basslines that are all thumbs—it’s all here and played with the expected looseness of a former hardcore band that moved onto garage rock and is now learning post-punk on the fly. It occasionally coalesces into a surf-goth hybrid that at least justifies John Reis being roped into this. Who knows what Ceremony expected of the former Hot Snakes/Rocket From the Crypt frontman, but his production might be more overmatched than mismatched: the confused melodies Farrar strews over the piano plunking of ""Hibernation"" and the wayward guitar leads in ""Root of the World"" can generously be heard as an experiment in avant-garde atonality. Ceremony would’ve been better off phoning a different guy from Drive Like Jehu—put Mark Trombino behind the drums or the boards and he could provide a high-velocity, low-viscosity sleekness that would make relatively hooky outliers like ""The Separation"" and ""Bleeder"" go incognito on satellite radio as enjoyably derivative post-pop-punk. The L-Shaped Man does have an advantage over Zoo, in that it’s interesting in the way any true debacle is, where a band’s conviction is either impervious to any kind of outside intervention or just not subject to it. Just look at the album cover: almost immediately after Ceremony revealed The L-Shaped Man, fans noticed its too-hilarious-to-be-intentional similarity to a gag from the ""A Millhouse Divided"" episode of ""The Simpsons."" This is better known as the ""Can I Borrow a Feeling"" episode, an unfortunate coincidence seeing as how we’re talking about a record whose entire aesthetic is on loan. It’s even more serendipitous in light of the exact scene with the offending Pictionary attempt—there we have Kirk Van Houten, on the verge of a calamitous divorce, yelling at a dinner party crowd who reacts to his inept visual rendering of ""dignity"" with embarrassed silence. Maybe it's good for a laugh, but only as a defense mechanism against the cringe-inducing experience of watching artistic expression abandon a heartbroken man at his lowest moment.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20569-the-l-shaped-man/,Matador,2015.0,"The L-Shaped Man by Ceremony: A Journey Through Pain and Heartache

Ceremony has been around for over a decade, but The L-Shaped Man marks a significant departure from their previous work. The band has been constantly evolving, exploring new sounds and themes, and this latest offering is no exception.

The album was written after the lead singer’s devastating breakup, and it serves as a powerful exploration of pain, heartache, and loss. Every song on the album is infused with raw emotion, and it is clear that the band poured their hearts into the music.

The L-Shaped Man is a departure from the band's usual punk sound. It is more melodic and atmospheric, with a post-punk influence that gives the whole album a haunting feel. The opener, “Hibernation,” sets the tone for the album with its slow, dreamy melody, and somber lyrics. The album doesn't let go of this feeling of melancholy, and it's the consistent tone that gives the album cohesion.

The album was recorded live in the studio, which gives the music an added intensity. It's clear that the band wanted to capture a specific mood and vibe, and the live recording was the perfect way to do that. The result is a raw, unpolished sound that perfectly matches the themes of the album.

The lyrics on The L-Shaped Man are some of the most personal and vulnerable that Ceremony has ever written. The band's lead singer lays his soul bare, singing about his heartbreak, his regrets, his fears, and his hopes. It's hard not to feel a connection to the singer's pain and to be moved by his vulnerability. Every song on this album feels like a window into the singer's soul.

The standout tracks on The L-Shaped Man are “Your Life in France,” “The Separation,” and “The Understanding.” These songs are the most melodic and feature some of the album's catchiest hooks. Each song tells a different story of heartache and loss, but they are all connected by the overarching theme of the album.

The L-Shaped Man is not an easy listen. It's a journey through pain and heartache that requires an emotional investment, but it is a journey that is ultimately rewarding. The album captures the essence of heartbreak, and it serves as a reminder that even in our darkest moments, there is always hope.

In conclusion, while The L-Shaped Man may not be for everyone, it is an important album for those who are willing to take the journey. Ceremony has demonstrated their ability to evolve and create music that is both personal and affecting. This album is a testament to how powerful music can be in healing and navigating through personal struggles. I give this album a solid 7.5 out of 10.","1.

Pit Er Pat,The Flexible Entertainer,"Experimental,Rock",6.1,January 25 2010,Jason Crock,,"Though The Flexible Entertainer marks some big changes for the group, Pit Er Pat are used to reinvention by now. They began as a backing crew for a singer-songwriter who since left the band, and now have pared down from three members to two since the release of their previous album, High Time. Before their last European tour as a duo, they started writing songs for just sampler, guitar, and voice-- in part to keep the energy level up throughout the set, and partly to travel light. This practically grounded aesthetic choice led to the songs on their dance- and R&B-borrowing new album, which is likely the band's boldest step forward of their career. Having previously fed on a diet of everything post-punk, the band's now opening up to rhythms and sounds from modern R&B. ""Water"", with no guitar or live drums to speak of, opens the record on the most conspicuous shift, as singer Fay Davis-Jeffers tries out more direct, suggestive couplets, one a beat that nods to Timbaland's late-1990s heyday. That said, there's no mistaking it's them: The vocals of Davis-Jeffers are still somewhere between coy and detached, and on the following track, ""Nightroom"", the clean, minimal guitar that dominated the band's previous albums makes itself heard. These are compelling parts, but rarely do the songs add up to more than their sum. There's a promising middle ground on tracks like ""Godspot"", where reverberating keys add hair-raising tension while guitar and keyboards duel around the main melody line. Some of Pit Er Pat's most pronounced rhythms are found on the faux-drum-circle workout ""Summer Rose"" and the extended runtime of ""Emperor of Charms""-- the closest they come here to breaking a sweat. But it's on the final track, ""Specimen"", where they take these elements somewhere more unexpected. Everything gets slowed to a menacing crawl, deep bass hits, the guitar buried under reverb, judicious echo on the drums, and a melodica sounding out a distress call. Minimalism should be the common thread between the band's older music and the particular strain of pop they're channeling here, and yet they seem at odds in many of these tracks. Icy and stiff has been the band's M.O., but its new material demands performances that command that sparseness rather than toy with it. Had the band drawn on some of that confidence from R&B as well as the instrumentation, it could have made this record even more compelling.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13825-the-flexible-entertainer/,Thrill Jockey,2010.0,"If you're a fan of experimental rock, then the latest offering from Pit Er Pat might just be up your alley. 'The Flexible Entertainer' is an album that defies easy categorization, and it's clear that the band has pushed the boundaries of their genre in order to create something truly unique.

Pit Er Pat has been around for over a decade now, and their sound has evolved considerably since their early days. You can hear traces of their earlier work on this album, but there's also a sense that they've moved on and are ready to explore new territory. The result is an album that feels fresh and exciting, even if it's not always easy to pin down.

One thing that's immediately apparent when listening to 'The Flexible Entertainer' is the incredible musicianship on display. The band members are all accomplished multi-instrumentalists, and they're not afraid to experiment with different sounds and textures. There are moments where the album feels almost like a sonic collage, with different layers of sound coming together in unexpected ways. It's a testament to the band's skills that they're able to keep all these elements in balance and create something that never feels cluttered or overwhelming.

The album's creation story is interesting in its own right. According to the band, they spent several years working on the album, using a combination of traditional studio techniques and more avant-garde methods. They recorded parts of the album in a remote cabin in the woods, and also experimented with using found sounds and field recordings. The result is an album that feels organic and dynamic, with each track having its own unique character.

For me, the standout tracks on the album are ""Brain Monster"" and ""Evacuation Day"". The former is a driving, propulsive track that showcases the band's knack for creating catchy hooks within an experimental framework. The latter is a more atmospheric piece, with a haunting melody that lingers in the mind long after the song has finished.

Overall, I'd give 'The Flexible Entertainer' a solid 7 out of 10. It's not always an easy listen, and there are moments where the band's experimentation borders on the indulgent. But there's no denying the creativity and ambition on display here, and it's clear that Pit Er Pat are a band that's still pushing themselves to explore new sonic territory. If you're a fan of experimental rock, then this album is definitely worth a listen.","1.

Oscar,Cut and Paste,Pop/R&B,6.5,May 19 2016,Laura Snapes,Contributor,"Britain's indie scene has rarely felt more more low-stakes than it does right now. The UK albums chart is full of iconoclastic British acts—Radiohead at #1, Skepta, James Blake, Anohni—with very few of them plying their trade on guitar. Even trad-lad bands like the 1975, Catfish and the Bottlemen, and Blossoms have seen the smart money and embraced their boyband potential rather than doggedly committing to life in the indie trenches. Twenty years since Britpop's rot set in, and 10 years on from Arctic Monkeys' debut album, the path to indie success is codified, but a source of ever-diminishing returns; there's the sense of a generation with just enough education to perform, but not really to innovate the genre out of irrelevance. Oscar Scheller's debut album, Cut and Paste, isn't going to do that either, though a decade ago it might have propelled him to the heights of, say, Jack Peñate, another British cheeky chappy with strong pop instincts. The young Londoner makes blown-out indie jams with magnetic melodies and an obvious British lineage: “Sometimes” echoes the melody of Blur's “Coffee and TV,” and his leaping baritone bears a strong resemblance to both Damon Albarn and Morrissey. (For the latter, see also, “But then I see your face and I want to die,” from “Fifteen,” which moves at the pace of a carnation's twirl.) He samples, or rather, for budgetary reasons, emulates samples of old school hip-hop and chintzy dub—“Good Things,” laced with his plaintive croon, sounds a lot like Saint Etienne's cover of “Only Love Can Break Your Heart.” The combination aligns him with a non-British Anglophile: Scheller's romantic, hotch-potch confections recall Jens Lekman's early records, and share a similarly endearing innocence. His lyrics are also naïve, but lack Lekman's charm and wit. They're mostly underdeveloped portraits of youthful anxieties: over masculinity (not knowing which football team to support), the passing of time, and whether the promised future will come to pass. “Nothing's as it seems/There's a land where hopes don't meet with dreams,” he croons on the twinkling, dreamy “Gone Forever,” the record's sharpest song. “I feel scared of all the things to come.” As for his own future, Scheller has written for Lily Allen and short-lived Sugababes revival MKS. Cut and Paste is hooky and appealing; with a gear change, he could easily move into a realm where people are actually paying attention. For now, he's a very sweet stream in a cultural backwater.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21865-cut-and-paste/,Wichita,2016.0,"If there's one thing that's for certain about Oscar, it's that he's a risk-taker. His latest album, Cut and Paste, is no exception. Combining pop and R&B elements, it's an eclectic mix of sounds that showcases his ability to think outside the box.

For those who don't know, Oscar has been making music for several years now. He first gained attention as a producer before stepping out from behind the scenes and dropping his debut album in 2016. Since then, he's been steadily gaining a following thanks to his unorthodox approach to music.

Cut and Paste was born out of a collaboration with a number of different producers and writers, and you can tell - each track has its own unique flavor. There are moments where you'll hear elements of jazz, followed by instances of full-out electronic experimentation.

Personally, I found that some tracks worked better than others. ""No Place Like Home"" is an early standout, with its smooth grooves and catchy chorus. But then there are tracks like ""All I Want Is You,"" which felt a little too overproduced for my liking.

That being said, there's no denying that Oscar is a talented musician. It takes guts to experiment with so many different sounds on one album, and he does it with aplomb. Even when a track didn't quite resonate with me, I still found myself appreciating the risks he was taking.

At the end of the day, Cut and Paste is a solid effort. While it may not be my favorite album of the year, it's definitely one that I'll return to on occasion when I'm in the mood for something unique. I give it a rating of 6.5 out of 10 - not perfect, but definitely worth a listen if you're a fan of pop/R&B.","1.

Xiu Xiu,Plays the Music of Twin Peaks,"Experimental,Rock",7.7,April 14 2016,Benjamin Scheim,Contributor," Xiu Xiu are an archetypally ""difficult"" band. Hard to measure and, at times, hard to digest, they are experimental in the most literal meaning—not musicians exploring ""experimental genres"" of music, but ones who actually experiment, leading to music whose ideas travel the map so broadly as to be deemed unclassifiable when put together. This approach has led the band to develop passionate followers but also put themselves in a position where these constant new approaches not only alienate the mainstream but past fans as well. Given this perspective, the band’s latest release, Plays the Music of Twin Peaks, makes a lot of sense. It’s easy to see parallels between Xiu Xiu and David Lynch—both are challenging, uncompromising artists unafraid of real experimentation or the uneven results that come from it. Though the passing of time (and specifically the post-Mulholland Drive afterglow) has seen public view of the man’s work elevated to near-canonical status, for much of his career Lynch was seen less as a genius and more as a fascinating but flawed artist obsessed with the '50s and the death of the American Dream. Perhaps nowhere is this mix of ""Wow!"" and ""Ungh :-/"" on display more in Lynch’s work than in 1990’s groundbreaking show ""Twin Peaks."" ""Twin Peaks"" was a watershed moment—the first time anyone had attempted to port sinister art-house cinema vision to Big Three television, that mainest of mainstreams—but despite What It Did and What It Meant, ""Twin Peaks"" was still a messy failure that devolved into a soap opera slop—James’s search for meaning, Dick Tremayne, BILLY ZANE!!!—difficult for even diehard fans to stick by. But if you ""got it"" anyway, it just didn’t matter. You just put on headphones, kept watching and felt ok knowing it made you feel ok. One of the reasons why Lynch’s work always hit hard was his way with music and sound, particularly his partnership with Angelo Badalamenti. The score to ""Twin Peaks"" is arguably Badalamenti's crown jewel, and Xiu Xiu do it justice. Their success here is twofold: Not only do they capture the haunted spirit of the show, they also provide Xiu Xiu fans with one of their strongest releases in awhile. The simple, live-in-the-studio recorded feel helps keep the band grounded and the sound uniform, giving it the sense of a live performance. They skip the obvious choice of ""Falling"" as opener--the vocal version of the famous theme, the first music you hear on the show and ""Twin Peaks""’s most recognizable number--and opts for the instrumental ""Laura Palmer’s Theme,"" which begins not with the famous Moby-sampled synth but instead a very portentous tom drum thud followed by sustain-pedaled piano notes.  The choice here indicates upfront that they intend to evoke something deeper and more resonant than simple nostalgia. ""Laura Palmer’s Theme"" is followed by ""Into the Night,"" the album’s best track, and one of three with vocals. The original, featuring Julee Cruise, is hard to top, but this version is bold and ominous, propulsive and mysterious. In a way, Stewart's manic delivery suits this material better than it sometimes does on his own. On the last vocal number, ""Sycamore Tree,"" they take a tune originally sung by jazz legend Little Jimmy Scott and bring it closer to ""a Xiu Xiu song"" (if such a thing exists, I guess), than anything else on Plays. Stewart channels the dead Scott with a caricatured capital-P Performance  that succeeds without feeling fake or contrived. On “Falling,” Stewart relies on the soaring, heart-tweaking power of the song without overselling it. While Stewart’s singing in Xiu Xiu often feels like it's been appended on top of or along side of the music it accompanies, on these three it feels threaded into its fabric. I even found myself yearning for a Xiu Xiu version of ""Just You,"" the corny and inexplicable '50s ballad sung by Laura Palmer’s boyfriend James. The instrumentals are nearly as strong, including ""Packard’s Vibration,"" which begins as a vibraphone-led jazz number before the distorted guitar and shimmering synths help it achieve lift-off. The only real misstep is the closer, ""Josie’s Past,"" which adds spoken word readings of entries from ""Laura Palmer’s Diary"" by band member Angela Seo.  The vocals, spoken in stilted, accented English, only call attention to the terrible cheesiness of the writing—and, god, at nearly eight minutes, it nearly dares you to stop listening before the end. Stewart gives a perfectly ridiculous thirty second reading of the '40s song ""Mairzy Doats"" (sung by Laura’s dad Leland Palmer on the show) five minutes in and the whole track would have worked better as a 60 second bit with just that. These are minor gripes, though. Appreciators of the uncanny, the beautiful, the upsetting, the uncomfortable–all groups that contain hardcore Lynch and Xiu Xiu fans—will find something here. In evoking Lynch and Badalamenti, Xiu Xiu have made one of their most beautiful and listenable albums, one that highlights everything the band does well while shaving down the rough edges that often turn away foes and friends alike.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21749-plays-the-music-of-twin-peaks/,Polyvinyl / Bella Union,2016.0,"Alright folks, I'm excited to dive into Xiu Xiu's the ""Plays the Music of Twin Peaks"" album with you today. This experimental rock band has been around since the early 2000s and has always pushed the boundaries of what's expected of them. In fact, the band's very name, Xiu Xiu, was inspired by a Chinese film that dealt with taboo topics such as homosexuality, which set the tone for the band's willingness to push boundaries musically and lyrically.

Now, when it comes to their latest release, ""Plays the Music of Twin Peaks,"" we find Xiu Xiu doing what they do best: experimenting with sound, lyrics, and atmosphere. David Lynch's cult TV series Twin Peaks was known for its dream-like sequences, eerie characters, and captivating soundtrack. Xiu Xiu remained true to this aesthetic and delivered a 12-track album that perfectly captured the Twin Peaks spirit.

What's fascinating about this album is how Xiu Xiu interpreted the original music from the show. Rather than merely recreating the tracks with their own instruments, they deconstructed them and rebuilt them in their unique style. The result is a haunting, atmospheric album that's a perfect mix of Lynch's original vision and Xiu Xiu's experimental tendencies.

When I put on this album, I felt like I was transported to another world. The instrumentation, the vocals, and the production all worked together to create this dreamy soundscape that's equal parts achingly beautiful and chillingly disturbing. Songs such as ""Laura Palmer's Theme"" and ""The World Spins"" are stunningly beautiful, while tracks like ""Sycamore Tree"" and ""Dance of the Dream Man"" are unsettling and filled with dissonance.

While there are moments where the experimentation might be a bit much for some listeners, it's important to remember that's precisely what Xiu Xiu does- push boundaries. The band has always created music from the gut, and this album is no exception. They've taken the music from one of the most iconic and beloved television series and made it their own.

Overall, ""Plays the Music of Twin Peaks"" is a masterful piece of music that's a must-listen for anyone who loved the show or enjoys experimental rock. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, anyone who appreciates innovative music will find something to enjoy on this album. I recommend you immerse yourself in the album in a quiet, dark room and let the music transport you to the eerie world of Twin Peaks. With a rating of 7.7 out of 10, it's a solid addition to any music collection.","1.

Girl Band,The Early Years EP,Rock,7.2,April 20 2015,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"The obvious joke with Girl Band is that the Irish quartet features no girls (and not everyone’s laughing), but really, the bigger misdirection lies in calling themselves a band. Sure, their composition conforms to standard punk-rock parameters—yelping singer, fuzzbox-tweaking guitarist and bassist, pugilistic drummer—but even at its most ferocious, their music lacks the emotionally raw, primal catharsis we associate with post-hardcore acts. They come off more like steely lab technicians administering shock treatment for dubious purposes. You don’t so much listen to a Girl Band song as get strapped into it: militaristic drum stomps mimic the beat of your pounding heart; foreboding, unidentifiable noises emerge suddenly from unseen corners seemingly by the push of a button; and, as they pile on the punishment with sadistic glee, your convulsions effectively form a new dance move. It’s a drill that Girl Band have been gradually perfecting over the past two years, through a string of singles that have showcased their bone-crushing force, but through markedly different demonstrations, be it 25-second circle-pit blurts or updates of songs by everyone from Beat Happening to Blawan. While these tracks have been compiled by Rough Trade on The Early Years to introduce Girl Band to North American audiences, the EP is also a snapshot of a band still figuring out how to harness the nihilistic noise of punk and the architectural precision of dance music without conforming to the conventions of either. It’s no insult to say that Girl Band’s signature song at this point is a cover—because it's one that perfectly encapsulates both their antagonistic essence and unorthodox methodology. Their grueling distension of Blawan’s ""Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage""from 2013 not only betrayed a vision that looked far beyond punk for inspiration, but proved to be an ideal vehicle for frontman Dara Kiely to assert his split personality: part arch absurdist, part panic-attacked nervous wreck. The band’s hammering 2014 single ""Lawman"" further entrenched these sarcastic/spastic extremes, though, after the past year of awful police-related headlines, the satirical non sequitirs (""He starts every sentence with 'I know I’m not a racist, but…'"") and the song’s violent meltdown climax have acquired an accidental, uncomfortably topical resonance. Girl Band’s singular qualities are best appreciated in these longer tracks, which clear adequate space for Kiely's wild mood swings, while affording the band enough time to experiment and find just the right dissonant frequencies to power their apocalyptic finales. The more concentrated songs, naturally, give them less to do: the rumble through Beat Happening’s ""I Love You"" is ultimately more a reverential nod to Girl Band’s smart-ass indie ancestors than something they try to fully claim as their own, while the group were in such a rush to unleash half-minute no-fi thrasher ""The Cha Cha Cha"" that they seemingly neglected to master it properly. But ""De Bom Bom"" marks the point where Girl Band’s primordial aggression and burgeoning ambitions start to coalesce, packing all the textural disorientation and mounting intensity of their extended workouts into a taut, three-and-a-half-minute shot. Like the Girl Band name itself, the title of The Early Years is a silly joke—for one, the EP doesn’t even include the band’s earliest recordings (that would be 2012’s France 98 mini-album), and the period that it faux-nostalgically canonizes covers a mere 19-month span that ended just last summer. But the mercurial, combustible potential within suggests we may not be laughing at it for much longer—like patron saints Liars’ equally feral 2001 debut, The Early Years could one day seem like a mere baby step for a band that has evolved into something even more imposing.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20394-the-early-years-ep/,Rough Trade,2015.0,"Hello, folks! Today, I want to talk about a band I’ve recently come across - Girl Band. Their new album, The Early Years EP, is the perfect showcase of their talent, and with a rating of 7.2 out of 10, I can confidently say that this is a must-listen for all rock music enthusiasts.

Let me give you a little backstory on the band. Hailing from Dublin, Girl Band formed in 2011, consisting of members Dara Kiely, Alan Duggan, Daniel Fox, and Adam Faulkner. Their music is known to be experimental, and I must say, they have truly found their sound with The Early Years EP. 

The album is a compilation of their early work, showcasing their development and growth as a band, and this journey is evident in every song on this album. From the aggressive and explosive ""In Plastic"" to the haunting and hypnotic ""Lawman,"" Girl Band's music has the ability to leave you in a strange yet euphoric daze.

But what I appreciate most about this album is the raw emotion that comes through in every song. It's evident that the band poured their heart and soul into the making of this album, and it shows in the haunting melodies and unsettling lyrics of each track.

As someone who has a taste for experimental and unconventional rock music, I found The Early Years EP to be an absolute treat. The primal rumble of the guitar riffs, piercing percussion, and raw vocals - everything about this album is pure rock n' roll at its finest.

In conclusion, Girl Band has truly raised the bar with The Early Years EP, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something fresh and innovative in the rock music scene. It's a gloriously unsettling album that demands your attention, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this talented band.","1.

Pavement,"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA's Desert Origins",Rock,10.0,October 25 2004,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"In a 1994 interview with Option magazine, Steve Malkmus recalled his pre-Pavement band Straw Dog opening for Black Flag in Stockton, California. ""I was backstage before the show and all those guys, they looked so scary, I was afraid of them,"" Malkmus told writer Jason Fine. ""Like, Greg Ginn was mixing up this stuff in a glass. It was probably just protein powder or some healthy drink, but I thought it was heroin or something."" Observing Henry Rollins squeezing a cue ball to pump himself up, Malkmus compared the Sisyphean ritual to smashing your head against a brick wall. ""That's what I thought punk was, you know. That's when I knew that maybe I'm just not punk enough."" No maybes about it. The late-1993 press photos that accompany the lavish 62-page booklet included with this heavily augmented 2xCD reissue of Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain tell the story. After original drummer Gary Young split earlier in the year and Steve West, Bob Nastanovich and Mark Ibold joined Malkmus and Scott Kannberg, Pavement looked like a scrubbed-up gang of packaging majors in search of a good tailgate party (jolly Nastanovich in U-Mass windbreaker, clean-cut S.M. in puffy red ski jacket; only West's Harry Carey-style specs suggest that these guys might be hanging with New York hipsters). The dorkily collegiate look was of no concern to Pavement, because to them, appearances never mattered. That's what all the indie bands said back then, of course, even the ones who threw away the twin-blade, let their jeans wear through the knees, flew the flannel, and became world famous. But from the first Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain single (""Cut Your Hair"") forward, Pavement, on the verge of the big time, opted out. Who knew why, really? Kannberg would do some soapboxing when pressed in interviews (he wouldn't deal with Rolling Stone because he didn't like how they covered the 80s), but Pavement was never about principles-- at least not ones you could easily name. An anti-fashion statement is still a fashion statement, but Pavement was on another trip. They liked to make fun of rock iconography, but they were smart enough to avoid offering an alternative. You never really knew where Pavement stood on anything, which kept an air of mystery and made their music malleable. Pavement's sophomore outing does not contain 12 perfect songs but it is close to a perfect album. Each of the best half-dozen-- ""Silence Kit"", ""Elevate Me Later"", ""Cut Your Hair"", ""Unfair"", ""Gold Soundz"", and ""Range Life""-- contain Malkmus' catchy and highly unusual melodies (""Silence Kit"" cribs from Buddy Holly, but even that's an odd gesture) and would be career highlights for most rock bands. But even the songs that aren't necessarily brilliant work well in the context of the album, moving things along in their own way. The Dave Brubeck send-up ""5-4=Unity"", for example, is a perfect placeholder between two unbelievably great songs. And the closing ""Fillmore Jive"" ends an album at least partly about the music industry on an appropriately classic rock note, with an extended group-jam coda on par with ""Hey Jude"". Not many records are this easy to put on in the car and let play start to finish. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain has been called one of the great California albums, but unlike most records slapped with that label, it avoids dreams and nightmares and focuses on the banal. This is a suburban California album, and since suburbs are exactly the same from Sacto to Levittown, it's an album to which all suburban kids can relate. To us, the imagery of ""Elevate Me Later"" (""underneath the fake oil burning lamps in the city we forgot to name"") and ""Range Life"" (the kid on the skateboard is coasting through a winding subdivision, not Brooklyn) is instantly familiar. But really, though Crooked Rain references the burbs and the music biz, with Pavement it's the sound and feel that matter, not the words or themes. Quoting lyrics to get to the heart of Pavement is misguided. Go online and print some out and you'll see that, taken on their own, they're generally meaningless. Read the track-by-track notes S.M. prepared for Melody Maker at the time of the record's release (reprinted in the booklet here) and it's clear just how unknowable these songs are. ""Stop Breathin"" is about tennis and the Civil War, of course; ""Elevate Me Later"" is about political correctness; ""Heaven Is a Truck"" is ""loosely based on the singer from Royal Trux."" Whatever. Judging from the several alternate takes of Crooked Rain songs included on Disc Two, it seems that Malkmus tinkered with words constantly, and that the final versions are those sung on the take that wound up in the can. The ""I/they don't have no function"" bit in ""Range Life"", which most people take to be a self-deprecating line to let Malkmus off the hook for ragging on the Smashing Pumpkins fans, was probably just a glitch that he didn't want to go back and fix. The early version of ""Range Life"" recorded with Gary Young (one of eight such unreleased tracks on the 25-track bonus disc) had no such sentiment, and lyrics-wise, it's a completely different song. ""Ell Ess Two"", an early version of ""Elevate Me Later"" from the Young sessions, is also completely different and yet unintelligible in the same way. It's the way words sound and the way Malkmus sings them that gives his songs meaning. The remainder of the first disc is given over to the B-sides and compilation songs released during the period. I've always thought Pavement's celebrated B-side prowess to be a tad overrated, but certainly the gorgeous and quiet ""Strings of Nashville"" is one of the best songs in the band's catalog (love that synthesized traffic whoosh), and ""Stare"", ""Raft"", and ""Nail Clinic"" all rate alongside other original Crooked Rain tracks. The two R.E.M. knocks, on the other hand-- the half-cover of ""Camera"" and the ""Tweeter & the Monkey Man""-style goof ""Unseen Power of the Picket Fence""-- are in league with ""Haunt You Down"" as weeded-out experiments for only the most hardcore fans. The second disc, containing period unreleased material, is an equally mixed bag that turns up a few true gems. The most anticipated tracks are the first eight, recorded in 1993 with Gary Young and never officially released in any form. ""All My Friends"" is by far the best of these, and could fairly be called a Pavement classic (it would have fit quite nicely on the Watery, Domestic EP), and ""Soiled Little Filly"" is almost as good. The three alternate versions of Crooked Rain songs from these sessions (""Ell Ess Two"", ""Range Life"", and ""Stop Breathin""), and one later re-recorded for Wowee Zowee (""Flux=Rad"") are interesting but ultimately show how Pavement had outgrown Young's primitive studio set-up (speaking of Wowee Zowee, early versions of ""Grounded"", ""Kennel District"", and two takes on ""Pueblo"" were recorded at the New York Crooked Rain sessions as well. Since these are three of Wowee's best songs, this was a fertile period indeed.) Jokey experiments, a few strong songs, a couple instrumentals-- including a welcome no-vox version of ""Strings of Nashville""-- and four Peel Sessions tracks round out the generous bonus disc. The perfect dusty trunk hauled down from the attic. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain was my introduction to Pavement and I loved it instantly. I was traveling a lot in '92 and '93 and was rarely close to a stereo, so somehow Slanted & Enchanted never made it on my radar. When I finally bought S&E;, my first thought was, all right, sweet, some of these songs are as good as the ones on Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. There's no question that S&E; is a fantastic record, but to me, parts of it sound like Pavement wearing a costume. Listen to the brilliant ""Summer Babe"" and know that Malkmus loves Lou Reed, but East Coast cool ultimately isn't his style. On Crooked Rain, Pavement became a band, opened up (as much as they ever could, anyway), and sounded like themselves: smart, funny, confident, West Coast, suburban. The confidence was key. Malkmus and Kannberg grew up loving bands loved by critics, and in their short history, the critics couldn't stop talking about them. In 1994, they were ready to take on the world, but chose to do so in their own quiet and unforgettable way.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6200-crooked-rain-crooked-rain-las-desert-origins/,"Matador,Matador",1994.0,"Hey there music lovers, today we're diving into the timeless rock classic, Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA's Desert Origins by Pavement. This is not just any album, it's truly a masterpiece of the genre. With a perfect rating of 10.0 out of 10, this record is a must-listen for any fan of rock music.

Before we dive into the music, let's talk a bit about the band. Pavement was formed in 1989 by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg, who met at the University of California, Davis. It wasn't until 1992 when they released their critically acclaimed debut album, Slanted and Enchanted. However, it was with their second album, Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain that they really cemented their place in the world of rock music.

The album, released in 1994, showcased their versatility as a band, blending garage rock, country, and even a touch of folk. The songs are raw, honest, and transcendental, capturing the spirit of the times and the band's own experiences. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain was recorded in Los Angeles, and it is said that the barren desert landscape played a major influence on the album's sound.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Range Life."" The song encapsulates the band's signature sound, with jangly guitars, Malkmus' nonchalant vocals, and a driving, catchy melody. The track's lyrics are humorous and sarcastic, taking a subtle dig at the mainstream music industry, and poking fun at life in L.A.

Another highlight of the album is ""Gold Soundz."" The song opens with a delicate guitar riff, which gradually builds to a powerful, anthemic chorus. The lyrics are melancholic and reflective, touching on themes of love, loss, and self-discovery. It's a testament to the band's songwriting skills that they can create such an emotionally resonant track while still staying true to their punk roots.

I personally am entranced by this album due to its phenomenal storytelling nature. The instrumentation, vocals, and lyrics all come together to create a complete and immersive listening experience. There are layers upon layers of detail to unpick in every song, and the more I listen to the album, the more I appreciate it.

To wrap things up, Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA's Desert Origins is a true masterpiece of rock music that stands the test of time. It's an album for the ages, and any rock music fan owes it to themselves to give it a proper listen. Pavement's unique sound and undeniable talent make this record a true gem, and a deserving recipient of a perfect rating of 10.0 out of 10.","1.

Rising,To Solemn Ash,,7.6,January 27 2012,Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,"The young Danish sludge trio Rising have a familiar sound, but their ability to pen vast, melodic anthems is sharp enough that originality isn't really an issue. Especially if you're into rockers in the tradition of Baroness or Remission-era Mastodon. Unlike the more recent versions of those older groups, Rising aren't into ""experimentation."" To Solemn Ash, their 10-song debut, offers straightforward metal that may come laced with the occasional acoustic interlude, but could definitely be reproduced in the smallest, shittiest club in the world without the help of guest musicians, triggers, a psychedelic choir, or a laptop. (The collection, released across Europe in October, saw its American release earlier this month.) They've found multiple ways to come off expansive and compelling within a tight, traditional framework. In fact, To Solemn Ash goes places a 2009 EP and even a 2010 single couldn't without sounding too much different from either of the earlier efforts. Rising are ramping things up here, and honing a specific style, all without stepping outside of well-worn genre lines. The sequencing helps. Immediately likable opening track ""Mausoleum"" and ""Sea of Basalt"", the song that follows it, find bellowing vocalist/bassist Henrik Hald, guitarist/backup vocalist Jacob Krogholt, and drummer Jacob Johansen (the one new addition after their last recording) firing on all cylinders: ""Mausoleum""'s dynamics feel like tectonic shifts, and remain immensely hummable; ""Basalt"" finds them nodding at Kylesa with gruff multi-tracked vocal shouts and instrumentation that continually ebbs, crests, and regains momentum until the final bit of feedback. (Which raises a question: How do three dudes from Denmark sound so much like four or five folks from Georgia?) Rising don't maintain this focus for 48 minutes, but there are plenty of ""wow"" moments like the six-minute Torche-meets-Neurosis of the mid-tempo ""ballads"" ""Cohorts Rise"" and ""Under Callous Wings"", the frantic Converge-like riffing on the album's shortest track ""Through the Eyes of Catalysis"", and the way you feel like you can suddenly imagine High on Fire as a (very powerful) pop band while listening to ""Heir to the Flames"". The trio isn't afraid to groove or veer into somewhat poppier territory, and can pull it off without sacrificing heaviness or getting too cute: They simply know how to write great riffs, and newbie producer Jakob Reichert Nielsen should probably be giving tutorials to ""star"" recordists who don't yet know how to make metal sound huge, polished, and just-raw-enough in their more renowned studios. It's worth repeating: For all the quality, head nods, and goosebumps this album provides, Rising are, more or less, a basic sludge-metal band. And it's refreshing not having to also pull out the words ""post"" or ""avant"" to describe them.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16214-to-solemn-ash/,Exile On Mainstream,2012.0,"If you're looking for some simmering, yet visceral metal that explores the breadth of the human experience, then you need to get your hands on 'To Solemn Ash' by Rising.

Rising is a Danish powerhouse that has been creating some seriously intense music since 2008. The band started as a project based on the ideas of guitarist and vocalist Jacob Krogholt, and has since become a full-fledged outfit that has generated a devoted following. 'To Solemn Ash' is their third album, wrestling with themes such as hope, despair, grief, and redemption through an onslaught of riffs and pounding drums.

The album's creation story is one that is rooted in the band's commitment to the creative process. Prior to recording the album, Rising spent an intensive period of time at their rehearsal space, refining, rehearsing, and developing the songs that would ultimately make it onto the album. The band's dedication to the craft of making music shines through on this record.

From the opening notes of 'Mausoleum', you know you are in for a journey. The track instantly grabs you with its menacing riff, announcing Rising's presence with authority. As the album progresses, we're taken on a journey that is both cathartic and musically compelling. The emotional depth of the lyrics is matched only by the sonic depth of the music.

The entire album is a tour de force, and it's hard to pick out standout tracks because they are all so damn good. One highlight is 'Hybrid Cult', which features an intense barrage of drums and a dynamic guitar solo that cuts through the mix like a knife. Another gem is 'Funeral Pyre,' which showcases Krogholt's vocals in a way that is both raw and heartfelt.

Personally, I find this album to be one of the most engaging and artful pieces of music that I have heard in some time. Sure, it's heavy at times, but it's also incredibly moving. There's a sense of cathartic release that permeates the album- an invitation to confront and channel one's emotions in a positive way.

Overall, I would rate 'To Solemn Ash' an impressive 7.6 out of 10. Every element of the album, from the songwriting to the production, is indicative of a band that is committed to creating meaningful music. This album is a must-hear for anyone who appreciates metal that is thoughtful, sophisticated, and downright epic.","1.

Soft Canyon,"Broken Spirit, I Will Mend Your Wings",Rock,6.0,November 6 2003,Alex Linhardt,,"Despite everything my foster parents taught me in the formative stages of my life, I looked at the label before I listened to this album. I understand this is the most grievous sin a reviewer can wallow in. Tricky Woo, Andrew Dickson's old band, was one of the great maestros of Canadian nostalgaragic rock, shredding out dimebags of scalding calamity with the attention and maturity of guitar-wreathed pre-adolescents. So I was understandably frothing out of my pores when his new band, Soft Canyon, got signed to Alien8 Recordings, a triumphantly experimental label that's released everything from Keiji Haino to Francisco Lopez. This was truly going to be a melding of minds, my generation's version of the Yalta Convention, reassembling post-war Europe with the fury only experimental rock can muster! Basically, I fully expected the first track to be called ""Rock 'N Roll Lunar Orbit 89 dash Armageddon "" It is actually called ""For You"". I believe my response, if this transcript I'm holding is accurate, was, ""Oh."" Rather than impart any negative words to my cherished Alien8, I'm going to put the rest of this review in brackets so it will never hurt anyone ever again. Freud called this ""lying."" I call it ""a terrible idea."" [""For You"" starts with a zestful beat, drowsy back-up harmonies, and braiding guitar lines. Unfortunately, the chorus is one note pretending it's ten, with a brainless heavy-handedness that would be more appropriate on a Train (maybe Green Day) album, one of those songs written for imaginary bands in movies influenced by better bands. It's hardly even worth mentioning that the song is about ""magenta planes"" and ""ocean music from strings that never end."" (Apparently this is the indie rock version of rap songs professing their own potency. Please, bands, stop critiquing yourselves and taking away my money!) The one compelling aspect of the song is the looming guitar solos, occasionally venturing into a sonic unruliness somewhere between Tricky Woo and Kim Thayil. Later, ""Hope's Great Divide"" replicates an Abbey Road bridge that wasn't interesting enough for me to figure out which specific song it came from. ""Sunflight"" begins as two girthed chords as produced by Willie Mitchell, but unexpectedly develops into a subdued anthem. Discouragingly, that anthem seems to be ""Sunflight, stay with me tonight."" Dickson's vocals are either irksomely whiny or in a growl better suited to a fifth-wave jam band than these tight pop melodies. Elsewhere, though, these vagrant genres coagulate into a mighty devilish genre-meld. On ""Kaleidoscope Mountain"", evaporating surf-guitar, stiff drums, and exasperatingly childish keyboards bounce over rockabilly ska. I dislike pseudo-surrealistic lyrics and I dislike love lyrics even more, but I have been bombarded with enough Johnny Cash articles recently that I have found room in my cancerous heart for the chorus, ""I walked into a lake of fire... and washed my hands."" Of course, about halfway through it spontaneously decides it would rather be a Pink Floyd tune (and little more). They might not be engendering new avant-garde circles, but, come on, Pink Floyd was a pretty damn good band-- but not good enough that I could reasonably be expected to sit through seven minutes of ""We Threw Our Love into the Universe"", a song so utterly indebted to Pink Floyd (to the exclusion of all else, including other Floyd plagiarizers) that I have little incentive to finish this sentence. Soft Canyon make no attempts to deceive anyone. From the cover to the song titles, the aim of the album quite clearly seems to be to serve only as an assortment of rip-offs and homages (indistinguishable ones, at that) to Beach Boys-inflected sunshine-pop and doomed surrealistic spaz-metal. Admittedly, I'm very amenable to such combinations, but there's simply not enough here to differentiate Soft Canyon from the innumerable minions of Elephant 6-derived progeny.]",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7721-broken-spirit-i-will-mend-your-wings/,Alien8,2003.0,"When I first heard that Soft Canyon was coming out with a new album, I wasn't sure what to expect. Their previous work had always been solid, but I wondered if they could push their sound further. After listening to ""Broken Spirit, I Will Mend Your Wings,"" I can say that they've exceeded my expectations.

To understand the significance of this album, it's important to know a little bit about Soft Canyon's history. The band was formed in the mid-2000s by lead singer and guitarist, Alex Redmoon. Their sound has always been heavily influenced by classic rock, but they've managed to put their own spin on it throughout the years. And with this latest release, they've continued to evolve their sound in interesting ways.

According to Redmoon, ""Broken Spirit, I Will Mend Your Wings"" was inspired by personal struggles he went through in his personal life. The songs on this album explore themes of heartbreak, loss, and resilience. And you can feel that emotional intensity throughout each track.

One of the standout tracks on the album, in my opinion, is ""Cracked Open."" The guitar riffs are reminiscent of early Led Zeppelin, but with a modern twist. And Redmoon's vocals are haunting and raw. It's a song that hits you right in the gut, and it's hard not to feel a personal connection to the lyrics.

I also enjoyed ""Chasing the Sun,"" which has a more upbeat and energetic feel to it. It's a song about seizing the day and living life to the fullest. The chorus is catchy and I've found myself humming it long after the song has ended.

Overall, I'd give this album a solid 8 out of 10. While it doesn't reinvent the wheel, Soft Canyon has managed to create a compelling and emotional album that will resonate with fans of classic rock. If you're looking for a new band to check out, I highly recommend giving ""Broken Spirit, I Will Mend Your Wings"" a listen.","1.

Feadz,Instant Alpha,,4.3,February 7 2014,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Feadz, aka Fabian Pianta, has been a longtime pillar of French house. He emerged in the late 90s alongside Mr. Oizo (whose excellent, deranged 1999 album Analog Worms Attack was a Feadz co-production), accompanied Uffie during her stint in the spotlight from ""Pop the Glock"" onwards, and put in work for both BPitch Control and Ed Banger, two of the most vital, tastemaking labels of the 00s. Throughout that time, he's managed to build a following as both an influential DJ and a jack-of-all-trades producer who can dabble in just about any corner of dance music there is. If his full-length debut, Instant Alpha, highlights anything, it's the limits of how far mere dabbling can get a producer—especially if that artist tries to fuse all his limited tricks together. Instant Alpha betrays a sound that staples together the most immediate, surface-level pleasures of an accumulated jumble of styles and expects the in-your-face bits to prop up otherwise hollow-sounding tracks. Electro's Euro-slick decadence, trap's chest-out wildness, Southern rap's low-end throb, grime's raw low-budget futurism, house's lifeblood pulse, bass music's rhythmic elasticity—these ideas are all melted down and left to congeal on the counter, leaving a burnt yet cold pile of goo that sort of resembles a cursory club jam. The main culprit is the impatient, almost assaultive way Feadz rolls out his beats. I say ""beats"" when a more accurate term would be tics—machine-gun kicks are shoved out into wide-open spaces where they're subjected to water-drip bloops, hyperactive stammering vocal snippets, strobing synthesizers that hiccup until they puke, and incessant empty-calorie hooks (like this unattributed winner from ""Papercut"": ""I spit fire like I tongue-kissed a dragon""). The line between that kind of thing being big dumb fun and a big dumb headache is almost invisible, but with a whole lot of momentum-shifting jumpiness and not a lot of time to build organically and gradually to a crescendo—most tracks are less than 3 1/2 minutes—it all feels too anxious and bristly to soundtrack anything short of a mindstate aided by moon rocks and vodka, and even then it might sour your mood. Want a florid description of how the music's supposed to make you feel? ""The Purpose"" has you covered there, as the distorted voice of TTC's Teki Latex relays the agenda of a man who sounds like a benevolent megalomaniac of a DJ ambassador: ""Connecting minds together through an invisible network of vibrations, creating euphoric states, projecting childhood memories inside your brain, but taking you to yet unknown places."" You'll also get a good sense of the sound via the list of obvious influences. For instance, ""Electric Empire"", featuring guest vocalist Kito, is a thematic hybrid of Daft Punk's roll-call ""Teachers"" and GZA's ""Labels"" wordplay (""It's a house without a home/ Uptown in 'Techno City'/ With Mo'Wax than you can think of in your Metroplex Fantasy""). There might be the occasional inspired rhythm track under all this mess—""Metaman"" and ""Eastside"" at least prove that Feadz knows his way around an 808 (or a simulacrum thereof)—but it's nothing you can't get from countless other artists who choose not to bury those beats in over-the-top hyperactivity like a parodic attempt at the next ""Harlem Shake"". It's all signifiers and nothing signified, exploring the possibilities of cross-genre dance music the same way mashing an action figure and a Barbie doll together explores sex.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19003-feadz-instant-alpha/,Ed Banger,2014.0,"If you are looking for an album that will transport you to a unique soundscape, then Instant Alpha by Feadz might be your cup of tea. This is a brave and experimental piece of work that blends elements of nan and electronic music, resulting in a sound that is not easy to categorize.

To fully appreciate Instant Alpha, it's important to delve into the history of the band. Feadz is a French DJ and producer who has been active in the music industry since the early 2000s. He is best known for his collaborations with artists like Justice and Busy P, as well as his own solo work. Instant Alpha is Feadz's second studio album, released in 2014.

The creation story behind Instant Alpha reveals that Feadz was going through a creative block when he started working on the album. He decided to take a break from his usual approach and experiment with different sounds and techniques. The result is a collection of tracks that are eclectic, playful, and unexpected.

As I listened to Instant Alpha, I found myself drawn into the unique world that Feadz had created. Each track has its own distinct personality, with some being more upbeat and danceable than others. The album kicks off with the track ""Metaman"", which sets the tone for the entire album with its heavy bassline and futuristic sound effects.

One of my personal favourite tracks on the album is ""Paper Proclamation"", which has a dreamy and ethereal quality that is hard to describe. The combination of delicate piano notes and subtle electronic beats creates a sense of trance-like serenity.

However, not all tracks on the album are equally successful. Some of them feel a bit too chaotic or scattered, lacking the coherence that would make them enjoyable to listen to. For example, the track ""Plastic Woman"" features a disorienting mix of clashing beats and jarring vocal samples that might not be everyone's cup of tea.

Overall, Instant Alpha is an intriguing and adventurous album that manages to push the boundaries of electronic music. While it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate experimentation and originality will find plenty to enjoy in Feadz's latest offering. So, if you're looking for a musical experience that is both challenging and rewarding, give Instant Alpha a listen. You won't regret it.","1.

Lilacs & Champagne,Danish & Blue,Rock,6.3,June 7 2013,Nick Neyland,Contributor,"The second album from Lilacs & Champagne takes the provocation of yesteryear and softens it at the corners, offering a form of easy-on-the-ear radicalism. It's not an overtly political work, although it is one that illustrates how just about anything can retreat into the margins and become a form of background noise. Lilacs & Champagne are the sample-happy duo of Alex Hall and Emil Amos, who craft this stuff away from their main focus in the instrumental rock act Grails. This is a continuation of the work started on their eponymous 2012 debut, with porn and B-movie dialogue mixed up with studied guitar soloing and a blitz of lounge oriented samples. The title is presumably a reference to Danish Blue, a documentary from 1968 that advocated for the legalization of pornography in Denmark. But nothing here seeks to agitate, instead taking outsider art and attempting to expose its soft underbelly. The references Hall and Amos flip through in their work are an amalgam of the overt and the obscure. ""Alone Again And..."" offers a reduction of the hippy protest dream that makes a titular reference to Arthur Lee's work in Love, while the following ""Police Story"" works through familiar emblems from TV cop show themes. But the cut-and-paste nature of their work means it doesn't just hark back to the original source material-- it does it by way of similarly minded 90s artists such as Tipsy and Sukia, who both had a fondness for piecing tracks together around lounge/exotica samples. The difference here is that this album is a much more passive listening experience, not really inviting the listener to get involved, apparently content to let everything sink into the sidelines. Even an intentional piece of button-pushing dialogue on the title track is barely pushed to the fore. You almost expect someone to leap out and apologise for it being there. That coy sense of playfulness is a big part of the appeal when Hall and Amos get it right. The expertly disjointed ""Sour/Sweet"" finds beauty in twining peace with chaos, where a scattered drum sample drunkenly lurches into cut-ups of a fresh soul singer. It doesn't belabor the point, getting out in just over two-minutes, offering the perfect distillation of what this band could potentially be. The longer material often gets ponderous, attempting to find a resting ground between psychedelic guitar stokes and something approaching easy listening, but failing to really tap into the power of either. When Stereolab were sourcing artists like Esquivel and Martin Denny, they primarily recognized the striking sounds they were using, culled from strange percussion tools, odd deviations in dynamics, or a great sway of vocal harmonies. Danish & Blue doesnâ€™t get to that spot, instead settling into being that thing you hum while doing other, more important things. Hall has stated that this record is intended to be a ""direct tribute to the musical outsiders of the past,"" which makes a strange fit for the reticence and casual air of the album. In a sense it's a logical next step for the dilution of works that could once have been read as insurrectionary, a further blunting of the knife for anyone who might still be incensed that music by the Clash was used in a jeans ad. Taking that fire and pushing it further into the background, turning it into an approximation of what Erik Satie wonderfully dubbed ""furniture music,"" feels like an endpoint of sorts, if not a particularly interesting one. But Danish & Blue doesn't come close to either making a statement or reaching into the daze that made their debut so pleasingly disorienting. This is the early-hours sound you nod off to, not the one that has you second guessing what you heard.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18130-lilacs-champagne-danish-blue/,Mexican Summer,2013.0,"Upon first glance, Lilacs & Champagne's ""Danish & Blue"" may seem like a typical rock album with a rating of 6.3 out of 10, but upon closer listen, it's a rare gem of a creation. The duo behind the music, Emil Amos and Alex Hall, have crafted a sound that's not easily categorized. Lilacs & Champagne may be known for their experimental and psychedelic beats, but this album in particular takes their talent to new heights.

Emil Amos and Alex Hall both have worked on individual projects before Lilacs & Champagne, with Emil being the drummer for the band Om and Alex being a member of Grails. However, with Lilacs & Champagne, they come together to produce something entirely unique. The collaboration started in 2010 when Emil found himself fascinated with a song he heard Alex working on. They began working on music together, resulting in their debut self-titled album in 2012.

With ""Danish & Blue,"" Lilacs & Champagne continue to push the boundaries of their sound. The album was recorded in a studio in Portland, Oregon and captures the essence of the duo's live performances. There's a rawness to the sound that's both exciting and infectious. The album is a mishmash of different sounds and genres, ranging from psychedelic rock to experimental hip-hop beats.

What makes ""Danish & Blue"" stand out is the duo's use of sampling. They take sounds from a variety of sources, including old instructional videos, and incorporate them into their music, resulting in a unique and sometimes strange listening experience. It's clear that Lilacs & Champagne doesn't just make music for the sake of it. Their music is carefully crafted and thought out, resulting in an album that's both captivating and introspective.

Personally, I found myself entranced by the opening track, ""Sour/Sweet."" The slow and deliberate beat is reminiscent of early trip-hop, with layered synths and a moody bassline. It's a song that demands attention, drawing the listener in and giving them a taste of what's to come. The rest of the album lives up to this opening track, with each song providing something different and exciting.

Overall, ""Danish & Blue"" by Lilacs & Champagne is an album that's worth the listen for any music lover who's not afraid to step outside their comfort zone. It's a bold and daring creation that showcases the talent of two musicians who aren't afraid to experiment with sound. They incorporate a range of sounds and genres to create a unique listening experience that's both nostalgic and new. At 6.3 out of 10, it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those who appreciate experimental rock music, ""Danish & Blue"" is a must-listen.","1.

Peder Mannerfelt,Equality Now EP,Electronic,7.1,December 15 2016,Louis Pattison,Contributor,"No subliminal messaging for Peder Mannerfelt: on Equality Now, he wears his politics on his record sleeve. Hailing from Stockholm, Mannerfelt is a skillful engineer and a tireless collaborator. As well as his solo production work, he performs as one half of analog synth duo Roll the Dice, has produced records for Blonde Redhead and Glasser under the name the Subliminal Kid, and played an integral role in Karin Dreijer Andersson’s Fever Ray. He shares a few common interests with Andersson—emancipatory politics, exotic rhythms, and Brothers Grimm dress-up. Playing live, he wears a waist-length wig that obscures his face, making him look like a sort of techno Rapunzel. The Equality Now EP marks Mannerfelt’s first output on Numbers, the Glasgow dance imprint that discovered Rustie and SOPHIE, among others. Its three tracks explore three quite different directions, while holding to a few base tenets: clever ideas, executed simply, with a minimum of gloss or clutter. The title track is crisp, propulsive techno produced with such economy that you probably couldn’t excise a single aspect without the whole thing disintegrating. Arid drums lock into a manic bounce, synth lines bend and flex into strange timbres and two synthetic voices—one male, one female—intone the world “equality”, mostly in unison, sometimes a tantalizing half-beat out of of step. Its repetition recalls a chant or a march: grassroots activism tailored for the dancefloor. While at first glance Equality Now’s productions can appear fairly simplistic, they often conceal ingenious elements. “Breaking Patterns,” the EP’s second track, is a borderline-crude acid number that contains rhythmic echoes of Mannerfelt’s 2015 LP T**he Swedish Congo Record—a sonic “research project” which attempted to fastidiously recreate 1930s field recordings of tribal music in the Belgian Congo using modern tools. Taut hand drums pound ceaselessly, as synthesizers spit out electronic zaps and distressed strings crawl mournfully across the frame. But most of the action happens on a microscopic level: beats form themselves into unusual polyrhythms that morph and reshape, while small twists of FX or a shifting mix suddenly jolt the track onto a new footing. Equality Now bows out with “Rules, Ropes & Strings,” an ambient piece that pares back the beats and ushers in slow tidal washes of shimmering texture. It’s a strangely sedate end for a record that is elsewhere out to enthuse or provoke. Hardly unusual for a figure as mercurial as Mannerfelt, though. This is music guided by impulse, not premeditation; music in which an idea is good, right up until the moment that it’s spent.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22688-equality-now-ep/,Numbers,2016.0,"The electronic music genre has always been a source of sonic intrigue and excitement, with the potential to create some of the most mind-bending and complex compositions out there. One of the latest artists to throw their hat into the ring is Peder Mannerfelt, who recently released the eclectic and thought-provoking ""Equality Now EP"". It is a mesmerizing body of work that seamlessly merges together various sonic textures and a deep political message.

For those unfamiliar with Mannerfelt, he's a Swedish musician, composer and producer, known for his technical prowess and sonic experimentation. He's spent years honing his craft, and it certainly shows in the quality of his productions. He's also known for his collaborations with other electronic music luminaries such as Fever Ray, Glasser, and Blonde Redhead, among others.

On the ""Equality Now EP,"" Mannerfelt takes on a theme that is both timely and crucial: the fight for equality. The opening track, ""I Stand Up and Fight,"" is a sonic call-to-arms with its distorted synths and driving percussion. This track sets the tone for an EP that is unafraid to challenge the listener and push the boundaries of electronic music.

Mannerfelt's impeccable production skills are evident throughout the EP, as he blends together elements of glitch, noise, and techno with precision and care. The complexity of his compositions is truly impressive, with each track feeling like a mini-journey through a sonic landscape.

One of the standout tracks, ""What Was Lost"" showcases Mannerfelt's ability to craft a haunting melody with an ominous undertone. The chopped up vocal samples and metallic synths create an eerie atmosphere that sticks with you long after the track has ended.

But it's not just the technical prowess that stands out on ""Equality Now EP."" It's the message behind it all. Mannerfelt is unapologetically political in his music, and this EP is no exception. Tracks like ""Equality Now"" and ""Beyond Borders"" deal with issues of inequality and the fight for human rights in powerful, confrontational ways.

Ultimately, what makes ""Equality Now EP"" a success is the balance that Mannerfelt strikes between technical proficiency and emotional depth. This is an album that feels like it has something to say, and it demands your attention. It's not just a collection of bangers, but a sonic journey that will leave you contemplating the state of the world.

In conclusion, Peder Mannerfelt's ""Equality Now EP"" is a powerful piece of electronic music that shows off the artist's impressive skills, but also his political voice. It's a call to action wrapped up in a mesmerizing and thought-provoking package. If you're a fan of electronic music that challenges you and makes you think, this EP is not to be missed.","1.

Laura Gibson,Beasts of Seasons,Folk/Country,7.2,March 17 2009,Matthew Solarski,Contributor,"The Pacific Northwest coughs up folksy, understated singer-songwriters by the coffeehouseful, which puts Portland-based Laura Gibson at risk of getting lost in the crowd. That would be a shame: Gibson has more to offer than vague descriptors like ""folksy"" and ""understated"" would suggest, and besides, her music is far better suited to a fireplace and a cup of warm apple cider than to your local Starbucks. Raised in a tiny coastal town, the soft-spoken songstress inched quietly into the scene in 2006 with If You Come to Greet Me, her refreshingly homespun if sometimes staid full-length debut. At first blush, the follow-up, Beasts of Seasons, doesn't appear to mark a significant departure from its predecessor. But unravel its seemingly rudimentary façade and you'll find an affecting study in contrasts from a songwriter a good deal more sophisticated than she's generally willing to let on. At the core of this study is a thematic concept of Gibson's own design. She's divided the record roughly in half; ""Communion Songs"" comprise the first part, while the second is made up of ""Funeral Songs"". Yet the two ideas are hardly mutually exclusive, a notion Gibson makes evident in the opening song, seven and a half minutes of gently cascading majesty entitled ""Shadows on Parade"". Apart from evoking the passage of time, the song's central image-- ""I will watch the shadows on parade""-- suggests the solitude, repose, and even isolation of the lonely and the waiting. With Gibson's ""parade"" description, however, the solitary activity of shadow-watching becomes something contrastingly communal and celebratory, a point underscored by the sample of a distant drum corps and crowd she and producer Tucker Martine (the Decemberists, Sufjan Stevens, Mudhoney) use to close out the song. It's the first of many little moments on the record that illustrate Gibson's willingness to see an image through at a time when a lot of similar songwriters are content to settle for what ""feels good"" or ""sounds good"" and move along. Shadow-watching gives way to other pensive activities as Beasts continues: reminiscence, daydreams, diary-like appeals to an unnamed ""other"", and the meditations on mortality that mark the ""Funeral"" half of the record. ""If these bare walls could sing,"" Gibson begins on the transitional track ""Funeral Songs""-- is she still watching and waiting for something even after the sunset has extinguished that parade of shadows? Indeed, a line about a body ""swaying like a drunkard"" and a trio of ruminations on Gibson's mother, father, and sister on closing track ""Glory"" are among the few moments where we're transported from Gibson's head to someplace outside. Yet for all of the singer's insularity, she never sounds alone on Beasts of Seasons, thanks to a mostly exquisite array of backing arrangements courtesy of a host of PDX luminaries, including Laura Veirs, labelmate Shelly Short, and members of the Decemberists, M. Ward's band, Menomena, and Norfolk & Western. ""Spirited"", easily the record's liveliest track, gets a boost from a chorus of ""OOH-ooh-OOH""s and booming percussion-work that keep things moving at a steady cantor, while ""Where Have All Your Good Words Gone?""'s fatalistic imagery rubs up against foreboding timpani rolls and chilly fiddle-playing that calls to mind Death bowing the buried to life in Saint-Saëns' Danse Macabre. As a singer, Gibson treats syllables with the same patience and loving precision a mosaic maker might put into cutting and arranging his/her tiles. It comes as little surprise, then, that words are a lyrical preoccupation of Gibson's throughout Beasts of Seasons. On ""Come By Storm"", the singer recalls how she ""took great care with words,"" and, later, how she loses herself to them. ""Spirited"" finds her describing how ""morning tends to... turn our words to smoke,"" while the aforementioned ""Where Have All Your Good Words Gone?"" has her grappling with the loss of a loved one by asking, ""Where are all the pleasures from the timbre of your tongue?"" Yet for all her talk of words, Gibson allows herself a fairly limited lexicon on Beasts of Seasons. If she knows some ""good"" ones like her sesquipedalian-prone onetime tourmate and fellow Portlander Colin Meloy, she wisely forgoes them in favor of repeated references to bodies and bones, trees and tongues, pictures, poems, and stories-- all of which lend the record a reflexivity that rewards repeat listens.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12816-beasts-of-seasons/,Hush,2009.0,"If you're a fan of folk and country music, then the latest album 'Beasts of Seasons' by Laura Gibson is certainly one that you should add to your collection. With a rating of 7.2 out of 10, this album definitely lives up to its hype.

Laura Gibson is no stranger to the music industry, having released her first album back in 2006. Beasts of Seasons is her sixth studio album, and it's clear from listening to it that she has honed her craft over the years. With every new release, Gibson manages to push the boundaries of what is possible within folk and country music, and Beasts of Seasons is no exception.

The album takes the listener on a journey through various emotions, from the haunting melodies of ""Slow Joke Grin"" to the upbeat, almost celebratory tones of ""I Don't Want Your Voice To Move Me"". What's particularly impressive about the album is the way in which the songs flow into one another, creating a cohesive and immersive listening experience.

While the album was recorded in Los Angeles, the songs were written during a particularly tumultuous period in Gibson's life, when she was grappling with health issues and the sudden loss of her mother. This personal struggle is evident in the raw emotions that underlie many of the album's tracks. In fact, some of the most poignant and heart-wrenching moments in the album come from the moments where Gibson bares her soul completely.

Overall, Beasts of Seasons is a fantastic addition to Laura Gibson's discography, and one that deserves to be listened to from start to finish. It's an emotional journey that is worth taking, and one that will leave you feeling both uplifted and reflective. So if you're in need of some soul-stirring folk and country music, this album is one that you should definitely give a listen.","1.

Coma Cinema,Posthumous Release,,6.1,June 14 2013,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Mat Cothran is from South Carolina, and his work as Coma Cinema strongly evokes a sense of the place. While he never references specific geography, the pervasive attitude in his music is one where the economy is down, the humidity is up, and everything moves a little too slowly as a result. Though Cothran moved from Spartanburg to the relatively metro capital of Columbia and recorded Posthumous Release in Los Angeles, it’s just a cleaner and clearer evocation of the same feeling that coursed through his earlier work: this isn’t the depression borne of unmet expectations and missed opportunities, it’s the deflation of boredom, of no opportunities. There is great art to be had in this quiet desperation, where a creative mind thinks anything can happen but his circumstances dictate that it rarely does. While Posthumous Release nails that feeling, it doesn’t always translate as compelling pop music. Though Cothran finds the minute differences between a sigh, a shrug, and a sulk throughout Posthumous Release, the album never drags. These songs are minimal in every aspect-- Cothran’s flat, sullen voice at the forefront of arrangements that are even mousier, sparse acoustic strums and brushed snares often parceled out in increments of two minutes or less. The quick cuts lend Posthumous Release a sense of immediacy that the underlying components can’t muster, giving the impression that their brevity is necessary to capture the moment rather than a result of rushed songwriting. Rather than compensating for the spare music, Cothran uses lyrics every bit as economically, which denies Posthumous Release much sense of release. There are a couple of dagger lyrics throughout that punctuate the record’s themes of failure, codependence, and despondence. But what Posthumous Release lacks is exposition, detail, or a sense of stakes in the matter. A line like ""cut myself at work"" implies a blue-collar gig where physical injury is a risk, but ""She Keeps it Alive"" leaves too much to the imagination; the same goes for the evocatively titled ""Lee (Columbine High Harmony)"", where Cothran admits, ""My wrists somehow forgot/ That quiet parking lot,"" and just lets it hang. The most striking parts of Posthumous Release recall the inventiveness of 2011's Blue Suicide, an album where you sensed a prolific artist straining against limitations of both budget and production know-how. “Satan Made a Mansion” shows Cothran’s knack for snappy alt-rock hooks while the wigged-out flange effects of “Burn a Church” exaggerate the vocal manipulation of “Her Sinking Sun”, thus far his strongest tune. Otherwise, the limitations of Posthumous Release are set into the foundation of its songs, many built upon two chords or revolving around a single, repeated line rather than a chorus. At best, they recall the throwback solo performances that would cut through the orchestral clutter on later Elliott Smith albums, though more often, there’s a perfunctory, boxed-in compositional method that’s more in line with mid-period eels. Posthumous Release doesn't lack ambition. Rather, it demonstrates the unique challenges inherent in making small music translate to an audience beyond the people immediately surrounding the ones who made it. If Cothran wanted to signify his ambition with bigger drums, string arrangements, or tremulous vocals, I imagine he would have done so. But when you look at the prime examples of small music done right-- Death Cab for Cutie’s We Have The Facts and We’re Voting Yes, Real Estate’s Days and Waxahatchee’s Cerulean Salt-- there’s a generosity within the lyrics and the hooks, a desire to share an experience rather than simply relate it. Cothran’s songs feel both insular and remote, staring off into the distance, clearly miserable but unwilling to really talk about it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18120-coma-cinema-posthumous-release/,"Fork and Spoon,Orchid Tapes",2013.0,"Coma Cinema's ""Posthumous Release"": A Haunting and Honest Exploration of Heartbreak

I was excited to listen to ""Posthumous Release"" by Coma Cinema, a band I have been following for a while. Known for their unique sound, the band's latest album does not disappoint. The melancholic melodies and haunting lyrics are both heartbreaking and beautiful.

Coma Cinema has a long history of making music that defies easy categorization, and this album is no exception. It's a mix of genres, but primarily falls under the category of nan, with elements of indie rock, shoegaze, and lo-fi. And while the album may not be the most accessible for casual listeners, it rewards those who take the time to dive in.

The album's creation story is as compelling as the music itself. ""Posthumous Release"" was created in the wake of bandleader Mat Cothran's breakup with his partner. This personal tragedy is present throughout the album's 10 tracks, which are raw, honest, and deeply personal. The songs feel like windows into Cothran's soul, and his pain is palpable.

It's not often that an album feels like a journey, but ""Posthumous Release"" is just that. The opening track, ""Ambrosia,"" sets the tone perfectly with its haunting melody and Cothran's vulnerable vocals. From there, the album takes the listener on a journey through stages of heartbreak, including loneliness, anger, and acceptance.

One of the album's standout tracks is ""Windowpane,"" with its minimalist instrumentation and Cothran's raw vocals. The song feels like a window into the artist's innermost thoughts, as he grapples with the aftermath of his breakup. Another standout track is ""Chimera,"" which features a beautiful melody and Cothran's emotive vocals.

Overall, ""Posthumous Release"" is a deeply emotional and cathartic listening experience. It's not easy to listen to at times, but it's a rewarding and moving album that will resonate with anyone who has experienced heartbreak. Coma Cinema has created a piece of art that speaks to the universal human experience of pain and loss, and they've done it with sincerity and vulnerability. While not perfect, ""Posthumous Release"" is definitely worth a listen for fans of indie rock and lo-fi music, and anyone who appreciates deeply personal and powerful songwriting. 

My personal rating for this album would be 7 out of 10.","1. Review A is longer and contains more complex language compared to Review B.

Wara From the NBHD,Kidnapped,,7.7,September 10 2014,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"Early on in Kidnapped, on ""Slangin"", Wara from the NBHD tells his older brother he plans on following him into drug dealing. His brother is having none of it: ""You think I like watchin my back, forever on my pivots?"" he demands. ""You think I like crack? You think I like shootin niggas?/ You think I like runnin' from the cops like a loser nigga?"" This sharp little scene indicates what makes Wara's first full-length release so powerful: The margins of the songs are filled with the voices of friends and family. ""I was one of the only kids with a father figure and a brother in my house,"" Wara told XXL recently. ""All of my friends didn’t really have fathers or brothers."" You can hear the community behind the Brooklyn-raised, Atlanta-based rapper/producer (the ""NBHD"" in his name just means ""neighborhood"") on Kidnapped, from the girlfriends he misses to the friends who tease him about wasting his time playing ""those stupid-ass piano chords"" (""Get In""). And those piano chords are everywhere on Kidnapped. Wara, who produced and wrote every track, focuses his music on keyboards, jazzy and spare. They're punctured by bone-dry, sharp snares that you feel in your teeth. There are guitar sounds, too, intentionally tinny synth-patched ones; the whole effect is to transport us back to Wara's childhood, the years of dirt bikes and Jeeps and Neptunes beats everywhere. On ""Scrilla"", he specifically recalls ""Nodding off to 'Bobby James,'"" from N.E.R.D.'s 2002 record In Search Of..., and Kidnapped almost feels like it sprung off fully formed from the head of that song alone. Within this blueprint, though, Wara has a lot of his own ideas. ""I’m a person that’s strictly into details about everything, from the cover art to the song titles to album titles to everything that’s based around the project,"" Wara said in that same XXL interview, and Kidnapped has a nicely fussed-over whole feeling as a project. Many songs switch through two sections, often in different keys; ""Slangin"" has a soulful, sticky hook that only arrives after all the verses, and it gains more power when the key changes beneath and instrumental details begin coloring in the edges. A mournful trumpet cuts through the sound of gunfire on ""Raw"". The song concepts are fresh: ""Annoyed"" is a love song, with a hook that captures first-relationship prickliness. ""I admit that I am a little cold-hearted, a little cold-hearted/ But most of the time, you're so fucking annoying,"" he complains. On the song's bridge (almost every song on Kidnapped has a chorus and a middle eight), he sings, ""Leave me alone/ But don't leave me alone, baby."" This idea—being unable to love, but yearning to—also cuts through on ""Fuck You Mean/Composure"": ""I wanna love, but don't know how to/ Can't quite break this lock, like I'm childproof,"" he observes. This theme gains resonance within Wara's dead-tired vocals. He's based in Atlanta, but his voice is pure New York, a mix of Queensbridge-menacing and Harlem-slick. Those are modes that don't allow much space for messy emotions to maneuver, which makes these little glinting peeks more affecting. He stumbles into a flat bar every once in awhile (""Cut the check like a scissor move"", from ""Slangin"", ""Too busy stacking up my cream like an empty cone"", from ""Piano Lessons""), but Wara is commanding on the mic, demonstrating telepathy with his drum patterns and great ear for juicy-sounding word combos—""characteristics of the chisel-hearted,"" for instance. Kidnapped balances a lot of different virtues, as Wara's a writer and a slick rapper, a talented producer who knows how to shape an album's worth of songs into a world.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19725-wara-from-the-nbhd-kidnapped/,Playin Four Keeps,2014.0,"If you're a fan of nan, Wara From the NBHD's album ""Kidnapped"" is definitely worth a listen. This album manages to capture the essence of the nan genre with precision and skill, leaving a lasting set of tracks that will impress even the most discerning music enthusiast.

Wara From the NBHD, also known as Wara, has been around since the early 2010s, crafting his own unique blend of rap and R&B. He's been steadily building a following, bolstered by support from fellow musicians and bloggers alike. With ""Kidnapped"", he's taken his craft to a new level, cementing his place as a leading voice in the genre.

On to the album itself, ""Kidnapped"" is a carefully crafted collection of tracks that presents Wara's lyrical and musical genius in full force. Each track reflects his unique experiences, with deep storytelling woven into every verse. The beats are top-notch, with a variety of synths, bass lines, and percussion working harmoniously to create an intoxicating mix of sounds.

As a personal fan of the album, I find myself returning to certain songs multiple times. ""Good God"" was a standout for me, featuring Wara's heavy drums and eerie synths. The track is both intense and melodic, with a singalong chorus that is sure to get stuck in your head. ""Brockett Road Rage"" is another favorite, with a more subdued beat that works in perfect contrast to Wara's aggressive rhymes.

One of the most impressive things about ""Kidnapped"" is how cohesive it is as an album. Each track flows smoothly into the next, creating a seamless listening experience that doesn't jar the listener out of the Wara's musical world.

Overall, I'd give this album a solid 8.5 out of 10. While Wara may not be a household name quite yet, ""Kidnapped"" is sure to put him on the map. If you haven't already checked it out, I highly recommend giving it a listen. It's a truly impressive journey through the mind of a talented musician.","1.

Tennis,Cape Dory,Rock,6.2,January 20 2011,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"In May 2010, when homemade indie pop of every stripe was deep in the throes of its baffling obsession with the beach, a new band was taking the music to the next logical place: the open sea. Tennis, we learned, were a married boy-girl duo from Denver, and their earliest circulated mp3s came with an odd story. After finishing college in Colorado, the couple sold their possessions, bought a sailboat, and embarked on an extended trip along the Eastern Seaboard. After returning to land, they began to write and record songs based on their experiences. Their music, as heard here on their full-length debut, touches on tide patterns and shifting winds and sandbars scraping beneath hulls; it also emphasizes the essential romance of the whole adventure-- that they went through it all together. Above all, Tennis strive to evoke an unnamed but certainly more innocent past. Everything about the project comes to us through a thick, triple-folded blanket of nostalgia. From the band's name (a sport that had its peak popularity in the 1970s and 80s) to the overall sound (girl-group pop is the basic template) to the record's cover to the choice of font, it all seems to yearn for one bygone day or another-- the 60s, the 80s, those seven months they spent on the water. The musical structures are straightforward, led by simple guitar lines and rhythms that are either waltz-time invitations to slow dance or more upbeat numbers with the familiar 1-2-pause-3 beat (think the Shirelles' ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"", the Chiffons' ""One Fine Day"", etc.) so evocative of when Brill Building songwriters ruled the airwaves. The muffled recording, on the other hand, might be an attempt to capture the feel of a cheap AM radio spilling out of a bungalow, but it mostly serves to make the music sound distant and indistinct. Tennis have a good ear for a tune and a solid understanding of how pop songs in this style fit together. The finger-snap-and-voice opening of ""Marathon"" has an appealingly peppy hook, the guitar twang in ""Long Boat Pass"" is of the proper vintage, and the melody on ""South Carolina"" has a nice build to the chorus break. Alaina Moore sings lead and has a likable voice, though her way of stretching vowels, when combined with the dull recording, sometimes makes the words hard to follow. Still, in single-song doses, the music on Cape Dory is pleasant, if not particularly memorable or expressive of anything in particular. The problem comes when the music is taken at album length. Even though these 10 songs clock in at less than 30 minutes, their cumulative effect is weirdly numbing. Part of it is up to the central conceit: An extended getaway on a sloop is nice enough image, but is the allure of this one fantasy enough to sustain a record? Not when there is so little personality emanating from the songs themselves. Say what you will about Jimmy Buffett, an artist most people I know consider to be among the most loathsome of the modern popular era, but his tales of island hopping and boat drinks have a sense of humor and an identifiable point of view. Tennis, conversely, seem content to hit their marks, replicate an established style, and let the associations that come with a familiar sound do the emotional work. Bizarrely, considering the detailed and unique backstory, which describes something these two went through and which most of us will never experience even if we wanted to, Cape Dory comes over as a depersonalized exercise. It seems too concerned about transmitting a very specific sound and getting all the nautical details right. So while the record is pretty and intermittently enjoyable, it feels one-note and ultimately flat.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15020-cape-dory/,Fat Possum,2011.0,"Welcome to the summer of Tennis! Cape Dory, the first album from Denver-based couple Patrick Riley and Alaina Moore, is a perfect escape from mundane daily routine.

It's one of those rare albums where listening to each track feels like standing at a different spot on a beach. You know how each spot offers a different vibe? Cape Dory has that in spades.

The album was recorded while Riley and Moore lived on a sailboat for eight months -- a story that seems to have real bearing on Cape Dory. The title itself comes from the name of a lighthouse they approached on their travels, and the tracks feel a little like they're illuminating little piece of their journey. The album reflects a sense of adventure, exploration and love all wrapped up in a neat little package.

Now, I usually stick to my genre of choice, but I also like to adventure into new horizons. Cape Dory, which is a rock album, gave me an opportunity to explore some new melodies and rhythms. I must say that I was impressed. It's not everyday you discover new elements in a genre that you've been following for years. 

Cape Dory comes to a strong start with ""Take Me Somewhere,"" with the sweet melody and jaunty lyrics that make one feel like they’re on a warm beach. With its catchy guitar riffs and soothing chorus, ""Marathon"" makes you want to run away and explore the world. ""Baltimore"" is equally charming, with its infectious piano and organ lines mixing with a lively rhythm, while ""Cape Dory"" showcases the duo’s sailing life.

With its strong sense of atmosphere, both musically and lyrically, Cape Dory feels like an escape from the outside world. The album has a huge emotional range, from the upbeat and romantic to the downtempo and subdued, and the songs themselves are well crafted and sustainably produced. 

While some people might be turned off by the simplicity of the lyrics, I find the honest and self-examining lyrics refreshing. It’s a tale of love, adventure, and self-discovery, and it paints a beautiful picture of the excitement and anticipation of a new journey.

Overall, this debut album from Tennis deserves more than its current rating of 6.2. It's simple, bittersweet, and sunny, making it a perfect fit for summer nights and adventurous souls. Take it from me, if you're looking for a break from your daily routine, this album will transport you to a sandy beach where your toes sink in soft sand, and music plays in your soul.","1.

Rosali ,Trouble Anyway,Folk/Country,7.2,July 14 2018,Allison Hussey,Contributor,"Our world is divided into binaries, useful and otherwise: female and male, hot and cold, weak and strong, hard and soft. The structures they offer for organizing our thoughts and lives are simple, if reliably interrupted by reality. And sometimes we could all use a break from them. On her second album, Trouble Anyway, Philadelphia singer-songwriter Rosali Middleman rejects binary thinking with ease in a series of verdant, contemplative rock numbers. Within their soft exteriors, each of her songs has a steely core built from lyrics that examine heartache and vulnerability. The central theme of Trouble Anyway is right there in the title: Middleman touches on trouble with love, with life, with figuring your way through the world. But she manages all of it with a sense of calm that ripples across the record, keeping her tone cool and even-keeled for the duration. Even a sighing line like, “The trouble I found lying in your arms is the trouble I’d be troubled with anyway,” from “The Trouble,” feels like a distant, clear-eyed assessment—Middleman doesn’t seem to regret her romantic ordeal. On “Who’s to Say,” she reclaims her power by challenging the roles foisted on her by an unnamed antagonist. She ends the song by coolly noting that she’s no longer lonely without his restrictive presence in her life. But Middleman’s calm doesn’t stem from indifference. Rather, it feels like she’s laying her cards on the table in order to narrate her own game of emotional solitaire. Instead of conveying her feelings through grand gestures, Middleman reveals her heart in the granular details of her songs: She sings the title of “I Wanna Know” with the familiar tension of carefully tempered disappointment, acknowledging the nagging feelings of futility that accompany heartbreak in the lines, “Tears, they rolled away/Cried a lake/What am I today?/Cry a little longer.” Middleman’s 2016 debut, Out of Love, was relaxed and mostly acoustic, save for unobtrusive electric guitar and light percussion. But for her Trouble Anyway backing band, she recruited a larger cohort of talented pals, including harpist Mary Lattimore, Nathan Bowles on banjo and drums, more drums from the War on Drugs’ Charlie Hall, and guitars courtesy of Purling Hiss’ Mike Pollize and Paul Sukeena of Spacin’. Collectively, they animate Middleman’s songs without overpowering them. On the eight-minute “Rise to Fall,” she benefits from the crew’s heady instrumental heft as she sings about uncertainty and alarm; the track’s jagged guitar lines, matched with flecks of harp and violin, capture an impressive range of nuanced emotion. “If I Was Your Heart” is the album's glimmering jewel, striking a satisfying balance between lighthearted charm and profound sincerity. Lattimore’s sparkling harp touches make for a tasteful garnish atop the tune’s comfortable sway, and even as Middleman asks, “Who’s at fault for fading the lights?,” the music maintains a hopeful undercurrent. Middleman leaves the what-if of the titular refrain unanswered, and that lack of resolution feels refreshing—the song creates open-ended space for daydreaming rather than hammering for a hard answer. Trouble Anyway only falters when tracks like “Who’s to Say” and “I Wanna Know” wander into extended outros that linger too long. But patience pays off, as Middleman leaves listeners room to contemplate their own tribulations throughout the record. Closing number “Maybe I’m Right” is its most stripped-down and succinct track, recalling Out of Love’s simplicity. It’s easy to share Middleman’s confidence, even on unsteady ground, as she offers a final mandate of sorts: “Starting to question the path of a line/Maybe I’m right.” She makes a convincing case.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rosali-trouble-anyway/,"Scissor Tail,Spinster",2018.0,"If you're a fan of folk and country music, you'll certainly want to check out Rosali's latest album release, 'Trouble Anyway'.

Summer at Shatter Creek,All the Answers,Rock,3.8,March 30 2005,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"Summer at Shatter Creek is an awful name for a band. Worse still when once you learn that it's just a mere alias for some moody, does-it-all indie-rock guy named Craig Gurwich. The moniker is too long and the alliteration involved makes it hard to say even two times fast. You could shorten it to Shatter Creek but that would be like moving from the heart of Bad Band Name City to the seedy outskirts. But such quibbles would be moot if Gurwich's apparition-folk somehow rose above his fifth-rate Skeet Ulrich slasher-flick handle on his second full-length. No such luck. Mired in empty waves of echo and sleepy-time acoustic-slosh arrangements, the singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer matches the crushing boredom of his nickname as he listlessly indulges in his own banal depressions throughout much of All the Answers. ""I used to be optimistic,"" croons the California man in a lofty, angelic way that recalls a seriously NyQuil-ed Jim James of My Morning Jacket, ""But I can't lie/ All I see is the dying of the earth, junk piles of trash and disease."" Well, ok! If ""Optimistic"" was some kind of post-modern, post-liberal, self-reflexive take on overbearing pessimism, it could be worth a single tear. But as is, its downtrodden lyrical bluntness and airy atmospherics waft and sway without much impact. The song's noisy and dissonant outro is a welcome respite from the flat haze, too bad such restless moments are disappointingly rare. Gurwich's chief strength is his voice and, as producer, the multi-tracked harmonies he creates with it. Delicate and pretty, his vulnerable wail connects on the few backwoods ballads that offer a pulse, weak as it may be. The album's title track offers an appealing, slow-motion melody with the singer finding a comfort in the naive helplessness of his own trembling delivery. Still, such helplessness easily turns into a pathetic desperation with lines like, ""You should pay more attention to me."" Back-to-back insomnia cures ""You Don't Have to Be Perfect to Be Loved"" and ""Rebecca"" mark the record's crusty-eyed lowpoint. The former lulls with the requisite finger-pick strum and whisper vox along with a Legend of Zelda-esque whistle refrain; while listening, I half expected gnome-y old-timers to walk out of my closest, do a lame dance around my bed and tumble to the floor. With lyrics like, ""You were so young and pretty/ You were something else, yeah/ But you never felt quite pretty,"" the latter's twinkly-piano-propelled analysis of a young woman will make you long for the edgy insightfulness of Norah Jones. Maybe the Craigster should learn to divvy out his many responsibilities (he also designed the album's artwork!) in a more appropriate manner for his next project because this one-man-band thing isn't doing much for my ears or, based on the record's dour words, his personal life. Get some friends. Find a nice girl. Plug in the guitar every once and a while. None of us have All the Answers, but we can usually muster up a couple good ones when prodded.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7562-all-the-answers/,Badman,2005.0,"All the Answers by Summer at Shatter Creek: A Look into the Band's Journey and Growth

If you're looking for an album that's raw, edgy, and full of heart, then Summer at Shatter Creek's latest release, All the Answers, might just be what you need. This rock album might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it certainly packs a punch for those who appreciate the genre.

Before diving into the music, let's take a look at the band's history. Summer at Shatter Creek formed in 2012, hailing from the small town of Bentham in the North of England. The band was initially made up of three musicians: lead vocalist and guitarist Tom, bassist Charlie, and drummer Alex. The group's early music was heavily influenced by classic rock, but as they played more shows and honed their skills, their sound evolved into something altogether different.

Fast-forward to 2021, and Summer at Shatter Creek has grown from a three-man band to a five-piece outfit, with the addition of second guitarist James and keyboardist Sophie. All the Answers is the group's third album, following their debut, No Time Like the Present, and their sophomore release, Dead Ends and New Beginnings. Fans of the band will recognize their signature sound, but the group has also experimented with new styles and sounds on this latest album.

Now, onto the music. All the Answers is a thirteen-track album that clocks in at just over forty minutes. The album's title track serves as the opener, with a riff-heavy introduction that immediately sets the tone for the rest of the album. Tom's gravelly voice provides a perfect complement to the guitar work, and the rest of the band keeps the energy high throughout the song.

One stand-out track is ""Echoes,"" which starts off slow and builds into a powerful chorus. The addition of Sophie's keyboards provides depth to the track and adds a different dimension to the band's sound. Another notable song is ""Breaking Point,"" which has a catchy guitar riff and a chorus that's easy to sing along to.

However, not all the songs on the album are equally as strong. Tracks like ""Lost in the Sauce"" and ""Fading Fast"" fall a bit flat, with less memorable melodies and less impactful lyrics. Overall, though, the album has a good mix of songs that vary in pacing and intensity.

As a fan of rock music, I enjoyed All the Answers on the whole. I appreciated the band's growth and evolution in sound, and their willingness to try out new things. Though not all the songs hit the mark, the album as a whole is cohesive and enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend it for fans of classic rock, as well as those who enjoy more modern rock bands like Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys.

In summary, Summer at Shatter Creek's All the Answers is a solid addition to their discography. The band's growth and experimentation are evident, and the album has enough strong tracks to make it worth a listen.","1.

Field Music,Field Music,Rock,7.6,August 15 2005,Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"By now, the beaches of Sunderland, England, must be redolent with post-punk herky-jerky. To be sure, native sons Field Music have much in common with the Mackems that came before-- not least their members, who include one former Futurehead plus a current Maxïmo Park drummer-- but rather than assail us with angularity, the region's latest exports aptly prefer prettiness. Indeed, ""You're So Pretty"", their 12-song, 38-minute debut's art-pop finale, is the album's best track, and also its buzzing, ornamented, just-too-brief-enough synecdoche. That song, like the album's other epiphanies, is a sparkling construct of whirring guitars, eccentric percussion, windmill-tilting bass, and Andrew Moore's piano embellishments. Dual lead vocalists Peter and David Brewis swap quixotic, often-falsetto harmonies as indebted to Pet Sounds as to ""Hounds of Love"". The lyrics tend toward the commonplace, which if not beside the point pretty much is the point: ""You're so pretty/ I could talk to you all night"", chime the Brothers Brewis, their sweet-nothings granted the wings of soaring melody. Second single ""You Can Decide"" is the band's most immediately compelling track, with copious oohing, spastic handclaps, and eloquently stuttering chorus: ""So if you know, you know, you know/ Let me."" ""Got to Write a Letter"" benefits from slippery acoustic guitars and fairly sharp wordplay, though none as adroit as ""I've given up thinking"" from the album's rare sad song, the still-sun-dappled ""Like When You Meet Someone Else"". Opener ""If Only the Moon Were Up"" introduces a smattering of Revolver horn oompahs and GeoHa guitarisms ca. Abbey Road. I still say stupendous first single ""Shorter Shorter"" was, true to its name, the latter album's flip-side shortened, haunted and harried by imminent mortality. Meanwhile, the band's self-consciously complex, maximalist arrangements and Sparks- or even Yes-like vocal heights call up that suddenly-not-dirty (if prefixed with ""hyper"") word: prog. I'm just saying. After their first two singles, it's hard not to be let down by good-enoughs like the ambitious, briefly cacophonous ""Tell Me Keep Me"", string-laden ""Luck Is a Fine Thing"", and staccato, saxophone-blearing ""17"". More ephemeral than Clor, more cerebral than the Rakes, Field Music has, like the Magic Numbers, fashioned a distinctive voice and near-perfect arrangements, but the songs hint at greatness nearly as often as they achieve it. Pretty is pretty nice, but the promise of true beauty makes tough critics of us all.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3344-field-music/,Memphis Industries,2005.0,"If you're looking for the perfect mix of rock, pop, and indie sensibilities, Field Music's self-titled album is the one for you. This British band, formed by brothers David and Peter Brewis in 2004, has been crafting their unique sound for almost two decades, and this album perfectly showcases their growth and evolution.

The record opens with ""A New Town"", which sets the tone for the album with its catchy melodies and intricate guitars. It's clear that Field Music has a knack for creating layered soundscapes that are both fun and accessible. Moving on to ""Field Music (Measure)"", the album's lead single, we're treated to the band's signature soaring vocals and driving rhythms, proving that they're not afraid to experiment with different sounds and styles.

One of my personal favorites on the album is ""Share A Pillow"", a dreamy and introspective track that's filled with lush strings and emotive vocals. It's a reflective track that perfectly captures the introspective nature of the band's songwriting. Another standout track is ""Let's Write a Book"", which features a driving bassline and infectious hooks that keep us moving along.

Of course, you can't talk about Field Music without mentioning their impeccable musicianship. The band clearly knows their way around their instruments and have a knack for building complex and satisfying arrangements. The soaring guitars and intricate drumming on ""Effortlessly"" are a testament to this.

Overall, Field Music's self-titled album is an impressive showcase of what this talented band is capable of. With driving rhythms, catchy melodies, and introspective lyrics, this record is a must-listen for anyone who loves great rock music with a lot of heart.

The Magnetic Fields,69 Love Songs,Rock,9.0,September 7 1999,Nick Mirov,,"There's only one question that really needs to be asked of 69 Love Songs: is it a brilliant masterpiece or merely very, very good? The title alone is enough to send music geeks the world over into a foamy-mouthed, epileptic frenzy. 69 songs equals 3 CDs equals nearly three solid hours of new Magnetic Fields material-- think of it! That's more than some notable bands released in their entire existence. Add that to the fact that the Magnetic Fields actually followed through with their concept without turning it into the indie-pop equivalent of Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music. You see, I have this theory that music critics are suckers for novelty, and there isn't much in this world that's more novel than 69 Love Songs. It borders on being a prop in a Mark Leyner story-- it's hyperreal and excessive, yet perfectly plausible when you consider how weird reality is. Because of this, the album never feels like a ponderous, pretentious artistic statement (unlike most multi-CD releases). Stephin Merritt and company sound like they approached this ridiculously ambitious project with the most casual of airs, idly plucking melody after divine melody out of the air like low-hanging fruit from a tree. It's how pop music should sound, really: so natural and feather-light that you never notice the amount of effort that went into it. Therein lies the paradox of 69 Love Songs-- it's such a basic style of music that it's easy to dismiss it as ""just pop music."" Of course, that's what it is, so should it really deserve such high praise? Should it rank among the best albums of the 1990s? Or is it too bizarre to be considered culturally important? I mean, Abbey Road is a pretty weird album, too. Then again, Abbey Road isn't three hours long. Regardless, Stephin Merritt has proven himself as an exceptional songwriter, making quantum leaps in quality as well as quantity on 69 Love Songs. This incarnation of the band doesn't feature much of the densely layered, burbling electro-pop that they're best known for; in its stead are sparser, more acoustic songs that sound as if they're being played on actual instruments by a group of actual musicians (as opposed to Merritt himself playing mad scientist with effects racks and overdubs). It may initially seem like this stylistic decision came due to budget restrictions-- if you're recording that many songs, you can't blow too much money on any one track. But it's probably more likely that Merritt finally realized the limits of tinny synths and drum machines. On the Fields' previous outing, Get Lost, you can hear Merritt beginning to lean toward simpler, more elegant arrangements; 69 Love Songs could easily be seen as a continuation of that trend. Merritt also ensures that the listener will never get bored with any one sound, trading off vocal duties with four other singers and deploying a mind-boggling array of instruments: ukulele, banjo, accordion, cello, mandolin, piano, flute, guitars of all shapes and sizes, a dumpster full of percussion toys, and the usual setup of synths and effects. Among other things. And the songs themselves? Well, I could write a thesis dissecting each and every song on this album, but that would take months. As a prism refracts light into a spectrum of colors, 69 Love Songs not only refracts love into a spectrum of emotions, but also refracts the love song itself into a spectrum of musical forms. There's a duet between a dysfunctional Sonny and Cher (""Yeah! Oh Yeah!""), a country-gospel tune confusing religious and secular love (""Kiss Me Like You Mean It""), and an amusingly light-hearted tale of a soldier's drunken tryst (""The Night You Can't Remember""). There's giddy lust (""Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits""), romantic longing (""Come Back from San Francisco""), sleazy leering (""Underwear""), and resignation and despair (""No One Will Ever Love You""). There are genre exercises such as faux-beatnik jazz (""Love is Like Jazz""), Paul Simon-ish world music (""World Love""), Gilbert and Sullivan-style mincing harpsichord (""For We are the King of the Boudoir""), Merritt's cartoony, day-glo interpretation of punk rock (""Punk Love""), Scottish folk (""Wi' Nae Wee Bairn Ye'll Me Beget""), and a brief Philip Glass tribute (""Experimental Music Love""). There are also plenty of archetypal Magnetic Fields songs, with those trademark deadpan drama-queen vocals, casually depressive lyrics, and clever rhymes. But Merritt also shows he can pen some surprisingly sincere, moving ballads (""Busby Berkeley Dreams,"" ""The Book of Love""), too. So, back to the original debate. You know that old saying about the whole being more than the sum of its parts? The sum of the parts of 69 Love Songs adds up exactly to its whole. No more, no less. Each song contains its own small epiphany, but they never quite add up to the one big sweeping epiphany that you'd hope for. That's because it's impossible to reconcile the concept of 69 Love Songs with its execution; it's simply too big. That might sound like a cop-out, but this is truly an album you can get lost in. The individual songs will inevitably distract you from a big-picture interpretation of the album. Of course, the Magnetic Fields don't concern themselves with such matters; they promised us 69 love songs, and that's what they delivered. That it's actually worth the exorbitant $35 price tag is a bonus.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5041-69-love-songs/,Merge,1999.0,"If you're looking for an album that is both catchy and thought-provoking, '69 Love Songs' by The Magnetic Fields is the perfect pick. As a fan of many different genres of music, I found myself constantly coming back to this album for its depth of lyrical content and diverse instrumentation.

The Magnetic Fields, led by the eccentric and gifted songwriter Stephin Merritt, has been making music since the early 90s. The band is known for their quirky and unconventional approach to pop music, often incorporating elements of country, folk, and even electronic music into their sound.

'69 Love Songs' was released in 1999 and remains one of their most beloved works. The album is exactly what it sounds like - 69 original songs about love, each with its own unique perspective and spin. From the upbeat and catchy ""Absolutely Cuckoo"" to the heartbreaking ballad ""All My Little Words,"" the album's range of emotions is truly impressive.

As someone who has listened to this album many times over, I can say that some of my favorite tracks include ""I Don't Believe in the Sun,"" ""The Way You Say Good-Night,"" and ""Papa Was a Rodeo."" Each of these songs tells a deeply personal story about love, but does so with a cleverness and wit that is rare in music these days.

One thing that sets '69 Love Songs' apart from other albums about love, is its willingness to explore the many different facets of this complex emotion. There are songs about the thrill and excitement of new love, but also about the pain and heartache that often comes with it. Merritt's lyrics are often clever and ironic, but also poignant and deeply moving at times.

In terms of the music itself, '69 Love Songs' is a fantastic showcase of The Magnetic Fields' diverse talents. The album includes everything from lush orchestrations and intricate piano melodies to twangy guitars and foot-stomping rhythms. The variety of sounds is a testament to the band's willingness to experiment and push boundaries.

Overall, I would rate '69 Love Songs' a solid 9 out of 10. While it may not be for everyone, the album is a true gem of indie rock music and a shining example of what can be achieved when a group of talented musicians set out to make something truly unique and special.","1.

Matthew Herbert,Score,Electronic,6.7,April 4 2007,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"Though he first earned a rep as a proto-microhouse producer possessed of an uncommonly witty sampler, Matthew Herbert has become best known for records that sample a hundred people eating apples and then turns the crunches and slurps into a techno track with lyrics by John Pilger. So you may be surprised to learn that Score is just that, a collection of music Herbert penned for a series of independent films from 1997 to 2007. Come to it expecting the man's usual mix of musique concrète-style sampling, torch songs, and leftist politicking, and you might walk away disappointed. On the other hand, I thought the photo of a collapsed house on the back cover was just Herbert punning on this album's lack of beats, until I noticed in the credits that it's taken from post-July War Lebanon in 2006. No matter the venue, Herbert can't resist a little social commentary, even subtly. Score is more in line with Goodbye Swingtime, Herbert's somewhat unfairly maligned big band jazz album from 2003, albeit minus the guest singers that were there to liven up what was otherwise a very faithful, if somewhat arch, homage to the swing era. Since the music on Score both pre- and post-dates Goodbye Swingtime, it's clear that jazz has long been an abiding interest for Herbert. (Of course, that was also more than evident from his house singles.) His métier here is post-war Rat Pack vehicles and Cold War thrillers, their scores a mix of then-current cocky American jazz cool and a continental European black market intrigue and lovelorn post-Luftwaffe ennui. ""Café de Flore (Trio Reprise)"" is an accordion-led sketch of a Parisian cobblestone square, and ""Rivoli Shuffle"", a nimble dance for piano and brass, is the spitting musical image of a two-bit, card-shuffling hustler in a cheap sharkskin suit. Herbert's musical research into the era means his orchestral jazz is certainly competent, but often the album is at its best on tracks like the analogue Aphex Twin wistfulness of ""End"" and album opener ""Funereal,"" a mournful miniature for strings that does a fine job of evoking a rain soaked graveyard--just right for opening or ending your film noir. At 10:29, ""Rendezvous"" is both the album's most ambitious and most idiosyncratic piece of music. A barely audible ambient burbling of a beat lurks in the background throughout, topped with full-on choral writing for a male and female ensemble that shifts unexpectedly into tense moments of constricted techno, like a high Catholic mass suddenly breaking into a Clear Records 12-inch. The album's low point is a 2001 take on ""Singin' in the Rain"", fine as a muted instrumental jazz reading of the cinematic chestnut but made silly by the buzzes, hums, and glitch-y CD skips and stutters that Herbert adds as window-dressing. It's like a Hollywood agent's idea of ""futuristic jazz."" On the other hand, the guitar of ""Blood and Hair"", likewise poked and prodded with his computer, is flush with enough Galouises smoke and digital unease to suggest it might be a good choice for a modern remake of The Third Man. (Note to Hollywood: Please don't remake The Third Man. You'd probably cast Vince Vaughn as Harry Lime or something.) Like 1996's 100 Lbs., reissued last year, Score will be something of a curio to anyone who hasn't already swallowed the Herbert kool-aid or who isn't a already a ravenous consumer of soundtracks and scores. Unlike the bump-and-flicker of Herbert's earliest deep house singles collected on 100 Lbs., however, Score won't even satisfy the beat heads, though if you were an enterprising, Ableton-owning mp3jay, you could edit the two together and probably get something close to the man's more recent albums, where the slickly realized jazz pastiches and Nelson Riddle-on-a-Tescos-budget strings are deployed as part of Herbert's lush dance grooves. But though we may yet learn that these seemingly straightforward set-pieces and pretty musical backdrops are actually made not from actual strings but from Herbert sampling a duck's quacks or the shouts of an anti-war demonstration, Score is perhaps the least conceptual, most functional thing the man has ever put his name to. Maybe rent the flicks first.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10071-score/,!K7,2007.0,"If you are a music fanatic who is always in search of new and innovative sounds, then the Electronic genre might appeal to you. But if you are looking for something truly unique, then you cannot go wrong with Matthew Herbert's ""Score"".

Matthew Herbert has been gathering a following since the early 2000s, and rightfully so. With his unique blend of electronic and experimental soundscapes, Herbert has carved out a niche for himself in the world of music. Starting out as a DJ and producer in the UK, he has since released a number of albums and EPs, each one different from the last. With ""Score"", released in 2020, Herbert once again showcases his mastery of the electronic genre.

So what makes ""Score"" stand out? For starters, Herbert's approach to music-making is truly fascinating. He attributes sounds to specific events, objects or people and uses these as building blocks to create a sonic tapestry that is both intricate and captivating. For example, using recordings of his son's first ever words or the sound of skipping rope, Herbert has crafted a musical journey that is both personal and universal.

The album starts with the track ""Hello"", which sets the tone for the rest of the album. Eerie whispers and faint gusts of wind create an almost hypnotic effect that pulls you in. Then, something happens: a burst of drums and horns signal the start of ""Between the Lines"". A truly bizarre but mesmerizing mix of sounds that incorporates everything from a cacophony of violins to the sound of bullet shells hitting the ground, ""Between the Lines"" is an instant highlight of ""Score"".

Another standout moment is the track ""Megaphone"". It starts with a simple drum beat and gradually evolves into a soundscape that incorporates everything from birdsong to children's laughter. It's almost like Herbert is painting a sonic picture of a summer day at a park. It's beautiful and inventive.

However, for all its innovation, ""Score"" isn't perfect. Some tracks tend to blur together, and the overall experience can be a little overwhelming at times. The album is also, at times, too experimental for its own good. Though, to Herbert's credit, this is a risk he's willing to take.

All in all, ""Score"" is an album that is well worth checking out. It's a courageous and highly creative work, and Herbert should be commended for taking such a bold approach to his music. With a rating of 6.7 out of 10, it falls just short of reaching the heights that some of his previous works have, but it is still a great album that will reward those who invest the time to listen to it.","1.

Portastatic,Who Loves the Sun OST,"Experimental,Rock",7.4,June 8 2006,David Raposa,Contributor,"On his news blog, Portastatic's Mac of all trades promises that his second film soundtrack will contain some ""good old rocking out"" among the usual filmic elements-- cellos, oboes, etc.-- so as to not disorient those that abide his creative friskiness but pledge allegiance to Superchunk. That's a damn shame, because as much as I enjoy the rockier efforts of Mr. McCaughan, this disc is one place where they aren't welcome. The trailer for this film features one such ""rocking"" track-- it's not officially on the soundtrack, but in this context, it sounds like the sort of middling indie rock you'd find on the middling soundtrack of a middling indie film. Jury's still out on whether Who Loves The Sun? qualifies as ""middling""-- it's currently playing the festival thing in preparation for a fall release. But bland rock moves aside, this soundtrack is a nice surprise, exceeding expectations when it eschews the expected. ""Surprise"" is a relative term, of course. That McCaughan wrote most of this music for instruments he's not proficient in is besides the point. Anyone that's been following his moves over the past 10 years has become accustomed to his use of strings and other orchestral accoutrements, as well as his expanding compositional palette. Still, even the most dedicated fan might do a double take when they hear the guy that wrote ""Why Do You Have to Put a Date On Everything?"" turn to cello and a charmingly clumsy acoustic guitar for this disc's first track, ""Will's Return"". That double-take will probably turn into a full-on gawk when they hear Mac unfurl a melodic theme that sounds as good essayed on piano (""Once Nice Piano"") as it does on upright bass and flute (""Nice One"") or acoustic guitar and oboe (""Nice Strums""). It's a pleasant tune containing a wry bittersweet wrinkle, which makes it perfect to reprise in a film about estranged friends and lovers reuniting. In fact, a bittersweet feeling permeates every inch of this soundtrack, from the title of the film (taken from a highpoint of the VU's Loaded album) to the song titles (""The Sunset Rock"", ""Seems Like a Long Time Ago"") to the music itself. ""Snake Music"", a solo piano piece, possess a haunting echo that recalls the key-tickling of another reformed Chapel Hill indie dude, Crooked Fingers' Eric Bachmann. Gorgeous downbeat tunes like ""Do You Want To Know?"" or the album's closing track ""Older Summer"", with their brushed drums and autumn-sweater haze, reflect shades of Yo La Tengo's more nostalgic work. Even the half-minute-long ""Fighting Music"", played primarily on a toy xylophone in a peppy power-pop style, conveys that sense of reminiscence and nostalgia. McCaughan's so successful at establishing this mood that when those few-and-far-between rock moments finally arrive (in the form of two ""Chase"" songs), they come off like farts during a wedding ceremony. It might have been the rock'n'roll that gives McCaughan the freedom to write movies soundtracks, but in this instance he's better off forgetting that he ever rocked.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9094-who-loves-the-sun-ost/,Merge,2006.0,"If you're looking for an album that's a little off the beaten path, ""Who Loves the Sun OST"" by Portastatic is definitely worth checking out. This experimental rock album has a unique sound that blends indie rock with experimental elements, creating a sound that's both familiar and innovative.

First, let's take a look at the band's history. Portastatic was founded in 1992 by Mac McCaughan, who's also known for his work in the band Superchunk. Over the years, Portastatic has gone through a number of different lineups and musical iterations, but one thing that's remained constant is McCaughan's commitment to making thoughtful, interesting music. In some ways, ""Who Loves the Sun OST"" is a reflection of that commitment.

The album itself was created as a soundtrack to the independent film ""Who Loves the Sun,"" which was directed by Matt Bissonnette. McCaughan was asked to create the soundtrack, and he took the opportunity to experiment with different sounds and styles. The result is an album that's somewhat eclectic, but still cohesive.

As for my personal experience of the album, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The album's opening track, ""Sour Shores,"" immediately drew me in with its driving rhythm and catchy guitar riff. From there, the album takes some unexpected turns, like the jazzy sounds of ""Blackness of the Night"" and the dreamy, atmospheric ""Escape Plans"".

Overall, I appreciate how the album incorporates so many different sounds and styles. There's something for everyone on this album, whether you're a fan of indie rock, jazz, or experimental music. That being said, some tracks do feel a little disconnected from each other, and the album as a whole lacks a strong sense of coherence at times. I also wish that there were more standout tracks on the album - while there are certainly some memorable moments, there aren't any tracks that particularly stand out as ""hits.""

All in all, I would give ""Who Loves the Sun OST"" a solid 7.4 out of 10. It's not a perfect album, but it's certainly an interesting one that's worth a listen. Fans of Portastatic or experimental rock in general will likely appreciate the album's unique sound and creative vision.","1.

Meek Mill,Wins and Losses,Rap,7.4,July 27 2017,Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,"Meek Mill spent much of the last two years trying to understand how a ghostwriting bombshell dropped mid-Twitter rant could backfire so tremendously. Less than 140 characters completely changed his trajectory. When he exposed Drake as a Quentin Miller mouthpiece, he couldn’t have anticipated the blowback—“Charged Up” and “Back to Back”—would send his career spiraling. Long after the matter was closed he was still rapping about it constantly, as if dazed and trying to make sense of what happened. Many deemed the series of Drake disses, which would come to include  the “Summer Jam Screen” moment and “Summer Sixteen,” as resounding losses, the type rappers don’t recover from (ask Ja Rule). Earlier this year, the other shoe dropped: Meek and Nicki Minaj unceremoniously split after two years of dating, and the subs went flying in song. Minaj invited Drake to send stray shots at Meek on “No Frauds.” These moments have come to define Meek for many who were only casually invested in the first place. He is continuously addressing these setbacks because no one will let him forget about them. His third album, Wins and Losses, assesses what it really means to be defeated. In an interview with Atlanta’s Streetz 94.5, he clarified the album’s ambitions: “I just wanted to give people a real perspective of my life, what we call wins and what we call losses. I lost my case, we lost Lil Snupe, Chino lost his brother. Where we come from, that’s a loss. When you talk L’s and W’s, you get an L, that mean you got life in jail. It’s critical. It ain’t what they talking about.” Much like his major label debut, Dreams and Nightmares, his new album juxtaposes rap dreams and hood realities, but draws more deliberate distinctions. He recognizes rapping as salvation from street life, not some gladiatorial clash inside an echo chamber. Meek makes the case there’s more than one way to win, and that being bested in the rap coliseum isn’t nearly as devastating a blow as seeing close friends die. Subliminal shots don’t hit the way real ones do. The album is a comeback by any measure, honest and gripping. Rap is largely a perception game (as Meek’s MMG boss can attest to), and on Wins and Losses Meek attempts to change his narrative using a different perspective. Here, he isn’t Drake’s also-ran or Nicki Minaj’s ex; he’s the ultimate underdog, a battle-rapping corner boy who came from nothing and gained everything. “I just made like 20 Ms, they say it’s an L (what?)/Niggas prayin’ that I fall and I wish ‘em well,” he raps on “Issues,” making light of his perceived misfortune and those who want to see him fail. The message is even clearer on “1942 Flows”: “I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams/So I’ma give it to ‘em every time I’m on the scene.” Chasing dreams is Meek’s guiding principle. He’s always been about triumph in the face of adversity. He finds solace in knowing he’s achieved all he set out to, and that he wasn’t even supposed to be here. Aside from trading in his Rolex for a Patek, and Maybachs for Wraiths, Meek settles back into his usual rhythm on Wins and Losses. He wasn’t rapping poorly on his 4/4 EP or his DC4 mixtape, but Drake had taken up so much space in Meek’s consciousness (and ours) that he was dictating many of Meek’s raps and how people chose to listen to them. Across 67 minutes and 17 tracks, Meek gets back to what he does best, diagramming a tumultuous life lived—praying for bricks, prison stints, starting out broke and earning millions, losing a brother and memorializing him in ice. He sees stunting as a salute to the dead. “Rockin’ all this ice, I’m just tryna hide my scars tho/Somethin’ bout that Wraith and them lights, how them stars glow/Give me motivation,” he raps on “These Scars.” Alongside Young Thug on “We Ball,” a sparse thumper driven by Thug accents, he laments lost comrades, vowing to honor them and provide for those still living. “Heavy Heart” indicts betrayers and defiantly challenges naysayers. He’s sharp and adrenalized, even in mourning. The most moving Meek bars use success as a lens through which to understand misery, reflecting on a distressing past, measuring the distance between fame and struggle, and finding the overlaps. It is a constant balance, as displayed on “Heavy Heart”: “Shit I’d rather work and walk ‘fore I ride luxury with niggas that don't fuck with me/I’m startin’ to hate this fame shit, look what it done to me.” Wins and Losses considers the trappings of celebrity better than any other Meek project. There is never a sense of calm in his raps; he’s always on edge. You get the feeling that recent events have left Meek not knowing who to trust, and his music carries that anxiety. Some songs are rehashes, like “Connect the Dots,” a Rick Ross collaboration that evokes past team-ups like “So Sophisticated.” And “Ball Player” is just one of a handful of tracks that should’ve gotten the axe; redundancy is an issue on the album, as it is on any Meek album (so much so that twice he addresses listeners critical of his endless Rollie raps). He operates in finite space at polar extremes: agony or exuberance. But Meek does challenge himself, and those who suggest he’s merely a shout rapper, on Wins and Losses: “Fall Thru” slathers on the Auto-Tune for a more chic sound; “Open” packs rapid fire flows into a muted sex jam; “Young Black America” turns a heavy sample of JAY-Z’s “Blueprint (Momma Loves Me)” into a chilling 13th audiobook. When tested to come up with his most insightful work and justify his missteps, he delivers compelling alternate truths. Wins and Losses shows the rap game is much harder to score than one might think.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/meek-mill-wins-and-losses/,"Maybach Music Group,Atlantic",2017.0,"Meek Mill is a name that has become synonymous with rap music in the last few years. Originally hailing from Philadelphia, Meek made his mark in the industry with his unique style of rap and his penchant for delivering hard-hitting rhymes. His latest album, ""Wins and Losses,"" is a testament to his growth and evolution as an artist.

The album starts off with the track ""Wins & Losses,"" which sets the tone for the rest of the project. The track is introspective and raw, with Meek reflecting on his journey in the music industry and the highs and lows that have come with it. He touches on his experiences with violence, poverty, and the struggles of trying to make it in a world that can often be unforgiving.

As the album progresses, Meek continues to showcase his lyrical prowess and his ability to craft catchy hooks. The highlight of the album for me is the track ""1942 Flows,"" which features a haunting instrumental and some of Meek's most introspective lyrics to date. He speaks candidly about his experiences with fame, relationships, and the pressures of being a successful artist.

One thing that sets this album apart from Meek's previous work is the production. The beats are more polished and refined, with a more melodic approach than some of his earlier projects. The project also features a diverse range of guest features, including artists like Future, Lil Uzi Vert, and Yo Gotti.

Overall, I would give ""Wins and Losses"" a 7.4 out of 10. While the album doesn't quite reach the heights of Meek's previous work, it's still an impressive project that showcases his growth as an artist.

Autechre,NTS Sessions 1-4,Electronic,8.2,May 15 2018,Andrew Nosnitsky,Contributor,"Karlheinz Stockhausen might’ve imagined the music of Autechre before Autechre did. The German avant-garde composer and all-around insane genius believed that the emergent off-kilter sounds of his time served a specific function: the full-on enlightenment of the human race. His theory, roughly, was that since the dawn of time, man-made music was largely rooted in the natural rhythms of the body (think a four-on-the-floor house beat echoing a heartbeat) but that advances in technology during the late 20th century gave us the means to create new patterns, and that listening to them would actually help us reprogram our biorhythms in kind. “Such complex rhythms can no longer simply be beaten out, tapped with the feet, danced, or even counted,” Stockhausen explained in 1989. “Exposed to such a process, you quickly establish that human beings change. If such new music is produced, that proclaims the development of a new level of human being.” Eventually, he hoped, these newly rewired human brains and bodies might give us the means to travel throughout space and re-establish our relationship with the higher cosmic beings who created us. It’s an idea that seems almost tailor-made for Sean Booth and Rob Brown who, together as Autechre, have been making highly confounding experimental electronic music together for the past 30 years. Not necessarily the part about convening with our alien forefathers, but rather the thought that sound and rhythm are learning experiences unto themselves, that our ears can adapt and evolve to new music and bring the rest of our being and consciousness along for the ride. Certainly the past two decades of their career can support this theory. Ever since fully outgrowing the crunchy ambient techno of their earliest work with 1997’s Chiastic Slide, the Mancunian duo has stayed the course, hammering away at a completely singular but ever-growing formula of slithering, glitching, post-hip-hop, post-human music. NTS Sessions 1-4, initially released over the course of April as a series of weekly broadcasts for the online London station NTS Radio, is the latest and longest of these experiments, clocking in at eight hours total, and is likely completely impenetrable to the uninitiated. This is to say that it’s still very Autechrian. It’s the visceral sound of machines powering down then quickly lurching back into motion. It’s that sense of perpetual rhythmic collapse, the feeling that entire songs are slipping out from under your feet. It’s gorgeous and terrifying and awe-inspiring and incomprehensible and frequently even funky—but only if you let it unfold first. Booth and Brown have so completely mastered their aesthetic that it no longer seems rational to compare it to anything born outside of it. Even when they are proudly flaunting their influences, retracing the daisy chained 808 madness of Mantronix or the nauseating cacophony of early Coil, they claim full ownership. It’s not possible for Autechre to sound like anything except Autechre. And, with each new release, they somehow sound more like Autechre than on the previous one. The sound design is fuller, the programming more intricate, the shock of the new hitting just a bit harder than before. Their recent output can be easily be seen as a running series of mutations on a single body, particularly since they’ve embraced digital music distribution. 2013’s double CD Exai was two hours long and eventually supplemented by a collection of nine hour-long soundboard recordings of live sets from the same era, all variations on the same setlist but not even close to similar in execution. 2016 saw the release of the Elseq 1-5, a five EP digital-only box set of all new material running at four hours total. And now we have a solid eight hours of new material with NTS. These data dumps are welcome indulgences to their cult following, but they’re also instructional: The more time you spend in this world, the more your body learns to adapt to the rhythms. For years now the duo has preferred to perform to completely blacked-out rooms, forcing the audience to fully devote their attention to the sound itself. A solid eight-hour lump of music is roughly the chronological equivalent to this trick. (The original two-hour NTS airing would repeat on an endless continuous loop throughout the week until the next one aired. This provided its own rather disorienting immersive effect—as the playlist sunk into the background of daily internet use it became quite easy to lose track of exactly how many times you had listened to the same songs.) Unlike Elseq, which felt more like five discrete projects presented in one long bundle, NTS really does take shape when digested as a single extended piece. Each session runs seamlessly into the next, with an arc that goes from abrasion to bliss, from the 18-minute relentless plod of “t1a1” to the shimmering ambient closer, “all end,” which runs for nearly an hour. In between, the mechanical rhythms bend, bang, and break. More melodic elements—or at least brutal raw chunks of chords, which is kind of their thing now—claw their way out of the muck unexpectedly, and the human emotions creep up on you. Booth and Brown have always been somewhat cagey about their exact production methods. But their primary tool is Max/MSP, a visual programming language that allows them to create generative algorithms that in effect compose themselves. They’ve talked in the past about the increasing sense that the software is becoming a third member of the group, and the workflow goes something like this: The humans give the computer a set of parameters, then the computer jams endlessly, churning out the requested burps and gurgles, which are passed back to the humans, who edit it all down to a manageable composition. The machine is learning, the composers are learning, and, if all goes as planned, the listeners are learning too. The more time you spend in this world of sound, the closer you get to understanding its true origin—not the sound collages of Stockhausen’s day, but rather the American hip-hop and dance music that Booth and Brown grew up on. When Booth first heard the scratch-heavy electro of Los Angeles electro party rockers Knights of the Turntables in the mid-’80s it was still incomprehensible to him. “I was hearing it the way I heard Stockhausen,” he told Thump in 2015: “If you look at it purely in terms of the sound and science of it, it’s not that far from musique concrète. But there’s this cultural brick wall between the two things.” The NTS Sessions, like so much of Autechre’s output, serve as deeply encrypted history lessons through which to tear down those walls. The duo was fortunate to come of age at a unique moment in musical history, that brief period from the late ’70s to early ’90s, when the sonics themselves were stacked higher than that wall. Advancements in production technology were rapidly outpacing their expected purpose and previously inaccessible music-making devices were suddenly attainable to kids from across all cultural and economic lines. Hip-hop and electro, house and techno, bass and freestyle grew out of this cross-pollination and quickly turned weird. Autechre fully inherited the values of that era and they might be the only artists of our time to still live in them today. So much on NTS Sessions seems to offer a hypothetical alternate timeline to ’80s electronic music: What if it all just kept growing? What if each and every Latin Rascals razor blade micro edit was to re-edit itself violently? What if the stuttering vocals of Miami bass dubs were to develop sub-stutters? If all the acid house squelches grew into roars? If the extended DJ mixes lasted for entire days? And what if all the oh-shit moments that first came with these innovations were still central to the enjoyment of contemporary dance music? It would, presumably, keep evolving until it was no longer even recognizable as such. In 2013, both members of Autechre held an open Q&A on the fan forum Watmm.com, which eventually grew to more than a hundred pages of conversation. It is an essential text in piecing together the Autechre mythology, not only because it’s their longest and most candid interview to date, but also for how well it illustrates the potential chasms between intent and interpretation. When one user asked, “how would a modern [Autechre] dance track sound?” Booth responded with just one unpunctuated sentence fragment: “but we are making dance music.” The divide between the intellectual and the physical has always been false. It’s all just learning.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/autechre-nts-sessions-1-4/,Warp,2018.0,"If you're a fan of experimental electronic music, then Autechre's 'NTS Sessions 1-4' is a must-listen. This album is a unique and fascinating journey that showcases the band's talent for creating rich, complex soundscapes.

Autechre is a British electronic music duo consisting of Sean Booth and Rob Brown. They first rose to popularity in the early 1990s with their album 'Incunabula', which established their unique sound and approach to music production. Over the years, Autechre has become one of the most respected and influential electronic music acts in the world, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with technology and sound.

'NTS Sessions 1-4' was created during live performances on the UK radio station NTS in 2018. The album comprises of four sessions, each consisting of two hours of unrehearsed improvisations. Autechre's approach to music production is to use generative algorithms and modular synthesizers to create their music, resulting in a sound that is unlike anything else in the industry.

The album's opening track, ""t1a1,"" sets the tone for the rest of the album with its atmospheric and otherworldly sounds. It feels like you're being transported to another dimension, one without limits or boundaries. The album continues to build on this feeling, with tracks like ""c16 deep tread"" and ""g 1 e 1"" featuring complex rhythms and intricate melodies that will leave you mesmerized.

One of the things that struck me about this album was how well it flowed from one track to the next. Each session feels like a complete piece, yet they all seamlessly blend into one another. It's a testament to Autechre's talent for not only creating cutting-edge music but also for structuring it into a cohesive listening experience.

As someone who has been a fan of Autechre for years, I can confidently say that 'NTS Sessions 1-4' is one of their most impressive works to date. It's an album that deserves multiple listens, as you'll always discover something new and exciting with each listen. It's a testament to how well Autechre has aged with time and how they continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with electronic music.

Overall, I would give this album an 8.2 out of 10. It's not an easy listen, but it's one that will reward you for your patience and attention. If you're a fan of experimental electronic music or simply looking for something new and exciting, give 'NTS Sessions 1-4' a listen. You won't be disappointed.",Review A,0.8895602946934847,Review A
Fucked Up,Year of the Hare EP,Metal,6.0,June 17 2015,Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,"The thing about Fucked Up is that on their proper albums, their music has never been all that fucked up. At this point, the Toronto band is basically a heavy guitar pop group fronted by the unmistakable hardcore bark of Damian ""Pink Eyes"" Abraham. They're hardcore in spirit and attitude and Wikipedia entry only: 2014's Glass Boys was more digital-age the Who than Minor Threat (and the same goes for 2011’s hour-plus rock opera David Comes to Life, really). As far as living up to their name, it's in their ongoing Zodiac series where they let the freak flag fly. Since 2006's Year of the Dog, they've released an EP (sometimes only ""EP"" in name) once every 12 months or so featuring music inspired by different years of the Chinese calendar. These songs are often long and more experimental. The seventh in the series*, Year of the Hare*, includes a 21-minute title track that was written and recorded in 2013 and a eight-minute B-side recorded in 2014. The cover art was designed by Converge frontman Jake Bannon, who's released Year of the Hare on his Deathwish imprint, but this music isn't especially heavy. Instead, it sounds like the kind of outsider psychedelia that may have popped up on a weirdo imprint like Siltbreeze at some point in the '90s alongside the Strapping Fieldhands, the Dead C, and Harry Pussy. The B-side, ""California Cold"", actually made me think of psyched-out noise-freaks Temple of Bon Matin and Comets on Fire for the first time in awhile. The vocals are hazy and occasionally buried, the guitars reminiscent of a blown-out ""Free Bird"". There are shakers, saxophone, and flute. It's a lusciously murky offering, one that works as an anthem before folding in on itself and breaking apart in interesting ways, and overall is the stronger of the songs here. The title track finds them experimenting with the process of recording itself. ""Year of the Hare"" starts in silence for two minutes before an acoustic guitar strums and the song slowly picks up pace. But throughout these 21 minutes, tape is spliced and edits are intentionally obvious: you get the sound of a cable unplugging (and the connection being reestablished), an empty studio layered over and over, a plaintive piano starting and stopping and warping, music skidding out into a dead-end and then negotiating a new climax. ""Year of the Hare"" feels, at times, very much like their version of a modern-classical experiment: John Cage collaborating with Youth of Today. It's not until about the six-minute mark when they allow themselves to go full bore into the song, and here it becomes an enjoyable Fucked Up anthem. Though, after repeat listens, it remains unclear if you really needed to go through the rest to experience that rush. Abraham and guest vocalist Isla Craig sing—at different times, it's more like Act I and Act II than a duet—about various rabbits, from the popular culture of Alice of Wonderland (""There's only one way to stop a mad watch"") to the kind you find in your backyard. There are ""hare/hair/heir"" puns and references to endless fucking and endless proliferating. These lyrics were written by guitarist and producer Mike Haliechuk, who has said that the song ""focuses on time, and becoming lost in it. The modern way of life, getting stuck in time-sucking gadgets and trends, stress and scheduling."" The song itself is circular, finishing how it began; it feels very much like an endless loop, Abraham howling somewhere in the middle: ""Mad as a march hare, two days late/ They stole all my time and ate all my space/ A thousand rabbits with a million heirs/ It's always tea time in the year of the hare."" The track was accompanied by an unsolvable interactive video that features an office worker being haunted by rabbits on the subway, in his office, and at home. I couldn't get the video to work properly, so just kept refreshing my browser, until I started to wonder if that's actually what they wanted me to do. All of this is admirable enough, even if, at this point, the commentary is a bit obvious. But hey, Fucked Up have continued to stretch and find new ways to carry on, and for a hardcore group that formed in 2001, this is worthy of respect. Doubling down on all of this, the band is about to go out on a Zodiac-themed tour, performing Zodiac songs (some never before performed live) as a nine-piece featuring all the members of the group, Doomsquad. You have to wonder, though, if it isn't time to scale back a little, and to find complexities in a more compact approach. You can add layers and length endlessly, but that often dilutes (Chinese Democracy vs. Appetite for Destruction, if you will). Sometimes a power trio is more than enough. Because while ""Year of the Hare"" offers nice sounds and concepts, it essentially works best as background music. All said, I'm not sure if background music's what I want from a band who, on more than one occasion, literally caused the hair on my neck to stand up.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20607-year-of-the-hare-ep/,Deathwish,2015.0,"If you're a fan of the Toronto hardcore scene, then there's no doubt you've heard of Fucked Up. The band has been a constant presence in the scene for over a decade, and has amassed a loyal following due to their intense live shows and signature sound. Their latest release, Year of the Hare EP, showcases a more experimental approach to their music, while still retaining their hardcore roots.

Before delving into the music itself, it's important to understand Fucked Up's history. Formed in 2001, the band's original lineup consisted of members of various Toronto punk and hardcore bands. They quickly gained a reputation for their chaotic live shows and unapologetic attitude. In 2006, they released their first full-length album, Hidden World, which received critical acclaim and helped to propel the band into the national spotlight.

Over the years, Fucked Up has continued to challenge themselves creatively, incorporating elements of post-punk, garage rock, and even shoegaze into their music. Year of the Hare EP is no exception. The album was recorded in a cottage in rural Ontario, and the band has stated that the isolation played a significant role in the recording process. The result is a more introspective and atmospheric sound, with tracks that are more experimental than their previous releases.

Personal experience wise, while I'm not a die-hard fan of the band, I do appreciate their significance in the Canadian music scene. I found this EP to be a refreshing glimpse of something new and experimental from them, which is always exciting. Tracks like ""Year of the Hare"" and ""California Cold"" showcase a more restrained and thoughtful approach to their music, while still retaining their trademark aggression.

That being said, I do understand why some longtime fans may be disappointed with this release. The EP doesn't have the same immediacy or energy as some of their earlier work, which may turn off some listeners. And while the experimentation is admirable, not all of it works. ""Slackjawed"" in particular feels like a misstep, with its overly long runtime and disjointed structure.

Overall, Year of the Hare EP is a solid addition to Fucked Up's discography. It's not their best work, but it's still a worthy listen for fans of the band or anyone looking for something new and challenging in the hardcore genre. With its introspective mood and experimental sound, it's clear that the band is still evolving and pushing themselves creatively.","- Both reviews discuss the band, Fucked Up, and their latest release, Year of the Hare EP.

Danny Brown,XXX,Rap,8.2,August 26 2011,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"Danny Brown is a Detroit rapper with a strangled yap of a voice that you could politely call ""distinctive."" Depending on the moment, he either resembles a Doberman whose paw has been stepped on or a cross between Jello Biafra and South Park's Terrence & Philip. For a rapper, choosing an abrasive honk like this as your instrument is an audacious move; it all but demands that you come well-equipped with compelling reasons for your listeners to hang on. But Danny Brown is an unusually audacious rapper. He proudly rocks skinny jeans that, to hear him tell it, cost him a G-Unit label deal all by themselves, and he has lately settled on the kind of wildly asymmetrical haircut that can invite savage beatings in certain areas. He belongs, in other words, to a proud lineage of mangy underground-rap weirdos. There are many rappers vying to claim this spot, but none of them is as talented or as three-dimensional as Brown, and his latest mixtape, XXX, finds him transforming his quirks and jagged edges into a compelling and immersive universe. That universe is haunted by drugs, both sold and consumed. XXX's grubby production, laced with trashy electro, evokes a heart-pounding clamminess that will feel instantly familiar to anyone who's weathered a spiky high on cheap stimulants. Brown's voice is uniquely suited to conveying wild-eyed, loose-cannon insanity, and the rising note of panic in it makes every mention of snorting crushed Adderall hurt. To hear him tell it, he is a Hoover for illegal substances; on ""Die Like a Rock Star"", he catalogs the various undignified ends he expects to meet, invoking Keith Moon, Jimi Hendrix, and others and leering, ""Experimented so much it's a miracle I'm livin'."" His penchant for depravity might remind listeners, at least initially, of Odd Future. But Brown's depravity, unlike OF's, comes burdened with real-life stakes; at age 30 (the mixtape's title indicates Brown's age besides suggesting sex and drugs), Brown has lived through some genuinely awful-sounding shit. On ""Scrap or Die"", he flips the chorus of Jeezy's ""Trap or Die"" so that it becomes about stripping houses for scrap metal to sell to factories. He takes a perverse joy in grabbing your neck and shoving your face in some vividly unpleasant places: ""I done served fiends on they menstrual/ Ain't even had pads, stuff they panties with tissue!"" he yelps on ""Monopoly"". His shock rhymes on XXX are like horrorcore stripped of cartoon fantasy, and they carry the moral weight of experience. On ""Pac Blood"", he calls his lyrics ""shit so personal my mom can't listen to,"" and you believe him. If XXX was nothing but debauchery and desperation, it would quickly devolve into an endless slog. Thankfully, Brown is also hilariously funny, an endlessly inventive rapper driven to cook up outrageous variations on standard rap boasts. At one point, he claims to be getting as much pussy as Teen Wolf-era Michael J. Fox; at another, he brags he can ""get pussy like loofahs."" On ""Adderall Admiral"", he tells a rapper he is ""softer than Flanders' son."" In a recent interview with writer Andrew Nosnitsky of Cocaine Blunts, he revealed himself as an omnivorous rap nerd, the kind of guy who went through heavy No Limit and Def Jux phases, and his palpable joy in his craft is infectious. ""Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head,"" he raps on the title track, sounding astonished and grateful. His gleeful love of words not only elevates some pretty heavy subject matter; it also helps distinguish XXX as one of the most compelling indie rap releases in an already strong year.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15753-xxx/,Fool's Gold,2011.0,"It's hard to imagine a world without Danny Brown. The Detroit rapper who made his mark with his unique flow, manic energy, and abstract lyrics that paint the picture of the grit and grime of urban living is back in action with his latest album, XXX.

The album is a masterful showcase of Danny Brown's lyrical prowess and his knack for blending disparate elements into a cohesive whole. From the screeching synths of ""Die Like a Rockstar"" to the ethereal vocals of ""DNA,"" Danny Brown shows that he is not afraid to push boundaries and challenge himself as an artist.

XXX is a deeply personal album for Danny Brown. He has spoken publicly about his struggles with addiction and depression, and both themes are present throughout the album. In ""Adderall Admiral,"" Danny Brown raps about his reliance on the prescription drug Adderall, while on ""Fields,"" he reflects on his difficult upbringing and the impact it has had on his life.

The album is also a love letter to Detroit. Danny Brown is fiercely proud of his hometown, and that pride is evident on tracks like ""30"" and ""Detroit 187."" He raps about the struggles and triumphs of living in a city that has faced numerous challenges over the years, and his love for the city shines through.

In terms of musicality, XXX is a tour de force. The production is top-notch, with beats that range from menacing to ethereal. Danny Brown's flow is as sharp as ever, and he effortlessly switches between different styles and cadences. The album also features some impressive guest appearances, including Kendrick Lamar on ""Really Doe"" and Ab-Soul on ""Way Up Here.""

Ultimately, XXX is a triumph for Danny Brown. It showcases his growth as an artist while staying true to the unique sound that made him famous in the first place. It's a deeply personal and intensely relatable album that offers a window into the soul of one of the most talented rappers of our time.

For me, personally, XXX is one of my favorite albums of all time. As someone who grew up in an urban environment, the themes and stories that Danny Brown raps about hit close to home. The album is one that I can listen to from start to finish and never get tired of. It's intense, thought-provoking, and, above all, authentic. If you're a fan of rap or just love great music in general, then XXX is an album that you absolutely cannot miss.","1. Both reviews are detailed and provide insight into the artist and their album.

The Futureheads,News & Tributes,"Electronic,Rock",7.7,May 16 2006,Sam Ubl,,"News & Tributes is a satisfying record, nooked and crannied with asymmetry and surprise detours, and marred by only one truly shitty song. But it's also less exuberant, less fun, less love-me-or-else desperate than the band's self-titled debut. Instead, it's all lonely ringing guitar chords, light-jog tempos, pensive vocals alternately breathed and belted-- in short, it's not the promo I thought I was copping, not the shit-kicking sequel, Back to the Futureheads Part II. The Sunderland-based band's self-titled debut met, and embraced, a paradox: The album possessed equal quantities subtlety and exuberance. Those qualities tend to be mutually restraining but the Futureheads indulged both and the result was 2004's most nuanced and giddiest rock record. Kicking off with the triumphant ""Yes/No"", News & Tributes again rides in booming and victorious, with a thrilling call-and-response vocal hook and a brawny drum beat that's more ""Abel"" than ""A to B"". But it's a bit of a red herring: Ben Hillier (Depeche Mode, Doves, Blur) produced the album, and he jettisons the band's blood-pumping compactness in favor of a larger, less focused sound. The attitude and songwriting follow suit, stretching out in the bigger, lonelier sonic space. ""Thursday"" couches its deep blue vocal (cf. Bobby Vinton) in flickering eighth-note pulses; it's probably the most static (and soggiest) thing they've written. ""Fallout"" politely declines syncopation, opting instead for chord punches and a wordless chorus over a dogged two-beat. Just the guitar sound, muffled and overdriven and perhaps a bit sun-damaged, is so utterly alien to this band. Unlike its predecessor, which was the work of dizzy young band so anxious to assert a unique own voice it kept on pounding home the same ideas, News & Tributes scoops from every flavor in the freezer. Its newfangled variety runs most errant on ""Return of the Berserker"", which thrashes for thrash's sake, and should only be performed live and in front of drunk people. Other experiments fare better: ""Back to the Sea"" lays into a low-slung groove centered on one of those deep-ass reverby snares Fugazi loved, while ""Burnt"" trots out a wily acoustic guitar. Not everything has gone inverted-- and News & Tributes is still catchy as sin. Stripped down, slower, and less note-happy, the album uses repetition to inculcate. ""Skip to the End"" does most with the least, building tension with sporadic chords and a taut, jangly guitar lick, releasing it with a four-part harmony. Dudes haven't exactly forgotten how to sing overnight. ""Worry About It Later"" reups ""Hounds of Love""'s barreling drums, chest-puffed vocals, and optimistic hugeness. Obviously, it's the best song here. Some will tell you the kernel idea, the knee-jerk impulse, the gut rumble that's our cue to get moving, is always the brightest moment. So if News & Tributes comes up short of the band's last record it's ultimately because it lacks the urgency of a one-shot glory bid. But it's impossible to play every song like it's your last when you plan to stick around a while, when you've earned something to lose. ",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3317-news-tributes/,"Vagrant,679",2006.0,"The Futureheads: News & Tributes

As soon as I pressed play on this record, it was clear that The Futureheads were mining some pretty slick territory. Combining rock and electronic styles, the Sunderland quartet delivers a platter of endlessly danceable grooves on this release.

For those unfamiliar with The Futureheads, they formed in the early 2000s and rapidly gained a cult following thanks to their energetic live sets and unique sound. It was their catchy, instantly memorable vocals and catchy guitar hooks that helped them stand out from the crowd, but they were never content to rest on their laurels. Instead, they pushed forward with every release, making some tough artistic choices along the way.

On News & Tributes, The Futureheads leave behind some of their earlier punk leanings in favor of a more sophisticated sound, incorporating a broader range of musical instruments and textures. The result is an album that's both musically progressive and lyrically mature, bringing together elements of punk, rock, and electronic – sometimes all in the same song.

From start to finish, it's hard to pick a favorite track. ""The Return of the Berserker"" crackles with energy, ""The Beginning of the Twist"" balances danceability and biting lyrics, and ""Burnt"" evokes feelings and images of sorrow and longing. But what's really remarkable is the record's consistency - every track offers something special.

But, there are moments when the band takes a step too far, indulging in stylistic choices that don't quite land. ""Favours for Favours"" and ""Worry About it Later"" make things feel a bit frenzied, but that's just one small misstep in an otherwise stellar album.

All in all, The Futureheads' News & Tributes is a well-crafted and engaging album from one of the most innovative, yet under-appreciated groups out there. Their blending of rock and electronic elements is seamless, and the attention to detail in every aspect of the recording process is impressive. If you're looking for a new album to add to your playlist, this one is certainly worth a look.","1.

Noah Georgeson,Find Shelter,Folk/Country,6.8,January 30 2007,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"The term ""freak-folk""-- coined by this very website-- has, perhaps not surprisingly, become almost universally disliked, particularly by those artists to whom it has been applied. Yet no matter what description one uses to help classify the various forms of contemporary avant-folk, there's little question that the Bay Area's Noah Georgeson should be considered one of the genre's chief architects. In the past few years, Georgeson has produced such notable works as Joanna Newsom's The Milk-Eyed Mender and Vetiver's To Find Me Gone, played alongside Devendra Banhart and recorded his Cripple Crow album, and produced Bert Jansch's recent Drag City release The Black Swan. In the wake of all this activity now appears Georgeson's solo debut Find Shelter, a strange and unassuming album whose lush, brooding surfaces bear surprisingly little comparison to his previous production work. As a young musician and composer, Georgeson counted his Nevada City neighbor Terry Riley as one of his earliest listeners, and with Riley's recommendation he entered the Master's program at Mills College. While pursuing his degree he studied under such artists as Pauline Oliveros, Alvin Curran, and Fred Frith. Georgeson wrote, arranged and recorded the songs that would eventually take shape on Find Shelter between 1999 and 2003, penning most of it while living with Newsom as she was writing the bulk of Milk-Eyed Mender. Predictably, given this background, Find Shelter sounds simply marvelous from a production standpoint, its gentle surges of mellotron and acoustic guitar perfectly balanced with Georgeson's elegant orchestrations. With its cinematic atmospheres and idiosyncratic song structures, the album shares little or nothing in common with the reverent folk-rock formalism of Banhart or Jansch. Instead, Find Shelter makes its company alongside the work of other in-studio eccentrics like producer Jack Nitzsche or Lee Hazlewood. The resemblance to Hazlewood is especially acute in regards to Georgeson's quavering Western vocal style, the limitations of which can also vaguely bring to mind a hungover Beck. Due in part to Georgeson's narrow vocal range, there are points on Find Shelter when he sounds to be almost audibly withdrawing from the spotlight, as on the gracefully constructed ""Glorious Glory"" where he appears eager to camouflage his vocal beneath as many verdant layers of strings and woodwinds as possible. Likewise, such tracks as ""Wooden Empire"" obscure his skillful flamenco guitar lines with blanketed drones, leaving many of these songs with an indistinct line of vision, and many of his stately melodies stranded just tantalizingly out of reach. This overriding sense of ambiguity is further heightened by Georgeson's largely inscrutable lyrics. ""Sharpen two needles/ That puncture jungles/ Grow cathedrals,"" he sings on ""Priests of Cholera"" as the music swells with hidden drama and majesty, his voice buried just far enough in the mix to frustrate further attempts to apprehend his narrative intent. Although Find Shelter contains several passages of undeniable chamber-pop beauty--most notably (and perhaps not coincidentally) on brief instrumental tracks like the opening ""Tied to the Mountains"" or ""Shawm Overture""-- at album's end Georgeson himself remains an elusive figure, sounding perfectly content to remain behind-the-scenes even on his own record. Particularly when taken in contrast with such forceful and distinctive musical personalities as Banhart and Newsom, one has to wonder if Georgeson might simply be better served working more closely with another musical foil, perhaps someone able to add either a little more folk or a lot more freak.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9813-find-shelter/,Plain,2006.0,"Noah Georgeson's latest album, ""Find Shelter"" is a delightful mixture of Folk and Country music, and it's a refreshing piece of art that leaves the listener fulfilled in every possible way. With a rating of 6.8 out of 10, it may not be perfect, but it's definitely worth your attention.

Georgeson is a skilled musician and producer, who has worked with several notable artists, including Joanna Newsom and Devendra Banhart. He's a multi-talented artist who puts a lot of effort into his work. ""Find Shelter"" is another grand addition to his impressive discography.

The album has an emotional depth that is hard to scrutinize. It flows like a river, carrying the listener along with it. It's undoubtedly his most cohesive and well-structured release to date. Every track on the album stands out in its own way, which makes it more challenging to pick any favorites. The only downside of the album is that it feels like it's missing something when it ends. You may not find anything that you outright dislike, but you may also not find enough to love either. 

The title track, ""Find Shelter,"" is a perfect example of Georgeson's ability to blend together different styles of music. The song has an impeccable balance between country and folk styles. The lyrics are poignant and heart-wrenching, and the incandescent instrumentation complements the overall ambiance excellently. It is, without a doubt, one of the high points of the album.

Another favorite is ""Discreet Love."" The song has a melancholic melody that perfectly captures the nuanced themes of love and loss. The instrumentals are gentle and uplifting, making it easy to get lost in its beauty.

Georgeson has undoubtedly poured himself into this album, and it shows. He's reinvented his style, blending elements from various sub-genres of country and folk to create a sound unique to himself. ""Find Shelter"" may not be groundbreaking, but it's a fantastic album that is worth listening to.

In conclusion, the album is a highly recommended collection of songs. Noah Georgeson's ""Find Shelter"" is a well-crafted piece of music that will satisfy any Country or Folk lover. It's a tribute to his proficiency as a musician and producer. The album invites the listener to immerse themselves into his world and experience his journey.

Wolf Eyes,Undertow,Experimental,7.3,March 31 2017,Zoe Camp,Contributor,"“Time is what keeps everything from happening at once.” So declared sci-fi grand poo-bah Ray Cummings in his 1921 short story “The Time Professor,” 76 years before the inception of Wolf Eyes, his theorem’s greatest challengers in music. The clock has long since become subservient to the Detroit trio, at least aesthetically. However prominent a role it may appear to play—monumental song lengths, alternating moments of eerie calm and explosive fury that seem to stretch on for eternity—time’s ultimately rendered obsolete under Wolf Eyes’ crushing gravity. The ever-shifting darkness is all that remains, devoid of any logical metric for measuring the band’s 20-year reign of terror—which, naturally, means everything’s going according to plan. Or is it? Just over a minute into Wolf Eyes’ new album Undertow, vocalist Nate Young takes the mic for a groggy dispatch from his personal hell, deep beneath the rubble of Motor City. “I spent too much time outside, but it never seemed the same,” he moans on the titular opener, later conceding: “I spent too much time on an answer/Wanting to see if I’d ever grow old.” Permanence, it seems, has become a bit of a chore for him and his pals–and how couldn’t it, considering our ironclad perception of the group as monstrous, restless shape-shifters? Still, Wolf Eyes aren’t about to soften, or worse, surrender to Father Time. With this record, they’re just giving him a little room to breathe. It’s a small gesture that goes a long way. Like the band’s last long player, 2015’s I Am a Problem: Mind in Pieces, *Undertow *finds Wolf Eyes a bit tamer than usual, shoehorning their concrète-tinged racket to more conventional melodic paradigms. They’ve mostly done away with the bluesy flirtations this time around, instead applying a wrecking ball to the spacious, lush frameworks of world music, ambient, and even reggae. “Texas” plays out like a new age nightmare, as John Olson’s saxophone stabs into the smoke-shrouded void with skronk after agonizing skronk, electrifying otherwise sedate woodwinds into instruments of war. “Empty Island,” on the other hand, is Wolf Eyes’ dip into dub, presided over by an acrid, guillotine-like *riddim *(which is also present on the title track, albeit to a slightly lesser extent) and Jim Baljo’s hazy noodling. Wolf Eyes save their biggest, weirdest statement on Undertow for last with “Thirteen,” a primal epic whose nearly 14-minute runtime comprises more than half of this five-track project. The monolith derives its frisson–or rather, its malaise–from a long, tortuous tug-of-war between Baljo’s guitars and Olsen’s synths, which fall upon the ears with all the grace of a Biblical swarm of cicadas. Young’s protracted moans, meanwhile, accumulate and linger, eventually bleeding into the surrounding soundscape. By the 10-minute mark, the acid trip’s reached its hemorrhaging apex and the trio amble off into the murk, hands clutching tambourines and maracas, wild hearts satiated by maniacally-enabled catharsis.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23045-wolf-eyes-undertow/,Lower Floor,2017.0,"If listening to music is like going on a journey, then the experimental genre is like taking a detour down a winding and unpredictable dirt road. And that's exactly what Wolf Eyes' album ""Undertow"" feels like - a wild and raw journey into the depths of the unknown.

Before even diving into the album, it's worth taking a moment to appreciate the band's history. Hailing from Michigan, Wolf Eyes formed in the late 90s and quickly became pioneers of the experimental noise scene. They gained a reputation for their intense and unpredictable live shows, complete with blaring feedback and chaotic percussion. ""Undertow,"" released in 2002, is a testament to the power and creativity of the band's early days.

But what about the album itself? From the first track, ""Rationed Rot,"" it's clear that ""Undertow"" is not for the faint of heart. The track opens with shrieking feedback and distorted drums, setting the tone for the rest of the album. But to dismiss this album as just noise would be a disservice to the creativity and artistry behind it.

Songs like ""Stabbed in the Face"" and ""Desert of Glue"" showcase the band's ability to create a sense of tension and release, with sudden bursts of rhythm and melody breaking through the chaos. And even in the more sparse and haunting tracks like ""Broken Order"" and ""Burned Mind,"" there's an undeniable sense of emotion and depth lurking beneath the surface.

For me, ""Undertow"" is an album that I can't help but feel deeply connected to. Despite the abrasive and challenging nature of the sound, there's something strangely cathartic about listening to it. Maybe it's the raw emotion that's packed into every track, or the sense of letting go that comes with letting yourself get lost in the noise. Whatever it is, ""Undertow"" is an album that I keep coming back to, again and again.

Overall, I'd give ""Undertow"" a solid rating of 7.3 out of 10. It's not an album for everyone, but for those willing to take the detour down the dirt road of experimental music, it's a journey worth taking.","1.

The Cinematic Orchestra,In Motion #1,Electronic,6.0,June 25 2012,Nate Patrin,Contributor,"Blame it on guilt by association, but Jason Swinscoe and the Cinematic Orchestra never entirely deserved the cocktail-lounge reputation that was dumped on their heads when the trip-hop hangover set in. It's sit-down music by any measure, but casual wine-and-cheese conversation doesn't suit it quite like sitting in a darkened room to the accompaniment of some motion-picture visuals-- an experience that amplifies the music's actual purpose instead of letting it aimlessly float around in the background. This has long been the relationship between music paired with film-- Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack for Vertigo and Jerry Goldsmith's Alien weren't made to accompany early-morning jogs, and they'll make your dinner party more unnerving than is necessary, but when bodies are falling and monsters are stalking they sound absolutely peerless. Not every score can be a Shaft-style pop-music crossover that works just as well outside the theater. Man With a Movie Camera, which was made to score the 1929 Dziga Vertov documentary of the same name, has stood for the better part of a decade as the Cinematic Orchestra's most prominent effort to reconcile that visual-underscore orchestration, with their blend of string-section jazz informed by another corner of cinema-- think Taxi Driver and Chinatown, to re-invoke Herrmann and Goldsmith. But the acid-jazz influence that characterized their other high-profile moments, whether stark and spare (""To Build a Home"") or sweepingly lavish (""All That You Give""), takes a backseat to classical compositions on In Motion #1. And while it's the most cinematic and orchestral record with their name on it, it's also not entirely a Cinematic Orchestra album, either-- note the little fine-print ""presents"" on the cover-- as they've outsourced a few ideas to composers who are more deeply rooted in chamber music and modern classical. The seven songs on In Motion #1 were commissioned as alternate scores to seven short avant-garde films, and without those inspirations unspooling in front of the listener, there's a strange incompleteness to most of them. Of the three Cinematic Orchestra tracks, only ""Necrology"" feels like something that can stand on its own two feet; glassy piano melodies burble warmly over a tricky-signature drum barrage, and the theme rides out through subtle shifts that keep the dynamic from going flat. The other two cuts run long and fall short. The 20-plus-minute ""Entr'acte"" aims for a jarring contrast between bucolic pleasantness and waves of impending doom, but it evokes nothing more stirring than a vaguely artsy commercial for wireless gadgets or German performance sedans, and its build into a flimsily ""epic"" rock-drum coda is too little and too late to feel like the culmination of anything. The swooning uplift of ""Manhatta"" sounds like it could be from any blandly inspirational period piece about a never-say-die racehorse or an ambitious industrialist with a crazy dream. The other contributors run through their own variations, all slow-paced and subtle and pushing nine minutes or more. Austin Peralta's dreamlike piano-and-strings ""Lapis"" is the most immediately beautiful of the pieces; Grey Reverend's acoustic guitar-driven ""Regen"" has some fine Astral Weeks interplay with the string section here and there; and the two tracks by Tom Chant and Dorian Concept, ""Outer Space"" and ""Dream Work"", lace raw-nerve suspenseful movements with piercing saxophone solos that jump out like suddenly scattering birds. Yet there's still something naggingly missing in these pieces, as if you're only catching one side of a potentially fascinating conversation. But all the films those songs score are readily available on YouTube-- so hit the mute button on the video, cue up the corresponding piece on In Motion #1, and things all fall into place. ""Outer Space"" and ""Dream Work"" are both based around two films by Peter Tscherkassky that turn clips of the 1982 horror b-movie The Entity into gristle-speckled, high-contrast black-and-white studies in decay, and the juxtapositions with the seizure-warning footage really draw out the menace in Chant and Concept's work. James Whitney's Lapis and its meditative, hypnotic, abstract psychedelic animation was originally soundtracked by 66-chic sitars, but Peralta's piece is a good way to draw out the film's more nuanced movements-- and the music's trippier elements. The continuous downward crowd-shot pan of Standish Lawder's Necrology finds the ideal accompaniment in the similar slow-motion descent of the Cinematic Orchestra's composition, ""Manhatta"" feels a lot less treacly and a lot more stirring when set to Paul Strand's silent document of New York City in 1921, and the rainfall study of Joris Ivens' Regen is a stirring inspiration for Grey Reverend's light-fingered guitar. The only piece that stumbles in juxtaposition with its inspiration is ""Entr'acte"", which tries to replace Erik Satie's lively, slyly comedic score to René Clair's Dadaist ballet intermission short with music too conventionally dramatic and stuffily dignified to fit the surrealist slapstick. But you could always save that one for dinner parties-- the rest do well being listened to with your eyes.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16845-in-motion-1/,Beat Records,2012.0,"Are you in the mood for something with a bit of class and sophistication, yet still infused with some electronic beats? Then look no further than The Cinematic Orchestra's ""In Motion #1"".

This album is a blend of instrumental and electronic sounds, with a jazzy feel to it that's hard not to appreciate. It's clear that this band has been around for a while, with a distinct sound that they've perfected over time. In fact, The Cinematic Orchestra has been around since the late 1990s, creating soulful and emotive music that captures the imagination.

The album was created as part of a collaboration between The Cinematic Orchestra and a number of filmmakers, where the band composed music to accompany specific visual experiences. The result is a collection of tracks that are not only powerful when listened to alone, but when combined with the visual elements create a truly immersive media experience.

One standout track on this album is ""Theme de Yoyo"", which samples French singer-songwriter Georges Moustaki's 1970 track of the same name. The combination of the sampled vocals with the ambient, jazzy sounds of The Cinematic Orchestra results in a track that will get stuck in your head for days. Another track, ""Manhatta"", features a spoken word performance from legendary poet and musician Roots Manuva, adding a layer of depth and complexity to an already rich track.

But perhaps the greatest strength of ""In Motion #1"" is its ability to connect with the listener on a personal level. When I listened to this album, I was immediately transported into a dream-like state where anything was possible. The music is both deeply relaxing and wildly imaginative, and I found myself lost in each track as if it were its own microcosm.

Overall, if you're looking for something a bit different, yet still accessible, ""In Motion #1"" is definitely worth checking out. It may not be the most groundbreaking album out there, but there's no denying the skill and finesse that The Cinematic Orchestra displays in every track. With a rating of 6.0 out of 10, this album is definitely worth your time.","1.

Violent Femmes,Violent Femmes,Rock,9.1,May 21 2017,Steven Hyden,Contributor,"Billie Jo Campbell was discovered at age 3 while walking down a street in Los Angeles with her mother. A photographer approached, told the mother that Billie Jo was adorable, and asked if she wouldn’t mind her daughter appearing in a photo shoot at a house in Laurel Canyon. The mother—“a free spirit,” Billie Jo explained—promptly set up an appointment. They later learned that the shoot was for the cover of an album by an obscure acoustic-punk trio from Milwaukee about to release their debut. In the photo, barefoot Billie Jo wears a cute white dress and strains to peer inside a darkened house through a window. She had no idea that this was an apt metaphor for the band’s songs, which capture that precise moment when childhood innocence is corrupted by the obsessions of the adult world—sex, violence, perverted religiosity, and omnipresent death. Years later, when Billie Jo was a teenager in the ’90s, she realized that the album was pretty momentous. “This was my bragging point,” she recalled in 2007. “I’d be at parties, and if the girls in the dorm knew you were trying to meet cute boys, they’d tell them I am on the cover.” What’s amazing about this story isn’t just that Billie Jo Campbell was still recognized, well into her college years, as the kid on the cover of the Violent Femmes’ self-titled 1983 LP. It’s that people knew what the cover even looked like. “I think the majority of people found out about our music because somebody had made a tape and played it at a party. I’ve heard that so many times,” said Violent Femmes’ singer-songwriter Gordon Gano in a 2016 interview, still cherubic even in his early 50s. “A few years ago, I had somebody that was a big fan say, ‘What does your album cover look like? I’ve never seen it because it’s always been on a tape that somebody made.’” Violent Femmes are perhaps the greatest mixtape band of its era—they were to Maxell what Drake now is to Spotify playlists. Long after the Femmes’ initial wave of underground fame came and went in the mid-’80s*, *choice cuts from their first album kept popping up on countless tapes dispensed throughout teenage suburbia. For those that encountered the Femmes in this manner, the band’s songs were akin to outsider art—found musical data that offered bracingly unfiltered takes on lust and alienation and the yearning to belong, written on an acoustic guitar by a misfit kid who sang in an untrained pubescent whine. Mixtapes gave Violent Femmes renewed life divorced from the context of their own up-and-down career, infusing songs from their first and most successful record with the adolescent angst of each subsequent generation of middle-schoolers in search of a spokesman. This is the art of the mixtape, finding songs that will expose your innermost self to whoever is receiving the tape. And Violent Femmes songs were catchy and simple enough to work especially well as plainspoken musical messages. If you wanted a killer kick-off for your “I’m an Edgy Outsider and Want to Be Appreciated As Such” mix—one of the most popular mixtape genres—a common choice was “Blister in the Sun,” in which Gano snakes allusions to heroin and premature ejaculation behind Brian Ritchie’s relentlessly busy bass line, like a shoplifter stuffing cigarettes down the front of his jeans. And the perfect closer for that tape would inevitably be “Add It Up,” a relentless rant that argues against involuntary celibacy on the grounds that it can make you homicidal. (“Gone Daddy Gone” also worked in this slot, particularly if the tape had an “all marimbas” theme.) The other most popular mixtape genre was “I’m Into You and This Is My Way of Showing It,” and Violent Femmes delivered there as well. Gano wrote the most romantic song on *Violent Femmes, *“Good Feeling,” when he was just 15. An affectingly pure expression of fairy-tale love, “Good Feeling” is a rare moment of unfettered tenderness on an otherwise brash record, revealing the nice young man behind the bravado who was raised by a Baptist minister and a theater actress. Gano actually wrote a collection of gospel songs around the same time as Violent Femmes, but Ritchie, an atheist, refused to record them. He and excitable stand-up drummer Victor DeLorenzo—who was the oldest member by several years—were more comfortable with the nervy “Please Do Not Go,” in which Gano pledges to “patiently pray, pray, pray, pray, pray” for sex rather than salvation. Gano and Ritchie later admitted that the members of Violent Femmes had virtually nothing in common except for music. But in the beginning, at least, that was enough to bond them together, because nobody else in their hometown of Milwaukee, Wis. took Violent Femmes seriously. The affectations that later endeared them to fans —the ramshackle instrumentation, the spitefully witty lyrics, Gano’s habit of wearing a bathrobe in public—stigmatized the Femmes in the Milwaukee club scene. They were forced to busk in the street with acoustic instruments because nobody would book them. According to legend, Violent Femmes were “discovered” in 1981 by James Honeyman-Scott of the Pretenders, who invited them to open for his band during a performance at Milwaukee’s Oriental Theatre after seeing them busk outside the venue. Gano had just graduated from high school, and it was rare of the Femmes to perform indoors on an actual stage. This story became an oft-repeated talking point in press releases after the Femmes became semi-famous in the American indie underground. But as the band members themselves were quick to point out, Violent Femmes were hardly set up for a professional career after that minor acknowledgment. As always, they were left to fend for themselves, eventually borrowing $10,000 from DeLorenzo’s father to fund recording sessions at a studio in Lake Geneva, about 50 miles southwest of Milwaukee. Producer Mark Van Hecke later described the studio as being “in a state of collapse. You’d go into the studio and there would be this equipment, and the next day you go in there’s a piece missing because it got repossessed.” Van Hecke’s intention was to give Violent Femmes a classic Sun Sessions sound, though this naturalistic approach required lots of takes, as the band tended to move around a lot while playing. For Van Hecke, working with the Femmes was an act of faith—he had previously tried to shop a three-song demo to a few dozen record labels in New York and Los Angeles, and all of them said no. “A lot of people thought I was nuts and this was shit. I knew it wasn’t,” he said later. Nevertheless, Violent Femmes were oddly confident in themselves. “When we made the first album, we thought it was destined to be considered a masterpiece,” Ritchie claimed in 2015. The first prominent person to agree that Violent Femmes were destined for greatness was *New York Times *music critic Robert Palmer, whose rave review of two performances opening for Richard Hell at the Bottom Line and CBGB in 1982 was instrumental in getting the Femmes a deal with Slash Records. Palmer, a blues scholar who had just published the definitive history *Deep Blues *the previous year, compared Gano to his most obvious antecedents, Lou Reed and Jonathan Richman. But Palmer also heard a new strain of Americana in Violent Femmes’ revved-up, snotty confessionals, likening songs to “the discursive, rambling structures of folk-era Dylan.” In a subsequent review of Violent Femmes’ second album, 1984’s overtly spiritual *Hallowed Ground, *Palmer detected “a subterranean mother lode of apocalyptic religion, murder, and madness that has lurked just under the surface of hillbilly music and blues since the 19th century” in the Femmes’ knowingly primitive music. Perhaps Palmer was also thinking of *Violent Femmes’ *“Gone Daddy Gone,” which lifts a verse from Willie Dixon’s “I Just Want To Make Love To You,” or the teenage murder ballad “To The Kill,” in which Gano fantasizes about vengefully hunting down his ex in Chicago, like so many Delta musicians decades earlier. Flash forward to the ’90s, and Palmer’s conflation of Gano’s songs with the timeless quality of the blues felt truer than ever, even as Violent Femmes also seemed more contemporary than ever. In the ’80s, Violent Femmes were strictly an underground phenomenon; a slow but steady seller, the self-titled debut finally went platinum in February of 1991, though it didn’t actually crack the Billboard 200 chart until later that year. By then, Violent Femmes had achieved a measure of mainstream recognition thanks to the alt-rock explosion. They became a fixture of nostalgic movie soundtracks—Ethan Hawke sang “Add It Up” to needle Winona Ryder in *Reality Bites, *and Minnie Driver blasted “Blister In The Sun” on the hip underground radio show that John Cusack obsesses over in *Grosse Pointe Blank. Violent Femmes even appeared in an episode of “Sabrina The Teenage Witch”—*mean girl Libby casts a spell on Gano, making him serenade her with “Please Do Not Go” while Sabrina and her aunts do an awkward skank. Violent Femmes' influence was now discernible in the legion of underground rockers who had codified Gano's quirky vocal style into what is now commonly recognized as the ""indie guy"" voice. In years to come, Gano’s vocals—recently described by author J.K. Rowling as sounding “like a bee in a plastic cup”—would echo in Stephen Malkmus, Jeff Mangum, Colin Meloy, Alec Ounsworth of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, and countless less heralded reedy young men. Violent Femmes remain a band out of time. They are rarely mentioned with the “canon” bands of ’80s American post-punk—lacking the sales and accolades of R.E.M., the Replacements, and the Pixies, the Femmes don’t signify an era so much as a time of life. Violent Femmes is children’s music for teenagers—uber-elementary sing-alongs that have their time and place, and then are set aside as facile once they’re outgrown. But *Violent Femmes *deserves better. If the blues survived because of the oral tradition of passing down songs from one singer to another, Violent Femmes endured because the tunes were shared via word of mouth at dorm parties and high school keggers. (Even the girl on the cover learned about Violent Femmes that way.) And don’t discount those precious mixtapes, a primitive form of social media that worked exponentially slower than the internet but were ultimately no less effective at creating a lasting legacy. For young people growing up in the internet age, Violent Femmes is part of a shared language. In 2013, after a period of estrangement marked by lawsuits and public in-fighting, Violent Femmes were persuaded to reunite for a performance at Coachella. “As soon as we started out the set with ‘Blister in the Sun,’ when that riff hit, it was like a swarm of insects coming towards our stage. They all started running from the other stages,” Ritchie recalled. All these years later, whenever teenagers listen to songs from *Violent Femmes, *they also hear themselves.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23130-violent-femmes/,Slash,1983.0,"Let's talk about the eponymous debut album of the Violent Femmes, shall we? It's a classic for a reason, and I for one can name it as one of the most significant records to have come out of the '80s underground music scene. This album is a perfect gem of punk folk rock rage that manages to stay timeless and fresh even after all these years.

Let's start with a little bit of historical context; formed in the early '80s, the Violent Femmes are a three-piece band hailing from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Their sound is unique and hard to pin down, with elements of folk, punk, and rockabilly all intermingling in a cacophonous yet harmonious blend. Their cult classic debut album was recorded in just two days on a shoestring budget, and it shows in the raw, visceral energy that emanates from every single track.

What really stands out about this album is the authenticity and fearlessness of frontman Gordon Gano. His voice quavers with adolescent angst as he sings about teenage rebellion, insecurity, and lust. From the iconic opening chords of ""Blister In The Sun,"" to the mournful strains of ""Good Feeling,"" each track is a masterclass in punk intensity and emotional honesty.

But it's not just the lyrics that make this album great. The musicianship on display is equally impressive. The stripped-down instrumentation, consisting of just a guitar, bass, and snare drum, lends the music a minimalist, yet totally engrossing quality. Every strummed chord, thumping bassline, and snare hit adds an urgency and intensity that grabs you by the collar and never lets go.

Personal experience-wise, I can still remember the first time I heard this album. I was in my early twenties, feeling disillusioned with the world and unsure of my place in it. But when I heard Gordon Gano's raw, unfiltered voice cutting through the murky haze of apathy, a switch flipped in my head. Suddenly, I was seeing the world with fresh eyes, and I had the Violent Femmes to thank for that.

All in all, ""Violent Femmes"" is a masterful album that transcends genre and time. It's one of those rare records that manages to capture a certain moment in time, and yet resonates just as powerfully now as it did when it was first released. If you haven't already, I urge you to give this album a listen. You won't regret it.","1.

A Silver Mt. Zion,He Has Left Us Alone but Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corners of Our Rooms,,9.0,March 31 2000,Matt LeMay,Contributor,"Is it me, or was Y2K a total bust? Call me crazy, but I was genuinely hoping that something interesting would happen. To tell you the truth, I didn't care if the light bulb in my living room blew or a giant animated foot descended from heaven and crushed Times Square-- I just wanted something, anything, to happen. Blame it on too much Godspeed You Black Emperor. When I started listening to the band last year, I became unhealthily fascinated with the idea of Armageddon. f#a#oo and Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada played out like monolithic reminders of the temporary nature of our civilization-- two separate scenarios for the imminent demise of western culture. The former pointed toward a brooding, gradual disintegration; the latter suggested an explosive, blood- soaked revolution. A Silver Mt. Zion, a Godspeed side project featuring guitarist Efrim Menuck, bassist Thierry Amar, and violinist Sophie Trudeau, forgoes the thick, orchestral sounds of the MontrÃ©al nine-piece, opting instead for a more subtly orchestrated three-to-five-piece arrangement. The result is a sound that, while every bit as powerful as that of Godspeed, is in many ways more affecting. Whereas Godspeed present a sometimes overwhelming wall of sound, A Silver Mt. Zion have turned that intimidating sonic behemoth into a sparse, penetrating beast tearing limb from limb. Musically, He Has Left Us Alone but Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corners of Our Rooms lives up to its name; silence is prevalent throughout the record. Painting analogies are natural when discussing this kind of music-- the musical elements are arranged in strokes of color on a white canvas. But an abstract art analogy is even more appropriate, as He Has Left Us Alone is almost completely devoid of percussion, allowing the album to achieve a more sweeping dynamic. Adding to the profoundly personal nature of the record is the relative lack of tape- recorded wackos ranting about the end of the world. There's some highly jumbled speech about Jesus on the opening track, ""Broken Chords Can Sing a Little,"" but aside from that, Efrim Menuck himself has taken on the majority of the record's vocal duties. Initially, it's quite clear why this is the first time you've heard Menuck sing-- his voice sounds like a more nasal (yes, that's right-- more nasal) Wayne Coyne. But on further listen, the inherent nervous and unrefined nature of Menuck's voice becomes remarkably affecting. He Has Left Us Alone is a work in two movements, ""Lonely as the Sound of Lying on the Ground of an Airplane Going Down,"" and ""The World is SickSICK; (So Kiss Me Quick)."" While the former does feature occasional lapses into very Godspeed-esque taped vocals and reverb-drenched drumming, the latter marks the most beautiful music Efrim Menuck has ever committed to tape. Angelic violin and plucked cello floats over sparse organ chords, with indistinguishable noises playing through the background. Of course, He Has Left Us Alone will not rub everyone the right way. Godspeed, if not the most pretentious band ever, is certainly the most pretentious band ever to come out of Canada. And in case you haven't figured it out from the album and movement titles, this record carries all the same elements of pretentiousness as Godspeed, including the long album title and cryptic cover art. But rather than using pretension as an excuse for a shitty record, A Silver Mt. Zion utilize the universally binding emotional effects that this particular brand of ""pretentious"" music can have on listeners. For the most part, He Has Left Us Alone breaks little ground in how it conveys emotion, employing descending chromaticism coupled with occasional major thirds to evoke a perpetual sadness, broken by occasional glimmers of happiness. What makes the album such an accomplishment is the fact that these standards have been implemented with passion, skill, and above all, an almost supernatural talent. He Has Left Us Alone serves as the perfect companion to f#a#oo and Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada. Those records are haunting reminders that the world must eventually come to an end; this album is a reminder that when the world ends, you end, too.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7165-he-has-left-us-alone-but-shafts-of-light-sometimes-grace-the-corners-of-our-rooms/,Constellation,2000.0,"If you're familiar with the genre of post-rock and haven't yet given A Silver Mt. Zion's ""He Has Left Us Alone but Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corners of Our Rooms"" a listen, let me give you a piece of advice: stop what you're doing and put this album on right now. 

A Silver Mt. Zion is a Canadian band founded by Efrim Menuck, who also co-founded the renowned post-rock group Godspeed You! Black Emperor. ""He Has Left Us Alone"" was actually the band's debut album and was released in 2000 under the band's original name, A Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band. 

What sets this album apart from many other post-rock albums is its hauntingly beautiful combination of instrumentation and samples. The group features strings, horns, and percussion, with occasional additional samples of static, speeches and other sounds. The album is a collection of instrumentals and one spoken word piece, each carrying intense and somber emotions. It sounds like something you might hear in a film's score rather than something played on the radio. 

One of the most intriguing aspects about this album is its creation story. The title track was born out of sadness and grief. After the passing of Menuck's grandfather, he found himself struggling to cope with his emotions. He decided to sit down with his guitar and started improvising various riffs and melodies, recording the whole process. What he didn't know at the time was that he was actually creating the backbone of ""He Has Left Us Alone."" He proceeded to share the recordings with his fellow bandmates, who then added their own layers of instrumentation until the album was complete. It's a deeply personal album that is rooted in Menuck's grief and sadness, but it's relatable to anyone who has experienced loss. 

My personal favorite track is ""13 Angels Standing Guard 'Round The Side Of Your Bed,"" which features a somber guitar line along with a stunning violin solo. The repetitive structure of this piece gives it an almost hymn-like quality, which makes the added samples all the more haunting. It's a track that has stayed with me long after the last note fades away. 

In terms of rating, I'd give this album a 9.0 out of 10. It's a post-rock masterpiece, standing the test of time as one of the genre's most hauntingly beautiful albums. If you're looking for something to play on a quiet night or when you're in need of some reflection, A Silver Mt. Zion's ""He Has Left Us Alone"" should absolutely be on your radar.","1.

El Perro Del Mar,KoKoro,Rock,7.1,September 14 2016,Benjamin Scheim,Contributor,"KoKoro, the latest album by El Perro Del Mar, takes its title from the Japanese word meaning heart or feeling, and from there you get a hint of what’s to come on: new musical terrain informed by an exotic “Far East” sensibility, couched in familiar El Perro Del Mar territory of melancholy and vulnerability. Almost 12 years into her career as El Perro Del Mar, founder Sarah Assbring’s appetite for reinvention remains strong. On KoKoro, the Swedish singer’s fifth album, her global wanderings bring her to unfamiliar places with inspiring albeit uneven results that showcase an artist who could easily make a turn for pop stardom. Assbring has said that she’d been listening heavily to Japanese, Chinese, and Cambodian ’60s pop prior to the making of the album, but the influences of these sources on KoKoro are so overt and jumbled with modern pop and world music sensibilities, it comes off as a hodgepodge of cultural tourism. Throughout the album, Assbring utilizes classical Asian and Middle Eastern instruments such as the Chinese stringed guzheng, the Japanese shakuhachi, and various other flutes and strings—all played by a cast of Swedish musicians—and features rhythms and melodies casually identifiable with all of the above backgrounds along with Ethiopia, Egypt, and Indonesia. Coordinated or not, Assbring does a remarkably good job taking all of these sounds and fusing them into vibrant, bouncy pop songs that are miles away from the ’60s-inspired tunes of her early career. It wasn’t until 2012’s Pale Fire that Assbring first attempted to seriously change up the El Perro Del Mar sound, but while it was evident that her voice and talents could translate to more radio-friendly dance-pop, the album frequently played like feathery nostalgia for late ’90s lounge house and trip-hop. On KoKoro, however, Assbring seems to have figured out the transition, and its strongest cuts are her best arguments yet for shifting the El Perro Del Mar paradigm. “Kouign-Amman” (a type of French pastry) blends Assbring’s pan-Asian fetish with spunky futurist pop. Exploding from the speakers with a sunny and reverbed vocals, Assbring weaves in a guzheng string melody in a way that feels organic and enmeshed rather than simply appended. Title track “KoKoro” comes the closest to true 21st-century world music, with a huge, echoing “kinda Middle Eastern” chiftetelli beat and bleating flutes. Assbring’s voice is also loud and present, living in the fabric of the song in a way that it never did on Pale Fire. It’s music for smiling under the late afternoon sun on a party boat on the Bosphorus with a crew of happy hedonists. Best of all, if not quite as archly pop as the others, is the stunning baroque opener “Endless Ways.” Featuring delicately embedded strings and backing vocals that moan and tug, “Endless Ways” is a perfect synthesis of all of El Perro Del Mar’s developments as an artist. Lyrically it also represents an important touchpoint for Assbring’s transformation, outlining her sense of self-reflection in figuring out how to become a better artist: “I think I was too softly defined/I wish I was all pure/The goal I have is carved in my mind/Perfection is hard.” It sure is, but as pop songs go, “Endless Ways” certainly gets close. Because of Assbring’s attempts at drawing from these ethnocultural traditions without a sense of clear rhyme or reason, its weaker compositions sound more “White Euro-Woman Does ‘The Far East’” rather than the breezily blended post-globalization culture mashes of M.I.A. Tracks like “Ging Ging” and lead singles “Breadandbutter” and “Ding Sum” don’t just feature the aforementioned guzheng for flair but spotlight it as a conspicuous driver of sound to a degree that feels fetishized rather than borrowed. KoKoro isn’t perfect, but Assbring’s knack for creating well-written, catchy melodies carries the record it even in its slightest moments and a huge step forward from Pale Fire, positioning El Perro Del Mar well for an interesting Act II as a modern world pop purveyor.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22306-kokoro/,Control Group,2016.0,"Welcome to the world of El Perro Del Mar, where the boundaries of rock music are constantly being tested and blurred in the most captivating way possible. I am glad to share my thoughts on their latest album, KoKoro, which exudes raw energy and creativity that is simply unparalleled.

Before diving into the tracks, it is essential to understand the journey that led El Perro Del Mar to this point of musical mastery. The band's founder, Sarah Assbring, has been crafting her unique craft for more than a decade now, and KoKoro serves as a culmination of her musical skills.

Assbring admits, in various interviews, that KoKoro proved to be a significant challenge in its making. She was determined to create an album that challenged their previous work, and that would show significant growth, evolution, and experimentation. As such, the album was recorded over 18 months during which numerous setbacks were experienced, including writer’s block, technical issues, and a few false starts.

It all paid off, though, because the final product is truly remarkable, and in my opinion, one of the best albums the band has ever made.

The album's title track, ""KoKoro,"" sets the tone for what's to come. With its rhythmic guitar riffs, synth layers, and '80s-inspired drum kit, the track is a masterful blend of rock and electronic music. The song is full of melancholic tones, reflecting the emotional messages infused in each track.

The album’s lead single, ""Mirrors,"" was released during the album's recording period and is a testament to Assbring's stunning vocals as well as the band's sophisticated style. Starting with haunting harmonies and progressing to dramatic drums, the track is a sonic journey that highlights introspective and existential themes of self-image. Personally, “Mirrors” is my favorite track on the album, and I find myself turning to it constantly.

The third track, ""Endless Ways,"" is perhaps the most daring and experimental song on the album, and it showcases the band's willingness to push the boundaries of rock music. As the song ignites, you can hear the early influences of The Cure, and The Psychedelic Furs in the moody, synth-riddled mix, which is then elevated by a powerful guitar solo.

With KoKoro, El Perro Del Mar has crafted an album that is both heart-warming and heart-wrenching. It is a musical journey that showcases the band’s creativity and passion and tells a personal story that resonates with all listeners. From start to finish, songs blend together effortlessly, creating a cinematic experience that is nothing short of a masterpiece.

In conclusion, KoKoro is worth every second of your time. It's a poignant, ambitious and beautifully executed album that deserves the accolades that it has received thus far. Whether you're a fan of rock music, electronic music, or just incredible musical art, this is an album you need to experience for yourself. Here’s to hope that the band will continue to forge ahead with their remarkable artistic pursuits.","1. Review A mentions the specific influences that El Perro Del Mar drew upon for the album.

Bloc Party,Bloc Party EP,Rock,8.0,September 29 2004,Brian Howe,Contributor,"I'll say this for Bloc Party: They know who Bertrand Russell is. He's quoted in their online bio: ""Collective fear stimulates the herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd."" The text proper unfolds in the utilitarian language of a socialist pamphlet. References to writers like J.G. Ballard and Richard Brautigan accrue like patches on an emo kid's hoodie. These guys have read some books, and aren't afraid to say so. That said, it's surprising how little of their intellectual fodder has found its way into their discourse. If they've read Russell, they've probably read his pupil, Ludwig Wittgenstein, who would strongly disapprove of their dogmatic imprecision: In one illuminating incident, the ever-crotchety philosopher responded to a comment about the beauty of a particular tree by asking with irritation, ""What do you mean by that?"" Bloc Party thinks that the trees are beautiful and society is screwed, but it's a bit unclear what they actually mean. The dominant paradigm hardly seems subverted by lines like, ""We don't read the papers, we don't read the news/ Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled."" It's a little galling when namedrops outweigh insight in ostensibly political music, but hardly shocking. In an era when many think Che Guevara sang for Rage Against the Machine, you only have to mention the names of great thinkers to blow minds. Luckily, Bloc Party fare much better musically than they do rhetorically-- there's nothing ambiguous about their rollicking, poppy post-punk. In terms of influences, one wants to say-- you're going to groan-- Gang of Four, The Fall, and Wire. I know, you're thinking: Do we really need any more post-punk fetishists? When they're this on point, yes. The best post-punk stems from the construction of a perfectly balanced machine, where manic energy, peristaltic rhythm, crisp shifts in intensity and tempo, and heartfelt sloganeering achieve a thrumming equilibrium. Bloc Party just fucking nail these precarious dynamics on what's shaping up to be the new-wave anthem of the year, ""Banquet"", which opens and closes this EP. The rigid, crashing drums, the dueling staccato guitars, the standard-bearing vocal volleys and strategically deployed ""ah-ooh's"" add up to a textbook Gang of Four fist-pumper. The ""Banquet"" remix boils the song down to drums, bass, squirrelly embellishments and ephemeral guitar gestures, creating an expansive echo chamber for the powerful vocal track. Hell of a set of pipes on that guy. The nervy guitar spirals and call-and-response verses of ""Staying Fat"" are punctuated by Bloc Party's ace-in-the-hole: the soaring chorus, where the syncopated voices merge into towering, horizon-breaking harmonies. The cyclical, droning ""She's Hearing Voices"" was the British single, and it's a curious choice, since its churning atmosphere is the least poppy effort on the EP-- would it be asking you to swallow too much if I said it sounds like Isaac Brock jamming with TV on the Radio? Mark E. Smith might consider a plagiarism suit upon hearing ""The Marshals are Dead"", but would hopefully be too charmed by the strangely beautiful indie-prog of ""The Answer"" to follow through. Bloc Party's politics may be a bit inchoate, but in this sort of music, shouting about a ""new world order"" is a familiar trope that's ultimately more palatable than the millionth pledge of apathy in an indie-rock song. If intellectual constructs must be reduced to genre signifiers, I suppose that calls for revolution are at least more invigorating than celebrations of indifference. In an era of moral relativism and political ambivalence, you have to give it to Bloc Party for singing like they mean it, even if they don't make explicitly clear what ""it"" is.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1129-bloc-party-ep/,Dim Mak,2004.0,"If there was ever a band that embodied the heart and soul of post-punk revivalism, it would undoubtedly be Bloc Party. Founded in 1999 in London, they’ve gone on to be one of the most exciting acts to come out of the UK in the last twenty years. The Bloc Party EP, their debut, is a testament to the band's contagious energy, raw talent, and unique take on the rock genre. 

One of the most immediately striking things about this album is how it sounds like the perfect amalgamation of the UK's post-punk and indie-rock scenes. Each track is overflowing with infectious riffs, pulsing rhythms, and a catchy sense of melody. “Banquet,” one of the album's standout tracks, is a prime example of this. The opening guitar riff is instantly memorable, and the lyrics add another layer to the song, giving it a deeper sense of meaning.

What's even more impressive about the album is how the band manages to tackle complex and emotional topics with such ease. From the hauntingly melancholic “Staying Fat” to the upbeat and optimistic “She's Hearing Voices,” their debut demonstrates the type of emotional range and depth that is rare in a first album.

The Bloc Party EP also bears the mark of a band that is truly committed to their art. Every track is polished and perfectly crafted, a reflection of the time and effort the band put into creating these songs. The production is top-notch, adding just the right amount of gloss to the raw energy that permeates every moment of the album.

Personal opinion-wise, as someone who has been a fan of Bloc Party for a number of years, I can attest that this album holds up incredibly well even after repeated listens. It's a testament to the band's talent and the quality of the music that they've managed to create something that is both timeless and timeless in equal measures.

Overall, the Bloc Party EP is a must-listen for anyone who loves energetic and thought-provoking rock music. It's fresh, exciting, and showcases the band's potential for a long and illustrious career. In a nutshell, it's one of those rare debuts that sets the tone for the band's future, and it's safe to say that Bloc Party truly delivered with this one. The album deserves a solid 8 out of 10, a rating that only hints at the brilliance of the music within.","1.

Lydia Ainsworth,Darling of the Afterglow,Experimental,6.6,April 15 2017,Rachel Hahn,Contributor,"It’s difficult to parse the myriad influences of Toronto-based composer Lydia Ainsworth. At the time of the release of her Juno-nominated 2014 debut Right From Real, she was as likely to pay tribute to the three-part harmonies of Bulgarian folk singers as she was to the Spice Girls. As if challenging herself to come up with an even more disparate set of touchstones to describe her new LP Darling of the Afterglow, Ainsworth offered up her most mystifying set of references yet, characterizing the album’s lead single “The Road” as “a marriage of Enya and the Weeknd.” This unholy matrimony is, surprisingly, an apt descriptor for many of the 11 songs on Afterglow. While Right From Real showcased her taste for baroque orchestration with a minimal electronic backbone, they were all a bit too off-kilter to be described as bona fide pop songs; “Malachite” and “White Shadows” were far too mystical and ethereal to draw comparisons to Max Martin’s pop. Although Ainsworth has said that some of the songs on Afterglow were in gestation around the same time that she was writing her debut, she composed others during a brief stint in L.A. while writing pop songs for other artists. Her embrace of more mainstream songwriting is evident even in the first few seconds of opener “The Road,” as dramatic piano chords sustain over dark synths that phase beneath her newly confident voice. Ainsworth’s more traditional vocal performance is one of the most striking evolutions of her sound. Whether heavily processed on “Hologram” or spliced into sharp daggers on “Moonstone,” Ainsworth’s voice sounded interwoven into Right From Real’s ornate symphonic textures. On Afterglow, she centers her voice to sound more expressive and lucid than ever. On “Ricochet” Ainsworth stretches her voice to its limits, ascending to a soaring falsetto, luxuriating over the softness of her consonants, and in a more familiar vein, pitching it down to harmonize with itself. While this would seem to be an unequivocal step forward, Ainsworth can succumb to melodrama; the twinkling guitar and whispered double-track vocal that composes the first half of “Open Doors” evokes the broad, histrionic effect of a band like Evanescence perhaps more than Ainsworth would like. While the appeal of Ainsworth’s debut existed in its refined hybrid of orchestral synthpop, here Ainsworth confoundingly falls back on cheesy banjos (“What Is It?”) and crunchy guitars (“I Can Feel It All”) to embellish her already fussy arrangements. The latter song, another one of the album’s high points and one of its more strictly synthpop numbers, seems to reach a climax in the last quarter when she unleashes blaring, rich synthesizers that rumble beneath her coos. The arrangement is already over the top, but Ainsworth’s stadium-ready guitars overload the song entirely. When the so-called “left-of-center pop” album is executed well, it’s exhilarating (see Ainsworth’s Arbutus labelmate Mozart’s Sister or fellow synthpop seductress Jessy Lanza for recent examples). Ainsworth’s tightened up her songwriting, emoting more profoundly than ever before, but she’s abandoned the more restrained instincts that once made her spectral music so lustrous. She hasn’t yet sorted out the particular combination of influences that fit her strengths, and few of the songs’ melodies are compelling enough to overcome the album’s strangely stale take on alternative pop. Ainsworth is clearly a knowledgeable composer with endless sources of inspiration to work with, but *Afterglow *proves that finding the perfect formula is sometimes more complicated than one might imagine.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23144-darling-of-the-afterglow/,"Bella Union,Arbutus",2017.0,"If you're anything like me, you appreciate a good experimental album. There's something enticing about being able to explore uncharted musical territories while still maintaining a semblance of structure. And let me tell you, Lydia Ainsworth's ""Darling of the Afterglow"" does not disappoint.

Before diving into the album itself, it's worth noting that Lydia Ainsworth is no newcomer to the music scene. This Canadian singer-songwriter has been honing her craft for years, releasing her debut album, ""Right from Real,"" in 2014 to considerable critical acclaim. And with ""Darling of the Afterglow,"" Ainsworth has solidified her status as one of the most exciting experimental artists currently working.

The creation story of ""Darling of the Afterglow"" is one that's both fascinating and personal. Ainsworth has noted that many of the songs on the album were written during a time when she was grappling with the loss of several loved ones. And while some may assume that a mournful tone would dominate the album, that couldn't be further from the truth. Yes, the songs are emotionally charged, but there's an underlying sense of hopefulness that permeates throughout.

From the opening track, ""The Road,"" it's clear that Ainsworth is embracing the unconventional. The song begins with a pulsating beat that quickly transforms into a layered soundscape. Ainsworth's voice is hauntingly beautiful as she sings, ""I never knew which way to go,"" and it's impossible not to be drawn in.

One of my personal favorite tracks on the album is ""What Is It?"" On this song, Ainsworth's vocals are particularly ethereal, and the electronic elements are woven together so seamlessly that it's difficult to imagine any other arrangement. And while the lyrics are somewhat abstract, there's a sense of desperation that's palpable.

""Ricochet,"" on the other hand, is one of the more upbeat tracks on the album. Ainsworth's voice is crystal clear, and there's a certain playfulness to the instrumentation that's infectious. And yet, even in this more lighthearted moment, there's still a sense of loss and confusion.

Overall, ""Darling of the Afterglow"" is an album that demands to be experienced. It's a journey through grief and hope, and Ainsworth masterfully guides the listener through these emotions with grace and skill. While some experimental albums can feel overwhelming or self-indulgent, that's not the case here. Instead, Ainsworth has created something truly special - an album that's both deeply personal and universally relatable. If you're looking for something fresh and thought-provoking, ""Darling of the Afterglow"" is an excellent choice.","1. Review A uses complex sentence structures and a more formal language.

The Album Leaf,In a Safe Place,"Electronic,Rock",7.9,July 6 2004,Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,"When Sigur Rós' breakthrough sophomore record-- the perpetually lingering Agaetis Byrjun-- was released internationally in late 2001, ecstatic scribes across the globe simultaneously tensed and paused, curling over their cheap notebooks, chewing on ballpoint pens, and trying, desperately and collectively, to conjure the perfect glacial metaphor, to birth a descriptor appropriately gnarled and vast, to ink the impeccable (and inevitable) line from Iceland's craggy landscapes to Sigur Rós' dark, desolate compositions. Since then, Iceland's sprawling horizon has become an oddly ubiquitous touchstone for describing contemporary American music, with loads of new bands snatching their spectral bits from Sigur Rós' massive arsenal of otherworldliness. Tristeza's Jimmy LaValle, who has been recording spare, instrumental hymnals as The Album Leaf since late 1998, is the closest North American equivalent to the pale Nordic maestro, and his pockets are well-stuffed with the papers to prove it: After touring extensively with Sigur Rós (who frequently joined LaValle onstage), LaValle was shuttled-via-invite to Mosfellsbaer, Iceland to record at Sundlaugin, Sigur Rós' home studio, borrowing their string section, Amina, and collaborating with vocalist Jon Thor Birgisson and members of (fellow Icelandic howlers) Múm. The resulting record, The Album Leaf's third, is a collection of wispy rock songs peppered with sputtering beats, vocals, Moog, and gently whining strings. Curiously, LaValle's portrait of Iceland presents a far cooler vision than his guides' ever have: In a Safe Place is occasionally chilling, a studied, calming slice of icy serenity. With tinkling Rhodes piano, glockenspiel, and subtly propulsive percussion, In a Safe Place is the sound of slowing down; the record feels tired-but-satisfied, like crawling home after a long night of misadventures, burrowing into the backseat of a cab, squinting your eyes at the light buzzing across the horizon, tying your shoes, and thinking hard about blankets. LaValle has always masterfully straddled the thin, gray stretch between Saturday night debauch and Sunday morning remorse, and In a Safe Place exists almost exclusively in the moments where nothing feels quite real, the place LaValle calls ""safe."" The Album Leaf is a solo effort, but LaValle is famously collaborative (he's also been tangled up with The Locust and GoGoGo Airheart), and, in addition to Birgisson, The Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins is often present to coo along to LaValle's gleaming cuts. Still, it's LaValle's own vocal contributions-- his first time singing with The Album Leaf-- that hit first and hardest. ""On Your Way"" sees LaValle chanting carefully along with Jenkins, singing high and flat over a pinging bit of melodic space-pop; their respective imperfections shine like bits of red mitten stuck to a frozen window, awkward and stupidly beautiful. Birgisson's contribution-- the impeccably weird ""Over the Pond""-- is sung in his trademark Hopelandic, and features backing samples of his own vocals, whirled into cartoon hysterics. ""Over the Pond"" is insistently haunting, a meditative, piano-heavy examination of intangibles, as satisfying as it is vague. Detractors will be sure to note that In a Safe Place can feel numbingly repetitive at moments, but all that expansive diddling contributes equally to the record's allure: Like rolling past the North Pole or through West Texas, this record plays with its own redundancies, building an entire universe from strange, barren pieces. In the end, it all spins into nothing.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/101-in-a-safe-place/,Sub Pop,2004.0,"If you're looking for an album that merges electronic music with a touch of rock, then look no further than The Album Leaf's ""In a Safe Place."" With a rating of 7.9 out of 10, this album is certainly worth a listen, regardless of whether or not you're familiar with their music. 

The Album Leaf, led by Jimmy LaValle, has been around since the early 2000s and has been making music for over two decades. Their music often infuses electronic sounds with indie and ambient styles, creating a sound that is distinctively theirs. In fact, In a Safe Place is no exception, with its beautiful melodies and gentle whispers that make this album come alive.

The creation story of the album is one of the most intriguing aspects of the album. The album was recorded at a church in Iceland, with collaborators like Sigur Rós, who helped bring a new level of emotion and power to the album. The church setting also added to the newfound depth of the album, as the album's acoustics were able to capture every single note, making it seem like the album was written and recorded specifically for this locale.

When I first listened to In a Safe Place, I was hooked. The opening track, ""Window,"" sets the tone perfectly, capturing the melancholic beauty that permeates throughout the album. The piano melody in ""Thule"" is one of the most perfect pieces of music I've heard in a long time, with its gentle yet persistent melody that somehow manages to stay in your head long after the album has finished. The title track, ""In a Safe Place,"" is undoubtedly my favourite track on the album, with its beautiful piano melody and haunting vocals that add a sense of depth and power to the album.

Overall, In a Safe Place is a well-produced album that combines electronic sounds and rock elements in a meaningful and powerful way. It's unique, beautiful and deeply emotional, making it a must-listen for fans of the genre or those who want something fresh and new. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is looking for music that is not just beautifully crafted, but emotionally moving as well.","1.

Sun Ra,Singles,Jazz,8.7,December 3 2016,Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,"How do you pin down Sun Ra? The cosmic jazzman laid down so much music it would take a warehouse of full-time historians working round-the-clock hours to figure it all out. Albums were often hastily assembled from his prolific sessions, packaged with DIY artwork and sold at gigs for quick cash. Thousands of hours of unheard recordings are rumored to exist. Maybe he stacked boxes of magnetic tape on far-away planets too, such was his connection to the stars. If it’s even possible to traverse the vast Sun Ra universe on board a single starship, then Strut Records’ new compilation Singles: The Definitive 45s Collection offers a compellingly sturdy vessel.  It’s a 65-track set of 7-inch fragments of the celestial god, sent to earth to help us map out details of his galaxy that the albums could not. There are no wasted motions here: Each flat, wax disc represented another bright star in the constellation Ra. The name of his birth certificate read Herman Poole Blount. Born in Alabama in 1914, the mysterious musician showed up in Chicago in 1946 with little more to his name than a jail record picked up for refusing to fight in World War II for ethical reasons. The jazz scene was primed for revolution and Blount moved to a different beat, driven by a journey to Saturn he claimed he made years earlier while in deep spiritual concentration. The star man would later take up the name Sun Ra, form his ever-changing band the Arkestra, and spend a lifetime teaching the world Afrofuturism, a complex ideology of Black nationalism, Egyptian myth, scientific discovery, science fiction movies and the other-worldly fashion choices he’d flaunt on-stage. Forget “Disco 2000”; Sun Ra was envisioning to the paranoid blips and beeps of “Disco 2021” some 30 years before Pulp showed up. He mastered the electro squiggles of “Planet Rock” prior to the birth of hip-hop, and forged his own form of analogue cyberpunk as Philip K. Dick sat as his typewriter laying out his own dark vision of the future. Singles preserves all that for future generations. It’s said when you watch classic movies like Citizen Kane today, it’s important to bare in mind that these movies were writing the rules of filmmaking that we now take for granted. Sun Ra’s music somehow doesn’t require that kind of explanation. As soon as the needle drops, it sounds like scripture—a key testament that formed a building block of a half-century of music. Everyone from George Clinton to OutKast read from The Book of Ra. And yet, on paper the project seems an odd prospect. Sun Ra was a lot of things—pianist, bluesman, bandleader, arranger, interstellar poet, multiverse traveller—but he’s never been accused of being a singles artist. Because of the format, Singles eschews his lengthier wigouts for shorter vignettes. You might not get the 20-minute avant-garde virtuosity of “Space Is the Place,” but you do get jaunty holiday jingle “It’s Christmas Time.” That might seem less crucial, but when grappling with Ra’s slippery legacy, nothing here feels disposable. For the fanatics, *Singles *will offer little they’ve not heard before. While the original 45 versions of a lot of these songs, many of which were released on Ra’s own El Saturn Records, are rare (or, in some cases, completely lost), they’ve all cropped up in other places, including a similar-but-less-expansive compilation put out by Evidence Records in 1996. Still, there’s undoubted power in hearing Ra’s career laid out like this. Arranged chronologically (or as close to it as possible—Ra wasn’t exactly pedantic when it came to labeling his sessions) and with about half the songs recorded during his 1950s Chicago period, Singles captures the genesis of his forward-thinking space-bop. Fittingly, the opening two tracks, “I Am an Instrument” and “I Am Strange,” both spoken-word numbers, predict his metaphysical interests. “I belong to one who is more than a musician/He is an artist,” he says on the former. His voice is tuned low and grave, as though foreshadowing a seismic event. Whether he’s envisioning a playful, pamphlet-utopian version of the city on the Lieber-Stoller-esque “Chicago USA” or mixing experimental rhythms with dense and fractured chants on “Spaceship Lullaby” (both recorded with the Nu Sounds, an important precursor to the Arkestra), it’s thrilling to hear Ra connect Chicago’s timeless jazz scene to his increasingly wild tinkerings. Even the earliest material on* Singles *is the sound of a bandleader confidently wielding his arsenal for maximum purpose. It’s not just Ra that gets shine. Singles captures The Arkestra at their finest. John Gilmore, a chief lieutenant in the group for almost 40 years, blusters with his tenor saxophone on the peppy “Soft Talk,” recorded in his first few years alongside Ra. The gentle horn riff of “Space Loneliness”—from 1960, Ra’s final year in Chicago—pulls you towards the void of the outer cosmos before blissful and delicate solos from Phil Cohran (cornet) and Marshall Allen (alto sax) chime in. Given the nature of the format, Singles also showcases Ra’s pop instincts. Whether it’s the smooth doo-wop of “Daddy’s Gonna Tell You Know Lie” (of which there are two versions), the wild-man energy of singer Yochanan on blistering R&B number “Hot Skillet Momma,” or Hattie Randolph’s sweet rendition of jazz standard “Round Midnight,” it’s a thrill to hear Ra carve out lean jukebox jams. On “Bye Bye,” the sweet harmonies of the Cosmic Rays are drowned out by short, sharp skewering of double bass that tears through the final few seconds. Recorded a decade before George Martin was doing that sort of thing, it confirms that even in the pop realm, Ra was a daring futurist. The later work sees Ra fully exploring the outer realms of his own talent. “Disco 2021” sounds like an android’s fever dream. A doomed but dinky organ holds hands with a Gilmore-led wind quartet on the ugly-beautiful “Outer Space Plateau.” Ra incorporates a Moog synth into “The Perfect Man”; probably recorded in mid-1973, he deploys a bluesy horn riff as the bedrock before running wild with the synthetic instrument. It’s a strange mismatch, but “The Perfect Man” feels like a rare link between dapper nightclub blues and the space-bound sounds of new wave, disco and early hip-hop. The song encapsulates Sun Ra’s freewheeling, alien brilliance. The London-based Strut Records has long been prolific in unearthing and reissuing old music and has gotten pretty damn good at it. The three-disc CD and LP releases of Singles: The Definitive 45s Collection includes a lot of the trimmings you might expect: rare photos, artwork, sleeve notes and an interview with El Saturn Records founder Alton Abraham. There’s also detailed track-by-track and session notes by project compiler Paul Griffiths that you’ll open up a lot as you grapple with this set. Strut is experienced in dusting off old recordings, so the remasters sound crisp—particularly when played back-to-back with versions that cropped up on other compilations—but without suffocating that rich 45rpm flavor. In addition to the CD and digital releases, Strut is putting out 20 cuts from the collection in two 45s box sets (Volume 1 released this month, Volume 2 released in March 2017) in a limited 500 copies run for the dedicated looking to fully immerse in the spirit of their original releases. For newcomers here for spiritual guidance, broaching Sun Ra’s seismic life work can be daunting. To penetrate the outer atmosphere and splash down into an unknown world; to crawl into a mind of a man with the power to transport his consciousness across our solar system.* Singles* offers a wide-ranging but accessible route to his unearthly sounds.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22639-sun-ra-singles/,Strut,2016.0,"Singles - A Jazz Masterpiece by Sun Ra 

When it comes to jazz music, few names can evoke the kind of enigmatic, experimental energy that Sun Ra can. The late pianist and composer had a career spanning over 50 years, in which time he released over 100 albums. But one of his most unique and standout records is 'Singles.' 

The album came out in 1996 as a compilation of singles that Ra released through various labels between 1952 and 1961. Despite the varied sources, the tracks on this album come together cohesively, showcasing different sides of Ra's sound without ever feeling disjointed. The end result is a jazz masterpiece that effortlessly blurs the boundaries between tradition and experimentation. 

As I listened to this album, I couldn't help but to be transported to another time and place. The music flows with a whimsical, cosmic energy that's unlike anything I've ever heard before. It's at once disorienting and thrilling, with each song taking twists and turns that keep me on my toes. There are moments of free jazz inspirations, bebop rhythms, and blissful harmonies that converge into something that feels impossibly futuristic. 

The beauty of Sun Ra's artistry is that he never wants to stay in one place for too long. It's admirable that he had the musical dexterity to jump in and out of different styles with ease. The opening track, ""I Am An Instrument,"" sounds like a full band is playing, but it's only Sun Ra on a Wurlitzer electric piano. ""Plutonian Nights"" features great solos from Ra and John Gilmore, while ""The Blue Set"" has a playful rhythm section anchored by Ra's deliciously disorienting keyboard sound. 

Throughout the album, we get glimpses of a genius at work. Someone who saw the music form as a flexible system that could accommodate edits to create new sounds. Sun Ra is like a sonic architect, one who could bend the laws of physics with his compositions. There's something magical about the way he circumvents time signatures and chord progressions, creating room for delightful moments of surprise and delight. 

As a jazz enthusiast, I tend to be a bit tough on albums that fall below my expectations. But with 'Singles,' I can't help but feel enchanted. Listening to it is like discovering a new world where anything is possible, impossible music is made possible. Sun Ra's creativity is humbling, in the sense that it reminds us of the vast potential that can be achieved through dedication, hard work, and experimentation. 

Overall, 'Singles' is a remarkable portrait of Sun Ra's singular vision. While not for everyone, jazz lovers who appreciate the adventurous nature of the genre will be pleased with what they hear. With an 8.7 out of 10 rating, it's clear that this album deserves a spot among the jazz greats. It's a testament to Sun Ra's legacy and to the power of music to transport us to new and exciting dimensions.","1.

Amusement Parks on Fire,Amusement Parks on Fire,Rock,6.6,October 6 2005,Jason Crock,,"If you don't fall in love with Amusement Parks on Fire's self-titled debut after the first few notes of ""Venus in Cancer"", you never will. A throbbing dose of 4/4 overdriven pop, the song casually channels the melody from Dinosaur Jr.'s ""Little Fury Things"" via frontman Michael Feerick's smooth delivery, which conveys a sense of angst without over-emoting. It's an impressive feat considering Feerick recorded the album entirely on his own, but after you've heard the first two tracks-- the slow-building, piano-and-strings instrumental ""23 Jewels"" that leads to ""Venus""-- you've pretty much heard the entire record. As the album proceeds, APOF's waves of distorted guitar continue to rise and fall and the instrumental breathers come at just the right moments, but there are no more tricks up Feerick's sleeve. ""Venosa"" delivers jagged guitars and a jaunty melody, and it's followed with another plodding piano-driven instrumental, ""Asphalt (Interlude)"". Even the moments of derivation, like the tape-recorded dialogue over the breakdown in ""Eighty Eight"" or the gradual crescendos and declines of the eight-minute ""Wiper"", seem predictable. At times, the transitions between tracks can be charming-- ""The Ramones Book"" is a modest, maudlin piano ballad that kicks unexpectedly into the soaring shoegaze of ""Local Boy Makes God""-- but the album simply revisits the same couple of sounds. It's not just that the pacing is so methodical it nearly makes the record sterile, or that the best song just reminds me of someone else's better song, but for all of the overhwlelming guitars layered onto these songs, sentimental ballads like ""The Ramones Book"" are what's at the record's heart. My perception might be colored by hearing the ""rustic"" version of ""Venus in Caner"" from that song's single release, a precious acoustic rendition that stands perfectly on it's own. It was a revelation: These tracks aren't bult to bruise, they're bedroom pop in a blanket of distortion as a defense. Feerick's simple melodies sound much more apt with subtle coloration instead of overkill. Amusement Parks on Fire has undeniable focus, but it's moments like ""The Ramones Book"" that reveal the most.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/486-amusement-parks-on-fire/,Filter,2005.0,"Amusement Parks on Fire is a band that has always been on the edge of great things, but never quite made it. However, with their self-titled album, released back in 2005, they created something that truly showed their potential. Combining elements of shoegaze, post-rock, and psychedelia, this album is a true gem for fans of modern rock.

The band was formed in 2004 in Nottingham, England, by Michael Feerick. It was a time when shoegaze and post-rock were making their way back into the music scene, and Amusement Parks on Fire quickly became known for their unique take on these genres. The self-titled album was recorded and produced by Feerick himself, and it features a mix of catchy hooks, fuzzy guitars, and intricate melodies.

One of the things that stand out about this album is the way it seamlessly blends different styles of rock music. For instance, ""Venus in Cancer"" starts with a dreamy and delicate guitar riff before transitioning into a massive wall of sound that is both intense and beautiful. The album also employs a lot of different instrumentation, which helps to keep things interesting. There are plenty of moments where you'll hear synths, horns, and even a harp, adding an ethereal quality to the music.

While the album as a whole may not be perfect, there are certainly some standout tracks. ""Eighty Eight"" is a perfect example of what the band is capable of when they're firing on all cylinders. The opening riff is catchy and energetic, and the chorus is huge and anthemic. It's the kind of song you can imagine thousands of people singing along to at a concert.

It's clear that the band put a lot of work into creating this album. The production is top-notch, and the attention to detail is impressive. However, there are a few moments where the album feels a bit inconsistent. The middle portion of the album drags a bit, and some of the songs don't quite hit the mark. However, the album finishes strong with ""A Star Is Born"" and ""Venosa,"" two songs that showcase the band's ability to create emotional and atmospheric music.

In conclusion, Amusement Parks on Fire's self-titled album is a great example of modern rock music. It's not perfect, but it's a strong debut album that shows off the band's potential. If you're a fan of shoegaze, post-rock, or psychedelia, you should definitely give this album a listen.","1.

Johan Agebjörn,Casablanca Nights,Electronic,6.7,May 23 2011,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"The title of producer Johan Agebjörn's new album isn't necessarily a reference to the 1942 Bogart-Bergman film or to the Moroccan city where it was set. Instead, it's almost certainly a nod to Casablanca Records, one of the most prominent labels of the 1970s. While it did sign the likes of Cher, Kiss, and Parliament, Casablanca was best known as a haven for disco artists, including Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, Santa Esmeralda, Village People, and a deep roster of one- and no-hit wonders. It's even rumored that Steve Guttenberg's character in the Village People film Can't Stop the Music was based on Casablanca founder Neil Bogart (no relationship to Humphrey). It's no shock that Agebjörn would invoke this bellwether of pop history for his latest album. He is one of several Swedish producers enamored with various American and European strains of disco, and his two albums with Sally Shapiro reveal a steadfast belief that heartache is best conveyed via soft vocals, shimmery synths, modulated bass lines, and pulsating beats. Casablanca Nights is his chance to play curator as well as producer, hand-picking such acts as Shapiro, CFCF, Friday Bridge, and Le Prix. The album plays like a label sampler you might dig out of the dollar bin and wonder why none of the artists made it bigger. Despite that title, Agebjörn isn't abandoning his signature Italo disco-derived sound for a more American style. His production remains exquisitely lush and luxuriant. On ""The Last Day of Summer"", the relatively robust vocals by Queen of Hearts stand out on the album, and it's too bad she doesn't appear more often. Many of the vocalists blur together over the course of Casablanca Nights, although Shapiro remains Agebjörn's most captivating muse, her expressive vocals illuminating each one of her songs. Most of Agebjörn's songs create the same sort of yearning, thumping dancefloor melancholy, differentiated more by their lyrics than by their instrumentation or their tone. As Casablanca Nights makes its way to morning, he introduces a few new sounds and tricks, to varying degrees of success. ""Alice"", a collaboration with Le Prix, Fred Ventura, and Shapiro, is the most intriguing detour, drumming in some new wave influences from the early 1980s to counterbalance the 1970s sounds. Thanks to the halting chorus and the dynamic boy-girl vocals, the combination of styles is intriguing, not only because these two eras have such different concerns but mostly because similar experiments on Casablanca Nights prove much less compelling. By the time the requisite chill-out closer comes along-- ""Stranger (Chill Remix)"" with Halftone-- Agebjörn has already thoroughly chilled out to a sequence of downtempo songs like ""Le Noir et le Blanc Sur le Piano"" (where Shapiro sings in French) and ""Memories of Satie"" (with CFCF). Intriguing in their reach if not necessarily their execution, those two numbers weigh down the second half, such that ""Stranger"" doesn't sound like the sunrise to end Casablanca Nights, but an abrupt finale that plays to a long-empty dancefloor. Granted, Agebjörn's intention isn't historical re-creation or even dance-party endurance, but a kind of musical evocation that opens up more conceptual possibilities than perhaps he's willing to explore. Yet, this time-machine quality means the music serves similar purposes to its influences: The songs are meant to be immersive, enveloping, and most of all transportive. Where disco went far beyond mere escapism in the 1970s, Casablanca Nights only gets you out of 2011 for a few sweet minutes.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15394-casablanca-nights/,Paper Bag,2011.0,"Hey, music lovers! I recently got my hands on the album 'Casablanca Nights' by Johan Agebjörn and let me tell you, it was a sonic adventure worth having. 

Let's start with a bit of history. Johan Agebjörn is an electronic music composer from Sweden who began his journey in music back in the late 1990s. He has collaborated with other prominent artists in the likes of Sally Shapiro and Le Prix, to name a few. 'Casablanca Nights' is his latest offering, a 10-track ensemble that boasts of eclectic sounds, ambitious production, and emotional depth.

The creation story of the album is fascinating. Agebjörn wanted to embody a world full of musical and cultural diversity in his compositions, and he spent a few weeks in Casablanca, Morocco, recording the music and collaborating with local artists. The result is a blend of electronic beats and traditional North African instruments, with a heavy emphasis on melody and harmony. There is no shortage of creativity in this album, as each track has a unique personality and a different story to tell.

Now, let's talk about my personal experience listening to 'Casablanca Nights.' I have to admit that I am not a huge fan of Electronic music, but this album was a pleasant surprise. The intricate rhythms and the exotic melodies of the music transported me to another place, far from where I was. There's a sense of wanderlust that is present in every track, and I found myself lost in the soundscapes that were created. The album is best listened to in one sitting, as it takes you on a journey that is worth experiencing.

However, while the album has its moments, it does have a few drawbacks. The production lacks the punch that one would expect from an electronic album, and its subdued nature may put off some listeners. Additionally, some tracks feel a bit repetitive, and the lack of variation in the instrumentation throughout the album may prove to be a hindrance to some listeners.

Overall, 'Casablanca Nights' is an album that deserves attention, especially if you are a fan of electronic music. It is not perfect, but it is a testament to Agebjörn's musical prowess and his ability to weave different influences into a coherent whole. I would give this album a solid 7 out of 10.","1.

Ulrich Schnauss,Missing Deadlines: Selected Remixes,"Electronic,Rock",6.1,March 26 2010,Patrick Sisson,Contributor,"As a teenager in Kiel, Germany in the early 90s, Ulrich Schnauss discovered bands like Ride and My Bloody Valentine by tuning in to British armed forces radio. ""As soon as I put the headphones on,"" he says, ""the world seemed to be a nicer place.""Â Nearly 20 years later, after three albums and a slew of remixes, Schnauss still seems engrossed with those lush sounds. Like Sonic Cathedral, the British club night and label that embraces shoegaze in all its permutations, he takes a wide-angle view of the genre, seeing it as a current that runs through many different eras. The solid source material he reworked for the remix collection Missing Deadlines-- which ranges from solo work by members of Slowdive and Ride to songs by Rainbirds' frontwoman Katharina Franck and the John Tejada/Takeshi Nishimoto project I'm Not a Gun-- speaks to this sense of related history and possibility. Taken as a whole, though, Schnauss' treatment of these tracks is aesthetically redundant. Prone to creating ethereal music that sometimes skews toward being too amiable, many of Schnauss' remixes sound like pretty shoegaze setpieces, orchestrated to create a familiar emotional payoff with tricks we've heard many times before. While he pulls some of the songs in a more dance-friendly direction, his bent guitars, clouds of static, and vocal echoes have a way of blending together here. Take Madrid's ""Out to Sea"", a track built around bright synths, gentle guitar, and breathy vocals. Schnauss' remake bathes it in warm synths and gauzy vocals, softens the guitar, and washes out the sound, placing a halo around the song for emphasis. That dreamy haze also seeps into his treatment of ""Remembrance"", a single by the Joy Division-influenced Dragons that's smoothed over with bent vocals and thick, swirling layers of suspended synths. Mojave 3's epic ""Blurbird of Happiness"" has a warm, rambling vibe that Schnauss over-accents with nature samples and back-masked glockenspiels that sound like wind chimes. Orbital-like echoes are applied to Juanita Stein's vocals on Howling Bells' ""Setting Sun"", maintaining the track's sensual groove, while the rhythm of A Sunny Day In Glasgow's ""Ghost in the Graveyard"" is brought more to the fore until it sounds a bit like M83. But redundant or not, Schnauss knows how to create sweeping, emotive, grandiose music-- and his remix of Mark Gardner's ""The Story of the Eye"" gets it right by bulking up the track, trading the quiet focus and slow bassline for vocal layers and accordion-like synths. Schnauss always adds a certain signature to his remixes, but it's not always clear if making something busier necessarily makes it better.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14037-missing-deadlines-selected-remixes/,Rocket Girl,2010.0,"If you're looking for an album that encapsulates the perfect mash-up of beats and rock energy, then ""Missing Deadlines: Selected Remixes"" by Ulrich Schnauss is nothing short of a masterpiece. With a combination of electronic and rock, the album successfully blends two different genres to create a sound that's fresh and engaging.

Ulrich Schnauss has been in the music scene for over two decades, and his works have been held in high esteem due to their unapologetic approach to genre-bending. This album is a testament to that approach, and it's one of the boldest projects of his illustrious career. Schnauss has a unique musical vision, and in this album, he doesn't disappoint.

""Missing Deadlines: Selected Remixes"" is an ambitious project that Schnauss embarked upon. The album is a collection of his finest remixes over the years. Each track is a reinterpretation of some of the most famous songs of our time, and he has added his own unique touch to them, breathing new life into each of them. The album also features collaborations with a few notable artists, and these collaborations have resulted in some of the finest tunes on the record.

The album comprises 11 tracks, and each track stands out in its own right. There are subtle changes in tempo and beat that keep the listener engaged throughout the runtime of the album. The tracks are a perfect blend of electronic and rock, and it's clear that Schnauss has put in a lot of effort to ensure that each track is a masterpiece in its own right.

In my opinion, ""Gone Forever"" is one of the standout tracks on the album. The track starts slow, but as it progresses, it transforms into one of the most haunting melodies you'll ever hear. Schnauss has done an excellent job of adding his own personal touch to the track. The other track that I found myself repeatedly coming back to was ""On My Own."" The beat change is simply amazing, and the track is high energy from the very start. The energy never drops, and it's a perfect pick-me-up if you need a boost during your day.

Overall, ""Missing Deadlines: Selected Remixes"" is an album that's well worth a listen. It's a testament to Ulrich Schnauss's creativity, and it's an album that's sure to stay with you long after the beats have stopped ringing in your ears.

Various Artists,Nothing Left to Lose: A Tribute to Kris Kristofferson,,7.6,December 1 2002,William Bowers,Contributor,"Shame on those of us who only know Kris Kristofferson as the kindly carny in Big Top Pee Wee, the Harry-Crews-looking, homicidal constable in Lone Star, or the silly scruffs in Blade II and Tim Burton's toneless Planet of the Apes remake. Shame on those of us who only know him as the guy with the feathery hair on the cover of some album we saw stacked inside one of Mom's crapboard endtables alongside Lionel Richie, Air Supply, and those hunky Kenny's: Loggins and Rogers. Shame on us, because the very educated Kristofferson was an estimable American songwriter (though I have to pitch my tent across the field from those who'd label him one of the Greats). Kristofferson's most impacting work strings together the observations of chronically defeated visionaries. These mini-martyrs can be absorbedly self-pitying, like prisoners who pay lip service to free livin', but their capacity for surrender yields some powerfully fatalistic evaluations of hope. ""Jesus Was a Capricorn"" is possibly the best synthesis of Kristofferson's concerns (Low's messianic hypothesis ""If You Were Born Today"" owes this tune a debt), and Diana Darby's minimal, whispered rendition is only one of the reasons this compilation trumps 2002's other Kris-nod Don't Let the Bastards Get You Down. This disc's roster is largely a who's-who of subdued alt-folk-rock, both traditional and progressive. Souled American's slop-twinkle handling of the last-chance anthem ""Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends"" is both brainy and sentimental, ideal for those fidgety hours before one's pride allows them to hit the bar or bottle. Both Califone offerings, ""Borderlord"" and ""Nobody Wins"" (the latter a team-up with Rebecca Gates) prove my thesis that this band doesn't know how to bore: they use all manner of digital manipulation, yet still sound earthy and interplanetary, yet symphonic and hymnal, despite their static-blasts. They contrast overstated and understated percussion, they strain pianos-- they even serve up some phased Olivia Tremor Control transitions. Calexico defies their predictable cactus-funk formula by adding an amazingly sour organ tone and Nico-versus-Marlene-Dietrich vixen vox to ""Casey's Last Ride"". Radar Brothers' deservedly increasing fanbase should pounce all over their panoramic ""Help Me Make It Through the Night"", and if my ears don't lie, that's Brother Jim Putnam's thin-soul throat fronting a much warmer Court & Spark on their ""For the Good Times"" (one of at least three songs about opportunistic ex-couples saying ""What the hey, let's get it on""). The showoffs in Zmrzlina and Milkchopper create the comp's richest soundscapes, mixing six-string theatrics with windshield wipers, drum tracks, radio samples, anxious keys, doleful strings, and layered, coed vocals. Their pairing deconstructs Kristofferson's most famous song to the point of redefinition, editing the refrain down to, ""Freedom's just another word for nothing."" The rest acquit themselves as well: Richard Buckner is a moving fit for the strumming ""Loving Her Was Easier"" ; Crooked Jades make a hootenanny of ""Shipwrecked in the Eighties"". Virgil Shaw and Howe Gelb both tip their hats amenably to the outsider ethos, but Deanna Varagona threatens to over-sing Kris' great line about ""seeking salvation we don't understand."" Creeper Lagoon's ""Why Me"" and the Handsome Family's ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" are decent, but labor in the shadows of Johnny Cash's and Crooked Fingers' recent revisitations. Only Grandaddy's power-trio take on ""Best of All Possible Worlds"" (the polar opposite of the version from Bernstein's Candide) reeks of sleepwalkers' drool. You could insert a lengthy rumination on the futility/plurality of tribute compilations here, but recall that the oft-covered Kristofferson reportedly wrote a song called ""Let's All Get Together and Steal Each Other's Songs"". To their considerable credit, most of the artists on this austere compilation strive to give a little back.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4539-nothing-left-to-lose-a-tribute-to-kris-kristofferson/,Incidental,2002.0,"The ""Nothing Left to Lose: A Tribute to Kris Kristofferson"" album is a stunning and emotional tribute to one of the greatest singer-songwriters of our time. As a fan of Kris Kristofferson, I was excited to see this tribute album come to fruition, and I have to say it did not disappoint.

The album consists of various artists who pay homage to Kris Kristofferson by singing his most beloved hits. Each track is a unique interpretation of his music and serves to showcase the amazing versatility of his artistry. The music genre of this album is nan, and it carries a rating of 7.6 out of 10. To say the least, it is a work of art that draws on various genres of music to summon the spirit and soul of each song.

The creation story of this album is an interesting one. The idea for the album was sparked by Kristofferson's recent struggle with memory loss, and a desire for his music to continue living in the hearts of his fans. The album's producers were able to bring together an eclectic group of artists, some of whom personally knew Kristofferson and others who have been influenced by his music. The result is a beautiful and moving tribute that captures the essence of Kristofferson's legacy.

As I listened to the album, I was struck by how each artist brought their unique style and sound to the songs. There are a lot of highlights on this album, but some of my personal favorites include ""Help Me Make It Through The Night"" by Alison Krauss, ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" by Jamey Johnson, and ""Me and Bobby McGee"" by Lee Ann Womack. These tracks, along with the others on the album, do an incredible job of capturing the raw emotion and soul of Kristofferson's words and melodies.

In conclusion, ""Nothing Left to Lose: A Tribute to Kris Kristofferson"" is a must-listen album for any fan of Kristofferson's music or anyone who enjoys soulful and emotional music. The album's ability to bring together such a diverse group of artists to pay homage to one of the greatest singer-songwriters of our time is truly remarkable.

Roy Ayers,Virgin Ubiquity: Unreleased Recordings 1976-1981,"Jazz,Rock",7.3,April 12 2004,Andy Beta,Contributor,"After three weeks of hard freeze, of slipping on mutt-stained patches of frost and iced Brooklyn gutters, with December's cigarette butts still suspended in February's frozen amber puddles, the cold snap finally snapped, and thermometers inched above zero degrees. Just to feel the sun cut through the blustery wind promised the approach of spring, and it was then that I relied on vibraphonist Roy Ayers to help soundtrack and celebrate warm weather's imminent return. Best known for ""Everybody Loves the Sunshine"", Ayers and his vibes are like those same solar rays on your skin; for me, this batch of grooves was a salve for staving off seasonal depression. Not quite on par with, say, James Brown uncovering hours of tape from his on-the-one prime, the promise of prodigious unreleased songs from the peak of Ayers' powers is reason to take notice nonetheless. Since his 1963 debut, Ayers has worked with everyone from Herbie Mann and Guru to Fela Kuti and Erykah Badu, and his shimmering sound has foreshadowed acid jazz and fueled hip-hop, as well as gracing contemporary R&B.; Though Virgin Ubiquity is billed as a collection of thirteen never-before-released tracks, it's far more than a mere scrap heap of outtakes, as each of its ""from the vault"" cuts luxuriate on the comfortable musical bed that Ayers mastered from '76 through '81. Originally of the hard bop school, Ayers embraced the strains of black music coming from the radio, incorporating more R&B; smoothness and disco push into his jazz-based playing. That so-slick sound of joy reverberates through titles like ""What's the T?"" and ""Green and Gold"", proving the vibed tinges of his loving funk to be almost ageless. The only suggestion of dating comes from the revolving cast of ladybirds, who imitate the leather-lunged female vocal style of the day, piercing through the brass and bass in the manner of disco-divas like Patti LaBelle and Minnie Riperton. The wailing of both Merry Clayton and Sylvia Cox counteracts the otherwise mellow bump of ""Brand New Feeling"", as they match the analog sine waves with some dog-whistling of their own. But when both ladies lay off the caterwauling, the vibraslap and horn lines recline like a cat napping in a patch of warm light. More soothing is Carla Vaughn, who would go on to sing with Earth, Wind & Fire. Here, she flutters on suave yet tricky tracks like ""Mystic Voyage (Version)"" and ""Boogie Down"" (wherein she urges her lover with the undeniable order ""pour yourself on me""). ""I Am Your Mind', the final track, is the most driving of the 13 presented here, its hard, snapping bass underpinning the multi-tracked whispers, which are a curious bit of what could only be considered ""solipsistic funk.""

The Blow,Brand New Abyss,Pop/R&B,5.8,September 21 2017,Brian Howe,Contributor,"The Blow has always bundled electro-pop, twee-punk, and performance art into spindly confessionals, but it has done so in three distinct incarnations. First, as the millennium turned, it was Khaela Maricich’s solo project, lo-fi and artsy-cuddly in the K Records tradition. Second, in the mid-2000s, it was a sleeker collaboration between Maricich and YACHT’s Jona Bechtolt, like mussed up Metric for northwestern punk kids. And third, since around 2007, the Brooklyn via Oregon band has been the combined effort of Maricich and Melissa Dyne, a conceptual installation artist who initially enhanced the Blow’s concerts and then began to work with Maricich on the music. This iteration of the Blow is behind its first new album in four years, Brand New Abyss, in which Maricich’s spiky sensitivity comes in a redesigned container. Moving away from digital composition, the duo ventures into modular synthesis, patching together a rig of analog oscillators and filters and then half teaching it to speak, half learning its language. It makes a huge difference that the music is grounded more in space and time. Unfortunately, it’s not an entirely positive change. It seems that bouncy samples mutate into loquacious indie pop more readily than rudimentary analog synthesis does. Maricich doesn’t always adapt her grid-forged singing style to fit these blurrier compositions, and two odd cover choices cast long, puzzling shadows. When it comes to covers, intention—as expressed through the rendition—matters. We need to feel there’s an idea beyond the wan rush of hearing a familiar song in a new context. But it’s hard to fathom what the Blow intended with their out-of-focus cover of Eagles chestnut “Peaceful Easy Feeling.” The production is thin and simplistic. The vocal melody is tentative, as if Maricich hadn’t completely decided how to phrase it before recording. One wants to read something subversive into her take on lyrics about “what a woman can do to your soul,” but the arch, quizzical tone doesn’t feel subversive. This isn’t an errant deep cut; it’s the album’s first song, and it sets an emotionally inscrutable frame around everything that follows. “Dark Cold Magic” is much more appealing and legible, though the vocal line still can’t help but feel a little desultory with such sparse harmonic and rhythmic material to work with. This is an ongoing issue; the compositions are too often limited to a big bass plodding out a slow, simple melody under a thin scrim of atmospheric effects. But “Dark Cold Magic” and “Think About Me” are affecting performances of intimacy, sure to cast a starry mood at concerts. They showcase Maricich’s insightful, ambitious lyrics about obsession, heartbreak, and reconciliation, in which, through protracted puns, rhetorical overreach is transmuted into relatable vulnerability. A cover of “The Greatest Love of All,” popularized by Whitney Houston, sits in the center of the album like a stone. The vocal arrangement, again, seems listless and haphazard. The approach to the material betrays neither joy nor relish; the song is neither met on its glorious terms nor stripped down to reveal something hidden inside it. You’d almost think the Blow were just mocking a cheesy pop song, relying on a twinge of ironic recognition, but that can’t be right (punk and indie bands have been covering pop songs for decades). Still, the decision to emotionally cauterize an anthem that connects with millions is truly confusing. But then, at the halfway point, the record starts to find its stride, divulging exciting glimmers of a fully formed new direction. The Laurie Anderson-like sprechgesang of “The Woman You Want Her to Be” makes so much more sense with the sparse sonic palette than strained R&B vocals do; it’s like Maricich stops fighting against the music and feeds it the texture and language it’s starved for. Full of acute emotional shades and vivid social scenes, it’s also genuinely funny. The same is true of “Get Up,” which nudges into rap, and the album starts to inflate with a confidence and ease that is scarce on the first half. If the Blow were to retire right now, Maricich could make a claim few can—she wrote a perfect song. “True Affection,” with that unforgettable lift in the vocal line during the chorus, was a flawless example of the burbling warmth and immediacy of Postal Service-era electro-pop. This was 2006, when Bechtolt’s suave electronics aided Maricich in toying with pop idioms from bounce rap to soft rock with a lot of musicality and a minimum of winking. Brand New Abyss, by its exploratory nature, doesn’t aspire to such great heights. But this valiant yet flawed endeavor feels more like a false start than a dead end, if the Blow keeps watering the ideas seeding the back half and stays away from karaoke.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-blow-brand-new-abyss/,Self-released,2017.0,"The Blow's latest album, ""Brand New Abyss,"" is a journey that manages to be simultaneously exhilarating and introspective. After a bit of digging into the band's history, it seems like this particular journey was a long time in the making.

The Blow's career has spanned almost two decades, with Khaela Maricich and Melissa Dyne forming the duo back in 2002. They released albums sporadically, with ""Paper Television"" being the big breakout success in 2006. After a hiatus, they were back in 2013 with a more electronic-leaning sound on ""The Blow,"" and now they're back again with ""Brand New Abyss.""

This new album was apparently created in the midst of personal turmoil, right on the heels of the 2016 election. Maricich describes the experience as ""a dark night of the soul,"" and that feeling is evident throughout the album. It's a more introspective, contemplative sound than what we've heard from the band in the past. 

One of the standout tracks is ""Dark Cold Magic,"" a track that starts with pulsing synths and Maricich's haunting vocals. The chorus hits with a wave of emotion, as she sings ""I tried to love you, but love is not enough."" It's a feeling that anyone who's been through a tough relationship can relate to, and it hits hard. 

""Get Up"" is another highlight, with a groovy bassline and lyrics that encourage the listener to keep pushing through the hard times. Maricich's voice has a confidence and strength to it that really shines on this track. 

The album's title track, ""Brand New Abyss,"" is a hopeful message in the midst of darkness. Maricich sings ""We'll make a brand new abyss / And I'll meet you on the other side,"" a sentiment that feels particularly poignant in the wake of the past few years.

Overall, ""Brand New Abyss"" is a solid album that showcases The Blow's ability to evolve and adapt their sound. There are moments of sadness and moments of hope, all wrapped up in a pop/R&B package. While it may not be the band's strongest album to date, it's definitely worth a listen – particularly for anyone looking for a little bit of introspection and catharsis in their music.","1.

Pauline Oliveros,Reverberations: Tape & Electronic Music 1961-1970,"Electronic,Experimental,Rock",9.0,June 5 2012,Brian Howe,Contributor,"With about 10 other people, mostly strangers, I reclined on the floor of an international hand-drum emporium and closed my eyes. We were all trying to cross the internal divide between ""the involuntary nature of hearing and the voluntary selective nature of listening,""Â which seemed like it could mean a lot of different things. To me, it was about trying to experience sounds for what they were, not what they meant. The hum of a refrigerator and the whoosh of traffic gradually drifted away from their mundane contexts, revealing the variety and interconnection of what I was conditioned to hear as generic and separate. It was harder to detach the clock's tick from turning gears and passing time. In the moments when I could, I felt very free. The occasion was a Deep Listening session with certified instructor Shannon Morrow. Deep Listening is less of a thing you do than a way to do all kinds of things-- perform, meditate, communicate, compose, or just be in the world. It's hard to summarize but easy to grasp: a set of broadly accessible philosophies and practices for heightening your awareness of total sound. It's useful for anyone who wants to develop a musical practice or unlearn conventional sonic hierarchies. It's also the core of the art of its creator, Pauline Oliveros, the 80-year-old composer, accordionist, teacher, and electronic music pioneer who easily ranks among the most innovative and influential musicians of the mid-20th-century avant-garde, which still strongly governs experimental music today. She wasn't the first to become entranced by the pops and whistles in the nether regions of the radio band. But she was one of the first to do something about it, focusing on frequencies instead of melodies, motions instead of rhythms, processes instead of outcomes. Oliveros only formalized Deep Listening a couple of decades ago, but her curiosity to hear sound out to its very edges-- plus the ingenuity to pull it off-- has been apparent since she made her earliest works on a new frontier cluttered with magnetic tape, hulking computer rigs, tone oscillators, and primitive modular synthesizers. These are collected for the first time on Reverberations: Tape and Electronic Music 1961-1970, a monumental box set from Important Records. One advantageous thing about tape music is that the performance is also the recording, so there was no shortage of material for this retrospective, which fills a dozen discs in almost as many hours. While any massive tape music collection will have its share of desultory windshear, the vision and variety of Reverberations are incredible, and feel surprisingly untarnished by 50 years of imitation. In the music, two distinct intelligences, one human and one mechanical, circle each other cautiously but inquisitively. We hear unpredictable occurrences, captured in the moment of discovery, becoming first principles for a new generation. During the 1960s, in the musically thriving Bay Area, Oliveros counted the likes of Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Loren Rush as her compatriots. She played accordion in the premiere of In C. She founded the San Francisco Tape Music Center with Morton Subotnick. She was in the thick of the pure electronic phase predating her seminal electro-acoustic work, using natural sounds and raw test signals as fodder for processing systems of her own design, which could be played almost like instruments. This distinguished her from her contemporaries, most of whom were meticulous cutters and splicers. Her reel-to-reel delay system predicted Brian Eno's, but instead of dreamy melodies, she stuffed it full of splintering tones, working with magisterial patience through the kaleidoscope of possibilities in the particular control system. The music comes off as incidentally imagistic, but the answerless fact of sound is paramount. It's an elaborate magic show of competing frequencies, which apparently can do very weird things if you know what you're doing, as when a harmony swallows its own root notes so that we hear two absences ringing in tune. Reverberations feels contemporary, with its twitters and howls and eerie near-vocalizations; its hypnotic flux and explosive events. It should, as it lays substantial groundwork for every electronic drone artist and harsh noise terrorist to come-- anyone who relies on signals behaving semi-predictably to tap into an intuition beyond human capacity. On the spectrum of intensity, Oliveros runs from Keith Fullerton Whitman subtlety to John Wiese violence. This speaks to a certain posture of benevolent radicalism that has been as influential as her technical innovations. A substantial booklet of essays accompanies this release, and a revealing moment comes in one by the artist Cory Arcangel, who studied music with Oliveros. He recalls her fondly describing a performance in the 60s where she tuned oscillators to the frequency of the hall, so the sound multiplied and sent people screaming. ""I want to send people screaming from institutions!"" Arcangel thought. The dawn of electronic music must have been an ideal time for that, when a second horizon appeared in music above the first one we'd chased for so long. It's harder to scandalize the academy now, but people are still trying. I can't even claim to have heard every minute of Reverberations. I tried to play it in my house from morning to night one day, and it was, of course, overwhelming. I found it more interesting to listen to the same parts and notice how they changed each time. From a Deep Listening perspective, the music is completed by its total sonic environment, which is always different. Listening to the 30-minute-plus ""Angel Fix"" for the first time, it took a while to realize the birdsong entwined in the loopy high frequencies came from the screen door and not the speakers. This porous boundary between music and world is immediately associated with John Cage, but Oliveros was right there with him, if not slightly out front; she was just behind Stockhausen in developing a common tongue for electronic music. She built technology we take for granted today, listened carefully to what it had to say, and then brought it back into a humanistic and acoustic process during what may be considered her prime career, from the 70s onward. But that would be a discredit to the groundbreaking work captured on Reverberations. Eerily listenable despite its daunting mien, it also has one of the rarest virtues: necessity. If it didn't exist, neither would music as we know it today.",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16664-reverberations-tape-electronic-music-1961-1970/,Important,2012.0,"When it comes to electronic and experimental music, the name Pauline Oliveros stands out. The innovative composer and musician changed the game for not only electronic music, but for music as a whole. Her album Reverberations: Tape & Electronic Music 1961-1970 perfectly exemplifies just how far she pushed the boundaries of what was possible with sound.

Oliveros' journey began in 1952 when she began studying composition at San Francisco State College. From there, she explored sound and composition in various ways, eventually becoming a pioneer of what is now known as ""deep listening"" - a practice that involves tuning in to the sounds around us in a more mindful and intentional way. Oliveros' approach to music reflected this philosophy, and it shows in her magnificent creations.

Reverberations is truly a remarkable album, consisting of 11 tracks that showcase Oliveros' incredible talent and creativity. The album is a retrospective collection of her early work, including pieces that incorporate tape manipulation, electronic sounds, and even guitar.

The tracks on the album are moody and atmospheric, with each one taking the listener on a unique journey through soundscapes that vary from chaotic and noisy, to peaceful and introspective. The album's opener, ""Time Perspectives,"" is a great example of the former, with a frenzied and disorienting tape manipulation that tears at the edges of the listener's perception.

On the other hand, tracks like ""Big Slow Bog"" are much more meditative, with a sound that evokes the sensation of floating in a cosmic void. The album is a true testament to Oliveros' ability to evoke deep emotions and moods with her compositions.

Reverberations is, without a doubt, a rewarding experience for the listener who is willing to dive in and truly listen. Oliveros' dedication to her craft and her willingness to experiment with sound is inspiring, and this album is a testament to her powerful legacy. If you're a fan of electronic, experimental, or rock music, this album is a must-have for your collection.

Personally, I found myself lost in Reverberations' depths, feeling as though I was floating in a void of sound that was both exhilarating and peaceful. Oliveros' connection to sound is truly otherworldly, and it's evident in every track on this incredible album. She was a true force to be reckoned with in the world of music, and Reverberations is a fitting tribute to her brilliance.

On a scale of 1-10, I have to give Reverberations a solid 9.0. It's an essential and timeless album that deserves a spot in every music enthusiast's collection.","1. Review A includes more intricate language and sentence structure, suggesting that it was generated by a machine learning model.

Har Mar Superstar,The Handler,"Pop/R&B,Rock",1.9,September 15 2004,Johnny Loftus,,"When you're three albums into a joke that wasn't too hot to begin with, you need to explode your bit to WK-like extremes. It's the only way to make the dead horse speak-- jab its flank with a Linda Perry hypo and first-team production values. Neptunes, The Matrix, whoever. The decision to go Big Empty probably won't score you any Shortlist Prize nominations, and Jay-Z might never toast you in the VIP, but your ridiculous gasbag of an album will make a few Coconuts endcap trollers happy, and will maybe even rock the exurbs for a few more blips of summer. Sure, you'll just be another link in the wallet chain, but at least you'll be platinum. And MTV2 will shake your hand at the Billboard Music Awards, offering you a folded-up sawbuck and a job as a presenter. Who's laughing now, right? Taking that route to the rotting top of Mt. Smart Aleck would be laughable, yet acceptable, for a guy like Har Mar Superstar. It's a living and all that. But this portly Minnesota vice hasn't made any of those kinds of career-boosting concessions. Rather, he's kept his sound... well, pretty much exactly the same. Once again, The Handler mostly offers service industry beats and the Minneapolis kid's same old jag of groupies' panties stories. But there is at least one new wrinkle: Har Mar occasionally steps up the proto-electronic prattle of his past from its unsultry soul-jam roots to Chingy-style pop-rap. Opener ""Transit"" travels without moving to a geeky Stevie Wonder falsetto while banal disco bumps at midtempo in the background, finally culminating with you-know-who leading a girls-on-boy call-and-response of which he is naturally the center of attention: ""Har Mar is so sexy! Har Mar is so sexy!"" Right, we heard that before, and it still isn't true. Not that The Handler doesn't have its notable moments: If you wanna hear Karen O pretending to pork a fat fuck, she and Har Mar huff and puff over a splooging 80s pop retrofit called ""Cut Me Up""; ""DUI"" (""Dialing Under the Influence"", natch) is a harmless enough distraction for white college kids to hook up to; and sooner or later, Har Mar gets around to teabagging Holly Valance: The Aussie hottie appropriately tarts the Missy Elliott reset ""Back That Camel Up"". But the record is still mostly filler-- a hook for the gaudy live show-- proving again that there wasn't much to the Har Mar joke to begin with. Do you miss the maudlin keyboard pacing and foofy harmonica sound of 1985 soft-rock, best typified by ""That's What Friends Are For""? Then by all means, invest some time in The Handler's ""Sugar Pie"". Perhaps you want swishy raps about Freaky Freezies and public nudity, pinned halfheartedly to Taco's take on Irving Berlin's ""Putting on the Ritz""? ""As"" has an endless supply of tan lines, popsicles, sun block, and flip-flops. But then, even Taco himself got that kind of action at the peak of his fleeting fame skid. If Har Mar Superstar had taken his catchphrasing and ponce-preening to I Get Wet levels, The Handler might at least flaunt some radio-compressed hooks, Pink and DMX guest shots, and more songs like ""DUI"" that hug the line between Beck and dreck. But these productions are skeletal at best, mainstream kitsch-pop on a Casio budget. As such, The Handler only meagerly amplifies what he was already doing, probably pleasing his no doubt respectable cadre of core followers, but handily turning off the rest of humanity. Seriously, dude, put your pants back on.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3738-the-handler/,Recordcollection,2004.0,"If you're looking for a unique sound that effortlessly blends together R&B, Rock, and Pop, look no further than Har Mar Superstar's The Handler. With a rating of just 1.9 out of 10, it's clear that this album hasn't received the recognition it deserves.

To truly appreciate The Handler, it's important to understand the band's history and the album's creation story. Starting out as a one-man band in the early 2000s, Har Mar Superstar (aka Sean Tillman) has evolved into a full-fledged musical powerhouse. This latest album showcases his incredible range as a vocalist and songwriter, with catchy hooks and a variety of musical influences.

While some may dismiss this album as just another pop record, there's a depth and complexity to each track that sets it apart from the mainstream. From the powerhouse vocals on lead single ""Youth Without Love"" to the subtle and soulful ballad ""Personal Style"", The Handler is a well-rounded album that explores the nuances of love and loss in a way that is both relatable and thought-provoking.

As a listener, I was immediately drawn to the album's upbeat and infectious melodies. The catchy hooks and energetic beats kept me engaged from start to finish, even on the slower tracks. And while the themes of heartbreak and longing are universal, there's a vulnerability and rawness to the lyrics that hit me on a personal level.

While I understand that this album may not be for everyone, I truly believe that it deserves more recognition and praise in the music world. Har Mar Superstar has created something truly special with The Handler, and any true music lover would be remiss to pass up the opportunity to experience it for themselves.

"Dead Prez, Sticky Fingaz",Turn Off the Radio Mixtape Vol. 2: Get Free or Die Tryin',"Metal,Rap",4.1,December 1 2003,Rollie Pemberton,,"If you're reading this website, there's a relatively high chance that Dead Prez hates your fucking guts. It's nothing personal. Chances are, it's just the color of your skin. Sure, the group has historical evidence to back up some of their disdain for the other white meat, but in stark contrast to the creative narrative-based style of The Coup's Boots Riley and the abrasive, loudspeaker soundclash of Public Enemy, Dead Prez's music fails by sounding purely conventional and presenting their cause in the most ignorant manner possible. m1 and stic.man are the emcees behind the most popular anti-establishment, pro-black militant rap group today and they draw their lyrical fury from a history of drug dealing, dropping out of high school, and traditional ghetto upbringings. Their songs span a vast array of subject matter: disdain for the police, revolutions, drugs, depressed mothers, black power, the hood, revolutions, black power, dead homies, revolutions and black power. This in mind, there are only eight full-length songs and the best track is a remake. ""Last Days Reloaded"" is an exercise in how a new style of soundscape and limited exposure can help a group. Fredro Starr's dusty windsong production harkens back to Marley Marl, while the Dead Prez duo make good use of the backing (and original rhyme schemes of the Onyx classic) for the best song on the album. Most impressively is Sticky Fingaz returning to form in the face of one of his older great works, with ridiculously raw lines like, ""I done broke every rule in the good book/ Trust me, I've memorized the anarchist cookbook,"" and, ""Fuck it, throw me in jail, I need a vacation!"" The caveats of the Dead Prez movement are plentiful: The subject matter is underdeveloped and narrow, their guest emcees are less than sharp, and the album structure is made for abbreviated listening, yet comes off more loosely constructed than urgent. Most importantly, even though the artists speak about news reporters ""making scapegoats of every black youth on the corner"" and the death of Tupac with fervid emotion, they still manage to bore with their meandering song structure and lazy neo-soul choruses. The production is vastly disappointing when compared to their work with Kanye West and others on their near-classic debut. Most of the beats are skewed towards an embarrassingly dated Tupac bootleg album feel, while a scant few are reduced to tone-deaf bounce tracks that make Lil' Jon look like a platinum-clad Prefuse 73. Particularly unfortunate are Tahir's ""Paper, Paper"", sporting a melody that could easily pass for a child's first experiment with Mario Paint's music editor, and the fake piano and flat bass of ""Scared to Die"" by Askari X. m1 is currently dating Erykah Badu, and her influence is fresh in his sudden penchant for song. If Badu is responsible for Andre 3000's creative renaissance and Common's bad rapping/knitted hats, m1 will be rocking shows with red, green and black parachute pants, writing ballads about how his love for Badu is like a shotgun in a white man's mouth. Regardless of their good intentions, if Dead Prez were in place of Malcolm X in front of the pedestal, the shooters would be aiming for the mics and not their heads.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2530-turn-off-the-radio-mixtape-vol-2-get-free-or-die-tryin/,Landspeed,2003.0,"Dead Prez and Sticky Fingaz have teamed up to bring us ""Turn Off the Radio Mixtape Vol. 2: Get Free or Die Tryin',"" a unique blend of metal and rap that rebels against the mainstream music industry. 

For those who may not be too familiar with Dead Prez, they are a hip-hop duo from Florida who have been active since the late 90s. They are known for their politically charged lyrics and revolutionary message that encourages self-sufficiency and self-determination for black people. Sticky Fingaz, on the other hand, is best known for his work as a member of the rap group Onyx, and his acting roles in various movies and TV shows.

The album's creation story is just as interesting as the artists who made it. According to interviews, ""Turn Off the Radio Mixtape Vol. 2"" was born out of frustration with the state of the music industry. Dead Prez and Sticky Fingaz had grown tired of hearing the same mainstream artists on the radio, and decided to create an album that would empower listeners to break free from the monotony and be themselves. 

The album kicks off with the thunderous ""Warpath,"" which sets the tone for what's to come: heavy guitars and hard-hitting lyrics. ""The Awakening"" and ""Guerilla Funk"" follow, with equally powerful lyrics that speak to the struggles of black people and the need for radical change.

One standout track is ""Barbarians"" which features metal legends Slayer. The song is a perfect blend of rap and metal, with Sticky Fingaz and Dead Prez trading verses over Slayer's signature thrash metal sound. It's a testament to the artists' versatility and willingness to push boundaries.

However, not all tracks hit the mark. ""Don't Forget Where You Came From"" falls a bit flat with its simplistic lyrics and repetitive chorus. The album also suffers from poor mixing, with the metal instrumentals sometimes overpowering the vocals.

Overall, ""Turn Off the Radio Mixtape Vol. 2"" is a solid effort that delivers on its promise of rebellion and empowerment. It's not without its flaws, but the unique blend of metal and rap, combined with the message of self-determination and resistance, make it a standout album. Dead Prez and Sticky Fingaz have created something that challenges the status quo and encourages listeners to do the same.

But the thing with me and chicks isn't just that they're virtually always down there when I'm up here. The thing that gets me is that the guy she's with doesn't know any better than I do what's going on inside her head. As much as he smiles and nods along when she moves her mouth, no male will ever truly understand what females are ultimately up to. I can only guess that she stopped out there because she was drawn to the sweet pop music dripping from my stereo like an ant stuck in a puddle of honey. At least, this is how frustrated hetero males have been thinking for as long as the thoughts of frustrated hetero males have been recorded. Inked on papyrus, set in type, expressed in terms of humors, temperatures, and tides, and eventually grooved onto vinyl, it's a piggish sentiment backed by libido and ignorance (and more than a little unfair to women). It's also, oddly enough, a sentiment that's been the motivating force behind a great deal of beauty, most notably in pop music (possibly the greatest repository for male frustration ever created). Much of the time, male pop is trying to both seduce and explain the opposite sex in the same instant, knowing all the while that one of these objectives is a lost cause. Mercury Rev's All Is Dream claims its share of pop brilliance by taking up this position with enormous reserves of intelligence, grace, and emotion. As long-time Rev flautist Suzanne Thorpe-- who's been with the band since their sprawling psych-noise days-- has been demoted to the orchestra pit for this release, the band is now all-male. With Dave Fridmann mainly taking the role of expert producer (and making contributions on bass and mellotron) and Jimy Chambers passing the sticks on to new drummer Jeff Mercel, the core group is possibly the most stripped-down line-up in Mercury Rev's 10-year recording history. Though their approach hasn't changed from the radically orchestral turn of 1998's Deserter's Songs, these songs are far more personal than their last set. Even when bathed in Jonathan Donahue's constant wash of fever-dream lyrics, it's clear that these are Mercury Rev's first real (though predictably odd) love songs. ""If God moves across the water/ Then the girl moves in other ways/ And I'm losing sight of either,"" he sings in ""Nite And Fog,"" his collapsing love story gently suspended above its lyrical melancholy by the song's flowing strings and Fridmann's buoyant bassline. Throughout the album, Donahue takes the concept of woman as the proverbial ""other"" to an almost illogical extreme, funneling oceans of uncertainty into a female form and turning these emotions out again into uncomfortable reflections on death, fate, and all of those other nasty things. ""Tides of the Moon"" takes a typical image of femininity and transforms it into a meditation on loss and powerlessness (""The threads that run through your life/ Hang from your sleeve/ Wind through your soul/ The kind you can't control/ But wish you could break""), only to come back to the now-unsettling romantic sentiment, ""It ties you to me."" But even during all this, the band refuses to simply wallow in emotion, instead confronting their connections to pop lyricism smartly. On ""A Drop in Time,"" Donahue quips, ""Her words profane, her mouth divine/ I tried to sympathize with both sides/ But I was caught, like a floating thought/ Stuck inside of Leonard Cohen's mind."" As playful as they can occasionally be, though, Donahue's words are always rooted in nagging doubts and creeping riddles like those voiced by his creaky falsetto in ""Lincoln's Eyes"" (""What is dark like a birthmark/ Pulls like a magnet/ Male and female/ And covets like a dragon?""). The music, of course, is by no means as unstable as the lyrics. Where the band seemed a bit more easygoing and loose in their explorations of the orchestral-pop form on Deserter's Songs, All is Dream takes the band's newfound preoccupations in a definite direction. This makes the music sound a bit overdetermined at times (most notably, the opening track's calculated symphonic swells), but for the most part, their grasp of the sound has improved. The dark, driving rocker ""Chains"" cuts out at exactly the right moment, and bangs out a few cathartic Beethoven string hits before again steamrolling ahead. A soprano voice that sobs out the soft prelude to ""Lincoln's Eyes"" returns as a banshee-wail in the song's brink-of-chaos midsection, and the song returns obliquely to this sound in its gorgeous bowed-saws outro. ""Little Rhymes"" makes the most from its beautiful pedal steel lines, accentuating Donahue's melody without obscuring it. Of course, Mercury Rev don't need all this fancy instrumentation to get their point across. ""Spiders and Flies,"" a relatively simple piano ballad, stands as the most affecting song on the album. As Mercel caresses the keys, Donahue quietly unravels, confessing fears of death and disconnection from the unnamed female who's been flitting around the edges of the album the whole time. And, with shocking ease, the band shifts from these depths into the exultantly dreamy final track, ""Hercules."" As the song's percussive glee swells alongside guitarist Grasshopper's transcendently melodic noise solo, it becomes oddly clear that Mercury Rev has, in some way, come to love this uncertainty-- just as the pop protagonist can't stay away from the inscrutable object of his affections, and the pop fan can find a place in its heart for the erratic motions of a band as in love with music as this one.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5236-all-is-dream/,V2,2001.0,"The year was 2001, and the iconic American rock band Mercury Rev was ready to unleash their sixth studio album upon the world. At that time, they had already established themselves as cult favorites with a unique sound that blended elements of psychedelic rock and dream pop. But with ""All Is Dream,"" they took things to a whole new level, creating a masterpiece that has stood the test of time.

For those who aren't familiar with Mercury Rev, let me fill you in. The band hails from Buffalo, New York, and was formed in 1989 by Jonathan Donahue (vocals, guitar) and Sean ""Grasshopper"" Mackowiak (guitar). Over the years, they've had a rotating cast of members come and go, but Donahue and Mackowiak have remained the driving force behind the group.

When it comes to ""All Is Dream,"" the album's creation story is actually quite interesting. Reportedly, it was recorded in an old church in upstate New York, giving the music a haunting, cathedral-like quality. According to the band, they wanted to create an album that felt like a dream, with surreal imagery and otherworldly sounds. And they certainly succeeded.

From the opening track ""The Dark is Rising"" to the closing notes of ""Hercules,"" ""All Is Dream"" is a journey through a dreamscape that's both beautiful and unsettling. Donahue's ethereal vocals float over a sea of lush instrumentation, with strings, horns, and electronics all blending together seamlessly. The songs are complex and multi-layered, with moments of pure beauty followed by bursts of chaos.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Nite and Fog,"" which features a sample of a speech by Martin Luther King Jr. layered over a haunting instrumental track. It's a powerful moment that serves as a reminder of the band's political leanings and their desire to use their music as a way to make a statement. 

As a personal fan of Mercury Rev and ""All Is Dream,"" I can't recommend this album enough. There's something truly magical about the way the music transports you to another world, and it's a testament to the band's talent and vision. 

While I wouldn't say this album is for everyone, especially those who prefer more straightforward rock songs, for those who are willing to dive into the dreamlike world of Mercury Rev, ""All Is Dream"" is an absolute treasure. I give it a rating of 8.5 out of 10, as it's a must-listen for any fan of psychedelic rock, dream pop, or experimental music in general.","1.

Blood Meridian,Kick Up the Dust,Rock,7.0,August 10 2006,Sam Ubl,,"I haven't read Blood Meridian, the novel by Cormac McCarthy, but it's said to be violent and western. Blood Meridian's Kick Up the Dust is plenty western, a little violent, and full of hardscrabble big-sky anthems captured in shimmering clarity. Smart money blows the whistle here: This is reference porn at its most full-frontal. What's more, McCarthy's grisly tale isn't even the only BM the band name channels. Lead singer/songwriter Matthew Camirand plays bass in Black Mountain, and you'll recognize that Vancouver band's noirish, dissociative stomp in this Vancouver band's noirish, dissociative gallop. The differences are subtle but they add up: Blood Meridian are more concise and more drinky than druggy. They take no interest in discursive instrumental passages, but they sure love tremolo guitar. Like Neil Young, Camirand writes laconic lyrics about personal struggle, but he doesn't have Young's humanist empathy. He's the simpler, shallower sort: a guy with a guitar and some problems. Narcissism has its musical advantages, though. Lacking worldly ambition, Camirand has an easier road to hoe. His music never sounds all that dogged or overburdened, the way it might if he possessed a more demanding conscience. His lyrics infuse the songs with a sense of resignation, a contented nihilism that prevents Kick Up the Dust from being moving or profound but keeps the album easygoing and fun throughout. The album doesn't score big points for originality-- ""Soldiers of Christ"" sounds like a million White Stripes songs, and not just in the vague sense that the bands share the same tradition-- but breaking new ground isn't the m.o. here. ""Kick Up the Dust"" overcomes its plodding predictability by sheer dint of sonics: Like most of the album, it's just so easy on the ears. A towering guitar slides in around the three-minute mark, sounding as sultry and soulful as anything on the Band of Horses record. Blood Meridian does most swimmingly when it truncates its songs. ""Work Hard, For What?"" lets a stutter-growling organ riff do its thing for a piece before arriving suddenly at a decisive conclusion: ""Take that job and shove it up your ass."" At 2:48, the only track that's shorter is opener ""Your Boyfriends' Blues"", which delivers verses in groups of three sentences yet somehow finds room for a beautiful bridge of banjo and twinkling tremolo guitar. But that doesn't mean you should bypass the longer tracks: ""Let It Come Down"" lays down six minutes of comfy, sun-bleached guitar spirals; I'd take a day lounging on such blissful shores.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9292-kick-up-the-dust/,V2,2006.0,"There's something about good old-fashioned rock and roll that can really get your blood pumping. And the album Kick Up the Dust by Blood Meridian is no exception. With their infectious hooks, gritty guitar riffs, and raw energy, this album is sure to get the party started.

For those of you unfamiliar with Blood Meridian, let me fill you in on the backstory. The band was formed back in 2006 in Brooklyn, New York, by songwriter and guitarist Joe Michelini. They quickly gained a following in the local music scene, with their unique blend of blues, punk, and classic rock influences.

Kick Up the Dust, released in 2013, is the band's third full-length album. And it's clear that they've really hit their stride with this one. From the opening track ""The Burning Shore"" to the album's closer ""Broken Teeth Blues,"" Blood Meridian lays down a non-stop barrage of hard-hitting, foot-stomping rock and roll.

One of the things that really stands out about this album is the guitar work. Michelini's riffs are sharp and precise, while his solos are soulful and soaring. And the rhythm section, comprised of bassist Dan Bindschedler and drummer Jeff Sojka, provides a solid foundation for the band's sound.

But while the music on this album is undeniably impressive, it's the lyrics that really grab you. Michelini writes with a raw honesty that's often missing from modern rock music. Whether he's singing about heartbreak, addiction, or just the highs and lows of everyday life, his words hit you right in the gut.

Personally, I've had Kick Up the Dust on repeat for the past few weeks. There's just something about the way this album makes me feel that keeps me coming back for more. Maybe it's the infectious melodies, or maybe it's the way Michelini's lyrics cut straight to the bone. Whatever it is, I can't get enough of it.

Now, if I had to nitpick, there are a few moments on this album where things feel a bit repetitive. But honestly, that's a small quibble in the grand scheme of things. Overall, Kick Up the Dust is a fantastic album that showcases Blood Meridian at the top of their game. If you're a fan of rock and roll, do yourself a favor and give this album a spin. You won't be disappointed.","1. Review A has a more complex sentence structure and uses more descriptive and elaborate language, while Review B uses simpler and more direct language.

Trevor de Brauw,Uptown,Rock,7.3,February 10 2017,Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,"For almost 20 years, the guitarist Trevor de Brauw has anchored the stalwart instrumental rock band Pelican. His chiseled riffs, stretching skyward from a crust of doom metal toward the wide skies of post-rock, have long been its real hook. As prolific as that band has been, de Brauw has kept busy with a litany of side-projects, too, from his new trio RLYR to the slow-motion creep of the drone collective Chord. Still, as late as last summer, de Brauw confessed to a lack of confidence in his guitar prowess, doubtful even of his ability to reproduce songs onstage. Making music, he said, was an emotional and mental necessity, not some chance to flex his technical abilities. That compulsive approach is critical to Uptown, de Brauw’s solo debut. Instead of serving as a showcase, Uptown instead collects six open-ended, marvelously textured guitar instrumentals written during the last decade. Sure, there is a certain level of wizardry here, especially with guitar loops that wrap into Moebius strips of sound or the army of ways de Brauw warps the signals from his six strings. During the record’s tremendous finale, the twelve-minute beauty “From the Black Soil Poetry and Song Sprang,” de Brauw manages to conjure and control a symphony of guitars by himself. The piece suggests the choir-like calm of Rhys Chatham’s A Crimson Grail or Growing in its prime a decade ago. There’s sophistication, too, in the ways that de Brauw patiently peels layers apart or puts them together. “Distinct Frequency” is little more than three minutes of a powerful drone and a broadcast of what might be the evening news, pitted against one another. But de Brauw pulls them apart so slowly that the music is dramatic and demanding, as if always on the verge of some major revelation. But Uptown is a subtle record, and both signals just fade into silence. Indeed, the complexity and real delight of Uptown stem more from its commingled, nuanced emotions than its instrumental execution. These six songs are, alternately, messy webs of anxiety and comfort, frustration and hopefulness, fatigue and energy, together always pushing past simple binaries of happy or sad, light or dark. The deliberate chords of “They Keep Bowing,” for instance, seem at first caustic. But as they decay, they blossom into something beautiful, with individual notes suddenly circling above like halos. Likewise, “Turn Up for What” (who said solo guitar records couldn’t have a sense of humor?) transitions from chimes and bells into a loud electric groan into, finally, a riff that aims for liftoff. The boundary between each phase is fuzzy, implying that each state is linked to the others. Like the intertwined loops and nested layers, there are no discrete or easy feelings to Uptown. It is, de Brauw says without a word, complicated. The world of solo guitar records isn’t really the domain of urgent, timely statements. They are, more often, practiced steps on a continuum, sometimes speaking only to like-minded practitioners and listeners. Despite its long gestation, though, Uptown feels surprisingly necessary and somehow reassuring. There’s confusion and clarity within these songs, an understanding that these ideas and emotions only make sense in the presence of each other. During Uptown, the darkest parts sometimes allow for flickers of light, though other times the darkness swallows the light whole. It is an apt soundtrack for the start of 2017, then, when signs of pending apocalypse and revolution seem to bleed into one.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22855-uptown/,Flenser,2017.0,"Trevor de Brauw's 'Uptown' is a quintessential rock album that blends intricate guitar work with a melancholic, introspective atmosphere. As someone who has been a fan of de Brauw's work for years, I was eager to hear how he would approach his first solo release. If you're unfamiliar with de Brauw's musical background, he's best known as the guitarist for the experimental rock band Pelican, which has been a prominent figure in heavy music for over a decade.

The creation story behind 'Uptown' is a fascinating one. According to de Brauw himself, the album was inspired by a period of personal upheaval and loss in his life, leading him to channel his emotions into music. What resulted was an album that represents a stark shift away from the overpowering rock sound of Pelican and towards a more delicate, intimate sound. As a longtime fan of Pelican, I was admittedly apprehensive about this change, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well de Brauw pulled it off.

The album kicks off with the song 'A New Architecture,' which sets the tone for the rest of the record with its moody guitar noodling and slow-building intensity. The album's lead single, 'They Keep Bowing,' is another standout track that features a hypnotic riff and some of de Brauw's most intricate guitar work. The song 'A Single Blade of Grass' is another highlight, with its cascading guitar lines and haunting melody that lingers in your mind long after the song has ended.

One particular aspect that I love about this record is its flawless pacing - the songs ebb and flow with a natural ease, creating a cohesive listening experience that feels both contemplative and emotionally resonant. It's clear that de Brauw put a lot of thought into the order of the tracks, and it pays off in spades.

Overall, I would highly recommend 'Uptown' to any fan of rock music. While it might be a departure from de Brauw's previous work with Pelican, it stands on its own as a unique and captivating record that showcases his versatility as a musician. I'm excited to see where he goes from here, as this album has only left me eager for more. With a rating of 7.3 out of 10, it's not quite perfect, but it's a testament to the quality of the music that even without being a perfect masterpiece, it still manages to be an excellent record that will satisfy any discerning music fan.","1.

Red Red Meat,There's a Star Above the Manger Tonight,Rock,8.0,January 15 2015,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Chicago’s Red Red Meat, led by Tim Rutili and including members he would carry on into his next band, Califone, were active in the fringes of alternative rock throughout the 1990s. They were one of the few groups that did something different with the basic tools of what was then called grunge. Red Red Meat were on Sub Pop and they toured with hometown friends Smashing Pumpkins, but they were one of those indie bands that never really had a chance at the big time. They were too insular, too weird, they didn’t look very interesting on camera. But they made four fine records and the last of these, 1997’s There’s a Star Above the Manger Tonight, has been lovingly reissued. This wasn’t Red Red Meat’s best record—that honor goes to its predecessor, 1995’s Bunny Gets Paid, which gets over purely on the strength of its songwriting. Almost every cut on Bunny still sounds like a bent rock classic. Star Above the Manger, on the other hand, is an album about sound, the place where Red Red Meat fully discovered the studio-as-instrument. One of the reasons the music press loved so much of '90s alternative rock is because it was heard as moving ""back to the basics"": loud guitars, heavy drums, and a singer howling in torment. From one angle, it was a conservative movement. Red Red Meat provided an interesting twist on this template with an intent focus on technology. Based in Chicago in the '90s, Red Red Meat were well aware of what bands in what would eventually come to be called post-rock were doing. The ideas of manipulating a gnarly guitar riff with a computer and snapping beats to a grid were not out of the question. All of those ideas came into full flower on Star Above the Manger. For as much crunchy, blues-based riffing as is going on here, Star feels like it’s happening inside of a computer. The band themselves were drawing inspiration from Teo Macero’s work with Miles Davis, seeing how fragments of live jamming could be altered and re-edited into something new. The result is an album that, even now, 18 years later, still sounds remarkably fresh and like little else. The ultra-stiff drums on ""Chinese Balls"" are one example among many of what makes this record unusual: on one level, it sounds like a Stones-y rock song, with trebly chords and slide guitar, but the rhythmic undercurrent is pure Man-Machine, even though the individual drum hits sound ""live."" The title track smashes old against new in a different but still intriguing way, with a violin and banjo that are all pinched midrange, bringing to mind the thin response of a 78 that might wind up on The Anthology of American Folk Music. But the layered voices and particulars of the mix sound thoroughly contemporary, with small details that would have never occurred to someone hearing music before the advent of multi-track. On ""Second Hand Sea"", one of the most beautiful ballads Tim Rutili has written, the banjo is midrange-heavy and in an unusual tuning, sounding more like a Chinese qinqin, and it traces the delicate melody as bassy throbs of percussion crash like waves on a shore, while the instrumental ""Paul Pachal"" moves from tense surges of guitar and malleted drums to something approaching pure noise music. You can never quite tell where you are inside this album—depression-era blues, early-'70s arena rock, downtown post-punk, early laptop era—and all the sounds and techniques swirl together, resulting in something beautifully disorienting. For the reissue, boutique label Jealous Butcher have commissioned a new cover by John Herndon of Tortoise, pressed the records on bright orange vinyl, and have also included a variation on the song-specific artwork (also by Herndon) included with the original release. The latter is an especially nice touch, as the projects of Red Red Meat and their various offshoots always had the aura of the found object, that feeling when you confront something interesting without all the necessary context and figure out the story by working backwards. The bonus tracks, the usual assortment of outtakes, flesh out the story, and demonstrate that this was indeed a fertile period of exploration for the band. The highlight among them is the version of ""Welcome Christmas"", the B-side on the title track’s 7''. It’s a version of the song sung in Whoville during the climactic scene of How The Grinch Stole Christmas. Between this cover and the one of ""There’s Always Tomorrow"", from ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"", off Bunny, Red Red Meat out themselves as a band with a sentimental streak about the holiday season, not unlike that of fellow travelers the Flaming Lips, another group that did something strange and compelling within the confines of '90s alt rock. Red Red Meat never had a chance to be anywhere near that huge and probably would have blown it if they had, but their records hold up as well as any of the bands they were lumped with.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19948-theres-a-star-above-the-manger-tonight/,"Jealous Butcher,Jealous Butcher",1997.0,"""There's a Star Above the Manger Tonight"" is a rock album by Red Red Meat, and it is an absolutely remarkable work of art.

Jessica Bailiff,Jessica Bailiff,Rock,7.3,February 10 2003,Chris Dahlen,,"This could have been tear-makingly dull: Droning textural music under one woman's ethereal voice, all caught in gauze-like overdubs, each one softer than last. Plus, it was recorded at home, which can often pull an album down from ""slowcore"" to ""nubby gray pajamacore."" But while Jessica Bailiff's third record relies heavily on atmosphere, the sharp execution makes it work: With good songs and inventive arrangements, she made the album taut and precise, turning simple elements into well-realized mood pieces. Plus, her voice is beautiful. Restrained and almost expressionlessly consistent, it shimmers whether laid flat over an acoustic guitar or treated to sound far off, like... well, if you've ever had the ghost of a young girl stuck in your plumbing, you'll know what I'm talking about. Bailiff's words help with the spooking, too, with lines like, ""I heard you creeping under the bed,"" or the eerie way she floats the word, ""disappear."" The mood of this record doesn't waver, but the arrangements keep things interesting. After recording her first two albums with assistance from Low, Bailiff made this one with her Red Morning Chorus bandmates, Jesse Edwards and Noel Keesee, providing unspecified help on the instruments that buzz, drone and beat behind her voice. They provide enough variety between the songs without overwhelming any one track: Each one comes out stark and minimal. Take ""Hour of the Traces"" (the title of which, curiously, is a variation on the title of her previous full-length), which starts with low handdrums playing a rhythm that echoes Native American music. Gradually, she adds piercing long notes from a ""violin-uke"" (a weird, bowed tabletop instrument that arcs over her chanting vocals), and an almost-subliminal, serpentine bass guitar to wind underneath. ""Disappear"" takes a similar beat but adds an electric drone, possibly from a guitar, and on ""Big Hill"" a string-like sound pans and vibrates slowly around her voice like a bug. The droning may not work for all listeners-- you might get a little round-eyed when she sings a dazed, one-note melody throughout ""You Were So Close"". But it's not all dust bowls and dry chills: The first track, ""Swallowed"", splurges on a piano and ringing strummed guitar. It even has a hummable melody, as does ""Mary"", the liveliest of her mournful dirges. This album can't avoid the dilemma where it may be too foggy for some listeners, yet without so much focus we couldn't dig so deeply into the wide plains and dead, gnarled tree roots of Bailiff's head. She solves the problem better than most with the edgy instrumentation, not to mention that voice, which, with or without effects, is captivating. With this release, Bailiff has made her first deeply intimate and intriguingly rendered full-length. With any luck, it gets even better from here.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/533-jessica-bailiff/,Kranky,2002.0,"Jessica Bailiff's self-titled album is an impressive piece of rock music. As an independent artist, Bailiff has taken great strides in establishing herself as a noteworthy musician, and this album is a testament to her talents.

Beginning as a member of the band Clear Horizon, a part of the Bloomington, Indiana music scene of the 1990s, Bailiff moved on to a successful solo career in the following years. The music on this album is a testament to her experiences and struggles as an artist growing within the framework of the local music scene.

Each of the fourteen tracks on the album serves to display Bailiff's creativity and dedication to her craft. From the slow, brooding guitar of ""One Red Year,"" to the upbeat and poppy ""Sugarcoat,"" there is a consistency in the quality of the music throughout the album.

One of the most noteworthy tracks is ""Crush,"" which is a true stand-out piece. The acoustic guitar work is impressive, and the lyrics are both haunting and touching. Bailiff's voice on this track is dynamic and soulful, drawing the listener into the emotion of the song.

Overall, the sound on this album is immersive and lush, with layers of guitar and other instruments all blending together to create a dreamy soundscape. It is a unique and effective approach that helps make this album stand out from other rock albums.

Despite being an independent artist, Bailiff has managed to create a thoroughly professional and polished album. The self-titled record is a testament to her abilities as both a musician and songwriter. While one can sense the nostalgia and longing funnelling through her music, it never overshadows the always present joy and spirit in her work.

Mates of State,You're Going to Make It EP,Rock,3.9,June 15 2015,Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"It’s been four years since Mates of State released their sixth and most recent album, Mountaintops, but it feels like it’s been a lot longer. During that span of time, the scattered scene they once represented has only receded even further into the past, leaving them unmoored—out of time at best, irrelevant at worst. A decade ago Jason Hammel and Kori Gardner were one of so many co-ed power-pop duos competing for that cold ""O.C."" cash: Georgie James out of D.C., the Rosebuds out of North Carolina, the Like Young from Chicago, Viva Voce from way out in Portland. Most of them were romantically entangled; all of them got by more on energy than on actual hooks. Few were quite so early to the scene as Mates of State, who hooked up in 1997 and started a band shortly after. At first, they were drums (Hammel) and organ (Gardner), but soon they expanded into synths and programmed beats, even the occasional guitar—all without losing their default setting of aggressively cute. That adaptability might have been their saving grace, as Mates soldiered on while others stumbled. On one hand, they were on the fringe of a postmillennial movement loosely known as ""joycore,"" which tried to make pop exuberance sound radical, if not quite radicalized. But Mates of State made Architecture in Helsinki and the Go! Team sound like the Fall and Wire by comparison, perhaps because their primary subject wasn’t the world around them but the world they made together. Listeners were either charmed or chagrined by the moony eyes they made at each other onstage. Even if they never enjoyed much mainstream success beyond the occasional television soundtrack placement, you can hear their influence in the DIY pop of Karmin and the Ting Tings, which is not the most enviable legacy. The tone of this review might sound like an obituary, but Mates of State are far from dead. ""Staring Contest"", the first track on their comeback EP You’re Going to Make It, almost makes a case for this type of precocious blisspop, with its cheeky burbles of synths, its roughhousing-with-the-kids drums, and the intimate interplay between Hammel and Gardner’s vocals. ""I used to be wild!"" they exclaim to each other. ""I’m wild about you!"" The best thing about the song is that they don’t sound like they’re lamenting their mutual domestication, but celebrating it. They’d rather be tamed. On the very next song, however, they sound too tame—old and curmudgeonly even. ""Beautiful Kids"" is one of those songs that rails against the youngs and their selfie sticks and social medias while bemoaning the death of magazines and stuff. ""You’re always staring into cracked scenes,"" they accuse. ""You should stare into my eyes more."" They build a bridge out of dial tones and cash registers: ""you go click click click…"" It’s one of the most embarrassing musical passages of the year. By comparison, ""I Want to Run"" and ""Gonna Get It"" both play it safe, risking little by relying on that pop ebullience that comes suspiciously easy to them. Domesticity is one of the great undersung subjects in pop music. The immensity and excitement of new love has inspired countless tunes since forever, and the devastation and misery of dead love has inspired even more. But there are far fewer songs about love that endure and flourish from one comfortable day to the next, through anniversaries and birthdays, through kids and mortgages, through all the hard work that makes a marriage work. You’re Going to Make It makes life sound like one big bouncy castle of fun, and that unquestioned contentment renders Mates of State musically anonymous. By the time Gardner bares her soul on closer ""Sides of Boxes"", the gravity of the situation—her realization that her daughters will grow up and eventually leave—sounds incongruous and disjointed. ""It’s like a cannonball went through our home, you are almost fully grown,"" she sings as the song fades poignantly. It sounds like the start of a compelling album, not the end of an inert EP.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20645-youre-going-to-make-it-ep/,"Barsuk,Fierce Panda",2015.0,"If you're looking for some new rock music to add to your playlist, you might want to take a chance on Mates of State's EP, ""You're Going to Make It."" With a 3.9 rating out of 10, this album might not be the obvious choice, but that would be a mistake. Mates of State, who hail from Lawrence, Kansas, have been producing music together since 1997, so they're no strangers to the scene.

The duo, consisting of husband and wife team Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel, have created an album that showcases their well-honed musical abilities. The EP consists of four tracks, ""Staring Contest,"" ""Beautiful Kids,"" ""Gonna Get It,"" and ""How I Run."" Each song blends rock with elements of pop and electronic music, creating a unique sound that is both innovative and easy to listen to.

The album's creation story is one of collaboration and passion. Gardner and Hammel spent months writing and recording the songs in their home studio, experimenting with different sounds and instrumentation until they found the perfect balance. The result is an EP that is polished and well-crafted, yet retains a sense of raw energy that makes it feel authentic and real.

When listening to ""You're Going to Make It,"" one can't help but be drawn in by the captivating vocals of both Gardner and Hammel. Their harmonies are tight and their chemistry is palpable, making each song feel like a conversation between two old friends. The lyrics are introspective and honest, with themes of perseverance and self-discovery woven throughout.

Personally, I was blown away by the emotional depth of ""Gonna Get It"" and the catchy hooks of ""Beautiful Kids."" I found myself humming the latter for days after my first listen. Each song seemed to blend into the next, creating a cohesive narrative that left me feeling fulfilled yet craving more.

In conclusion, Mates of State's ""You're Going to Make It"" is a beautifully crafted album that showcases the duo's musical talents and passion for their craft. With catchy hooks, captivating harmonies, and introspective lyrics, this EP is definitely worth a listen. Don't let the 3.9 rating fool you – this is a gem of an album that deserves to be heard.","1.

Sam Shalabi,On Hashish,Rock,6.4,April 3 2002,Mark Richard-San,,"A quick glance at this album cover might make the long-time Pitchfork reader yearn for the skewed-but-effective prose of Mr. James Wisdom, but the title does not, in fact, refer to the mindset of its construction. As detailed on the inside cover of the album, On Hashish is an homage to German cultural theorist Walter Benjamin, who worked on a book bearing the same title, which remained unfinished at the time of his death in 1940. Shalabi's On Hashish would probably make lousy drug music for anyone but the most daring, anyway, because this album is packed with dense, unsettling passages of sound likely to trigger a bad freakout in even the most seasoned psychedelic traveler. It's been creeping me out, even though I've been sober as a judge every time I've heard it. Shalabi's method for this record was to record instrumental passages by some of his favorite Montreal musicians (including bassist Alexandre St. Onge from the Shalabi Effect, and Thierry Amar and Norslola Johnson from Godspeed You Black Emperor!) and then completely rearrange the recordings into an abstract soundfield that owes something to musique concrÃ¨te. As would be expected given the circumstances surrounding its creation, On Hashish is a more difficult listen than the more band-oriented affairs of the Shalabi Effect, and winds up being closer in spirit to last year's satisfying collaboration Kristian, Shalabi, St. Onge. The centerpiece of On Hashish is the 26-minute opener ""Outside Chance (Dreamfangs)."" Whether or not the title was meant as a pun, it seems plausible that chance indeed played a role in the track's composition. The beginning section consists of cymbal splashes that sound like a glass endlessly shattering in extreme slow motion, random piano tinkles, some distant vocalizations, and periodic bows from the double-bass of St. Onge. A couple minutes of indeterminate percussion form a bridge to the next section, a thick cluster of flute tones organized to sound like otherworldly sobs. Stabs of noise, probably emanating from instruments being manipulated in non-traditional ways, punctuate this moving passage. From there, the piece incorporates assorted field recordings and coasts out on a deep, rumbling drone and some analog glitches. An air of ceremony pervades the effective ""Outside Chance (Dreamfangs),"" giving it the quality of mourning music from another dimension. ""Soot"" begins with a collective free-jazzy blast of reeds and horns, and then modulates into a disturbing bit of drone music anchored around a constantly wavering and badly distorted sine wave tone. The electronics continue to do battle with the swirl of the horns as other noises fold in, lending a Cageian air of chaos. An abrupt cut leads to ""The Wherewithal,"" a nearly eight-minute piece cooped mostly of hiss, chirps, static and subsonic rumbles, which manages to be comforting despite its noisy surface, almost like a sleep-inducing wall of pink noise. While passages of ""Outside Chance (Dreamfangs)"" are undeniably powerful, ""The Wherewithal"" has a truly odd tranquility, and ""Soot"" is impressively abrasive, something keeps me from labeling On Hashish as a great album. Part of my problem is that it's difficult to imagine the mood that would compel me to pull the record from the shelf-- but there's something else missing. These long, abstract pieces are definitely meant to be heard in a single sitting, but the album as a whole never quite congeals. The pacing seems slightly off, with some stretches that degenerate into tedium, and, ""Soot"" aside, there isn't a lot of dynamic range. Still, there are more than enough riveting passages here to demand attention from Shalabi admirers, and one has to marvel at the consistently high level of the man's prolific output.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7093-on-hashish/,Alien8,2002.0,"If you're a rock music enthusiast, you might want to consider adding Sam Shalabi's 'On Hashish' to your playlist. With a rating of 6.4 out of 10, this album might not be everyone's cup of tea; however, it's worth a listen for those who appreciate the unconventional and experimental side of rock music.

Sam Shalabi is a composer, musician, and improviser from Montreal, Canada, who has been blending various genres of music since the late 1990s. He has played with several bands, including the Shalabi Effect, Molasses, and Land of Kush. For 'On Hashish,' Shalabi worked alongside some of Montreal's finest musicians, including Jesse Levine, Alexandre St-Onge, and Stefan Schneider, among others.

The album's creation story is an intriguing one. Shalabi composed the songs on 'On Hashish' after consuming hashish, which explains the album's dreamy and psychedelic nature. It's evident from the album's opening track, 'On Hashish Part 1,' that this is not your typical rock music. The track starts with a mesmerizing Oud riff, followed by percussion and a distorted guitar, which sets the tone for what's to come.

Throughout the album's eight tracks, Shalabi and his bandmates take the listener on a musical journey that explores various textures, melodies, and rhythms. Songs like 'Momentum' and 'On Hashish Part 2' feature hypnotic guitar riffs and psychedelic soundscapes that transport the listener to another dimension. 'Bride of the Zar' is another standout track; it starts with a haunting Oud melody and gradually builds into a wild, free-form jam.

Personally, I found 'On Hashish' to be a refreshing departure from the typical rock music I listen to. The album is not an easy listen, and one might need to consume hashish (or a similar substance) to fully appreciate it. However, there's something undeniably captivating about Shalabi's experimental approach to rock music. 

In conclusion, 'On Hashish' is not for everyone, but it's a must-listen for fans of experimental rock music. It's an album that rewards the listener with each listen, revealing new layers and textures that might have been missed before. Sam Shalabi and his bandmates show great skill and passion on this album, and I'm excited to see what they come up with next.","1.

Tobias Thomas,"Please, Please, Please",,6.8,June 18 2007,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"Judging by how long it takes a Tobias Thomas mix to get up and running, you'd expect him to be more tortoise than man; it's a good 10 minutes and three scratchy ambient tracks before Thomas drops the beat on Please ,Please, Please, his third mix disc for Kompakt. Actually, it might be longer, since I'm not sure if ""vinyl crackle plus bass pulse"" really counts as a beat. Thomas' extended intros are nearly all atmosphere and ambient drift because he's serving notice on anyone who comes to his mixes looking for a little Saturday night fever. Thomas is keenly aware that a mix CD should operate on its own-- in this case more intimate-- terms. Please, Please, Please is an object made by one friend for another, rather than by a DJ looking to make 1,000 friends on the dancefloor. Thomas gets so intimate, in fact, that he almost climbs into your inner ear. The opening of PPP takes the deliquescing church bells of Pantha Du Prince's ""Butterfly Girl (Pantha Lost the Beat Version)"" and the freefalling piano chords of Adolf ""DJ Koze"" Noise's ""Was Ist Zuviel Zeit? (Dub)"" and slides them across the big black headspace a good pair of headphones can create. His taste in beats tends towards the timbral/melodic as well; it's five tracks and a good 20 minutes before the recognizably jacking house boom-tick of Johannes Heil's ""Aquarius"" finally pokes its head above the surface of Thomas' aqueous mix, rippling like a lake under moonlight. The first half of PPP sounds like it should only be played around 4 a.m. at just-audible volume. As PPP progresses, starting with the starved tribal house bongos and emaciated handclaps of Ricardo Villalobos' ""The Contempt (Trip Tollsmix)"" at the halfway mark, it picks up the pace with a string of beefy, if ultimately interchangeable, mid-tempo bangers, a slight capitulation to the fact that Thomas is supposed to be making a ""dance"" mix. This muscular middle peaks with the Detroit techno hi-hats and bouncy ball electro bassline of Reinhard Voigt's ""Suchtkultur"". And then, after an almost entirely instrumental hour, a charming (if cheesy) vocoder-hiccup cover of the Smiths' ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"" by Brant featuring Mr. Roper sets up two leftfield diva tunes to close us out. The baby's rattle electro beats of International Pony's ""Gravity"" are strung between tingly cartoon harp runs and keyboard trills coated with major label gloss, as the Pony playfully pitches up the kittenish female singer until she's as screechy as that Dan Deacon album. Thomas and Geiger's own remix of Stella's cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" (follow all that?) mixes up live instruments (you can hear the frets squeaking), competent vocals (though hardly Nicks-ian), and a spacey New Order breakdown that then ditches the electric bass and jazzy drums for a spot-on early '90s techno pastiche. Like the rest of PPP, ultimately less of a state-of-the-nation dance mix than an idiosyncratic diversion, its inclusion is a sign that, though Thomas' mixing skills mean the disc flows smoothly, his ear for selection remains tuned to a very private channel.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10323-please-please-please/,Kompakt,2007.0,"The world of music is vast and diverse, and sometimes it's a real treat to stumble upon an artist that stands out from the crowd. For me, that artist is Tobias Thomas and his album 'Please, Please, Please'. This album is a masterpiece of the nan genre and has a rating of 6.8 out of 10.

First things first, let's talk about the band's history. Tobias Thomas is a German DJ and producer, deeply entrenched in the music scene since the early 90s. Having worked with a plethora of musicians, Thomas has earned himself a reputation as a tastemaker known for his impeccable style and unique sound. With 'Please, Please, Please', he continues to push the boundaries of the genre and showcase his impressive production skills.

But let's talk about the album itself. It's a beautiful sonic journey that takes you through an array of emotions. The tracks are layered with intricate melodies and rhythms that gradually build and fall, creating a dynamic landscape of sound. This album is a perfect example of the power of music when it's created from the heart. The tracks unfold with such depth and feeling that you can't help but be drawn in, immersed in the world of the music.

My personal favorite track on the album is 'The Beach'. The ethereal soundscape transports you to a calm, peaceful place where you can lose yourself in the music. The build-up of the track is truly a beautiful thing to experience, the subtle layering of sounds creating a feeling of wonder and awe.

Another track that deserves a mention is 'Easter Sunday'. The deep bassline is complemented by the haunting vocals and percussion, creating an otherworldly atmosphere. This track has a unique energy that is both captivating and intriguing.

In terms of production, the album is immaculate. Thomas has crafted an album that is both intimate and expansive, with every element of the tracks working in harmony to create a cohesive whole. The attention to detail is impressive, with every sound and effect placed perfectly to serve the overall sound of the album.

In conclusion, 'Please, Please, Please' is a true gem of an album. Tobias Thomas has created something truly special here, an album that showcases the power and beauty of music created from a place of passion and heart. Whether you're a fan of the nan genre or not, I would highly recommend this album to anyone who appreciates great music.","1.

Charlie Puth,Nine Track Mind,Pop/R&B,2.5,February 3 2016,Jia Tolentino,Contributor,"There are 12 tracks on Charlie Puth’s debut album Nine Track Mind, which is either three or 12 too many. But no matter; the album is a smoothly executed pitch deck of exactly what will perform on pop radio in 2016, and Puth—pronounced ""Pooth,"" and the slice through his right eyebrow is from a childhood canine attack, if you’re wondering—will do just fine. The 24-year-old Berklee College of Music graduate and former YouTube star of the acoustic-cover variety has already had three top 40 singles, all since last February: first, the demonic Meghan Trainor duet ""Marvin Gaye,"" then, the Paul Walker Memorial Beanie Baby track ""See You Again"" (featuring Wiz Khalifa), then ""One Call Away,"" an ocean of syrup that sounds exactly like ""See You Again,"" and is the first song on the LP. Charlie Puth is extremely talented, it must be said. There’s that Berklee degree, of course, and the fact that he wrote so many theme songs for famous vloggers before he signed to Atlantic. Puth co-wrote every song on Nine Track Mind and produced much of it solo, and the songwriting and the arrangements and the engineering are shockingly proficient, proficient to the point of insensation. Also, there is Puth’s voice, a beautiful tenor/falsetto soaring out of a throat that never coughs that frog out and as such must be magical. In other words, Charlie Puth is a truly excellent product, the type of artist that inspires wildly confident emails from anyone getting a cut. ""Wrote the hook in 10 minutes,"" you can imagine his A&R tapping out on an iPhone (Puth did, he says, for ""See You Again""). ""Video’s going to be just Paul Walker clips and the Wiz verse, guaranteed smash, gonna do a billion on YouTube."" And it did. Like the best-selling (i.e. blandest) model home in the up-and-coming suburb, Nine Track Mind is demoralizingly well-constructed as a means to an end, and it’s because of Puth’s considerable abilities, and not in spite of them, that the album induces such despair. It doesn’t help that Nine Track Mind is all ballads except for three tracks, two of which are duets (Trainor, a sleepy Selena Gomez) that somehow still feel like ballads. Puth cannot fill this frame of sentimentality with any genuine sentiment: The album’s emotional range covers the spectrum from light longing to light infatuation, contributing to the overall sense that Nine Track Mind is aimed exclusively at hairlessness: children, prepubescents, the discomfitingly waxed. As he showed us in ""Marvin Gaye,"" Puth lives for retro flourishes: doo-wop rhythms, sock-hop melodies, finger snaps, arpeggiated singalong piano. The album doesn’t deviate much from this safe spot; when it does, it goes blander (""Up All Night"" is completely self-effacing) or, pleasantly, Ryan Tedder-er (""My Gospel"" is a nicely rumbling One Republic facsimile), or, even more pleasantly, somewhat close to Justin Timberlake territory. ""Suffer"" is a credibly lustful piece of pleading, and ""Losing My Mind"" begins with a lovely, distorted Timbaland-lite riff that rings like a bell over Puth, who gets to take a welcome break from his falsetto. The latter track sounds like the work of an award-winning college acapella group; it is the album’s strongest track. As for the rest? ""Left Right Left,"" a love-ish song that sounds like accidentally holding hands with a coworker, is a ballad that assumes no one will listen to it. If you did, you’d hear Charlie Puth encouraging his romantic interest—""We’re almost there, baby, one more step""—to bravely overcome the obstacle of Charlie Puth, who is dealing with a set of problems that includes ""walls,"" ""long roads,"" and ""climbing."" There is a classic track in the So Sweet The Neg Will Be Invisible genre (it’s called ""Then There’s You,"" and the chorus goes ""There’s beautiful and then there’s you""). There is also a series of increasingly unnecessary vows scattered throughout the album: Puth promises to save the day, to never sleep alone, to stay perfectly still when the world is on fire, and then, in ""My Gospel,"" he goes nuclear. ""I’d stroll into a bank and put a ski mask on and walk out with a million bucks,"" he blusters. ""Then I’d burn it in a pile out on your front lawn, just to prove it didn’t mean that much."" That lyric couplet has the approximate relationship to joy and meaning as the rest of this album does, generally. Later in the same track, Puth promises to ""carry your body to the top of the tower to kiss your lips at midnight."" What a tempting offer, and a typical one, in which your best case scenario is unconsciousness. You’d have to be completely sensible to pass.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21502-nine-track-mind/,Atlantic,2016.0,"Alright, folks. We're diving into the highly anticipated ""Nine Track Mind"" by powerhouse pop/R&B artist Charlie Puth, and let me tell you, I've got mixed emotions about this one. With a rating of 2.5 out of 10, it's safe to say that there are some flaws here. But before we get into all that, let's start with a little Charlie Puth history lesson.

Puth rose to fame in 2015 with his debut single ""Marvin Gaye"" featuring Meghan Trainor, followed by massive hits like ""One Call Away"" and ""We Don't Talk Anymore"" with Selena Gomez. He's written and produced for major artists like Wiz Khalifa and Katy Perry, and even nabbed three Grammy nominations for his work on the Furious 7 soundtrack. So needless to say, expectations were high for ""Nine Track Mind.""

Unfortunately, this album fell short. The biggest issue here is that it feels all too familiar. The lyrics are cliché and the instrumentals are generic, making it hard to distinguish one song from the next. There are a few standout tracks like ""Dangerously"" and ""We Don't Talk Anymore,"" but overall, it lacks innovation and creativity.

But I don't want to completely tear this album apart. There are moments of redeeming quality, like Puth's smooth and soulful vocals. It's clear that he's got some strong pipes on him, and I appreciate that he's really trying to deliver some emotional weight with his lyrics. However, the execution just falls flat.

As for my personal experience with ""Nine Track Mind,"" I have to admit that I was disappointed. I was really hoping for Puth to bring some fresh energy to the pop/R&B scene, but instead, I found myself skipping through tracks in search of something that stood out. That being said, I'm sure there are die-hard Charlie Puth fans who will love this album no matter what, and that's totally okay.

In conclusion, ""Nine Track Mind"" is a mixed bag. While there are a few noteworthy moments, it ultimately falls short of creating something truly special. If you're a casual listener, you might find a few tracks worth adding to your playlist, but if you're looking for the next big thing in pop/R&B, you might want to keep searching.","1.

Liars,Drum's Not Dead,Rock,9.0,February 22 2006,Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,"Ditching Berliniamsburg for the real deal, Liars moved to Germany in late 2004 to replant their roots in fresh cultural soil and begin recording their third album in a studio that offered creative possibilities too fertile to resist: The acoustically rich radio facility in the former East Germany boasts a labyrinthine system of rooms, each with its own distinct acoustic advantages. The trio's relocation is sure to be cited as the impetus for the Krautrock-like propulsivity of the resulting LP, but prior to the change of scenery they were exploring this kind of dark percussiveness on 2004's They Were Wrong, So We Drowned. Most listeners had shrugged that album off for its dissimilarity to the band's acclaimed dance-punk debut, They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top, but while hectic, less refined, and at times sloppy, the underrated They Were Wrong marked the shift in direction that would lead Liars to the ethereal gorgeousness of Drum's Not Dead. Highlighted by taut improvisation and frontman Angus Andrew's mastery of falsetto, the record's resolute seamlessness may be attributable to growth through practice: Liars wrote and recorded one album, but, not wholly satisfied with the results, decided against releasing it. Instead, that material was used as a blueprint for what became Drum's Not Dead, and in the process, the band cast off They Were Wrong's witches and Walpurgisnacht. Granted, there is still a conceptual libretto, this time centered on the universal struggle between confidence and cowardice. These traits are represented by two characters: the instinctive and assertive Drum, and the pessimistic, apprehensive Mt. Heart Attack. Of course, as with They Were Wrong, any conceptual devices remain secondary to the sound and mood. ""Be Quiet Mt. Heart Attack!"" perfectly sets the stage, as fractured guitar waves, opiate military percussion, and Andrew's windswept vocals careen into pitch-shifts which slightly deepen the shadows. Segueing into ""Let's Not Wrestle Mt. Heart Attack"", Liars let forth a siren call that bears an uncanny resemblance to the first few seconds of Faust's ""The Sad Skinhead"", then plunge into bubbling floor-tom/cymbal madness that echoes both Liquid Liquid and This Heat. The percussion is corporeal, tapping into some inner biological timepiece, and as on the album's best tracks, guitar notes are employed only as simple pulsing behind layered, seraphic vocals. Completing the mood-setting opening triad, ""A Visit From Drum"" is linked again by a vocal gasp; a less treated kit accompanies a floor tom/snare and the clattering of sticks for a creepy, mystic sounding incantation. Here and elsewhere, the guitar is an ambient sidekick to high-pitched vocals and tribal drumming. Those first three songs are the album's strongest grouping, yet the excellent push/pull sequencing of Drum's Not Dead creates a shivery cumulative effect that spans the entire length of the record: By its closing notes, you're likely to find yourself awed and emotionally spent. ""Drum Gets a Glimpse"" pairs a mournful Eno-esque melodic sense with cymbal washes, M83 guitar tones, crickets, and Andrew trading lines between the naive and melancholy falsetto of Mt. Heart Attack (""It seems like all our friends have gone""), and the deeper, more authoritative Drum (""You drove them out""). Later, there are a couple of abstract pieces-- fuzzier, looping canyon bliss-outs with left-channel acoustic guitar; a bit of swirling, Sister-era Sonic Youth shredding-- along with a pair of standouts. The first of these, ""Drum and the Uncomfortable Can"", is coated in reverb that amplifies the intensity of the cannibalistic double drumming: It's primal marching band music wrapped in guitar feedback and a howling voice singing about hiding a body. The second comes with the straightforward, closing ballad ""The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack"", which resolves the album at its-- and the band's-- absolute peak. Like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Maps"", its surprise sentimentality lends essential emotional weight, but does so with a dedicated restraint. Gentle guitar drifts accrue density alongside sighing vocals, warmed tom tom heartbeats, tiny instrumental accents (piano, tambourine, roughed-up strings), and Andrew's simple, sweet sentiments: ""I won't run far, I can always be found""; ""If you want me to stay, I will stay by your side."" For added value, Liars flesh things out with an accompanying DVD that presents three visual versions of the album: ""Drum's Not Bread"" by drummer Julian Gross, ""The Helix Aspersa"" by Andrew, and filmmaker Markus Wambsganss' ""By Your Side"". Due to its liberal use of live and studio footage (and farm animals, actually), Gross' best held my attention. More refined, Wambsganss creates effects with light and motion-- his three-channel video for ""The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack"" is his portion's most compelling moment. Maintaining a stoic minimalism, Andrew fixates on a snail's ponderous adventures through Germany. Of course, the music remains the greatest draw. Those who previously yearned for a career trajectory the band wisely ditched ought to listen to Drum and keep track of the epiphanies. In the coming weeks, its strengths will win converts, even among those who'd previously jumped ship. But my favorite detail of this feel-good story-- popular Brooklyn post-punk band falls out of favor by changing directions and ultimately produces an album that eclipses its debut-- is that Liars are still waltzing along on their own terms. This, their third LP, shows zero concessions to the criticisms they received from publications like Spin and Rolling Stone, who awarded They Were Wrong their lowest possible marks. Succeeding rather than regressing or retreating, Liars have had the last laugh: Drum's Not Dead is a majestic victory lap, and on all levels, a total fucking triumph. ",1,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4767-drums-not-dead/,Mute,2006.0,"Liars is a band that needs no introduction to those who love post-rock and experimental music. Their album Drum's Not Dead is an absolute masterpiece that represents the highest level of creativity and talent that this genre of music can achieve.

Born in 2000 in Brooklyn, Liars has spent two decades pushing the boundaries in alternative rock, art rock, and experimental genres. Their third album, Drum's Not Dead, released in 2006, is a fascinating exploration of sounds, rhythm, and emotion. It all began during a period of creative blockage for the band. They realized they needed to hit the reset button and redefine the way they approached making music.

The band's lead vocalist and bassist, Angus Andrew, and drummer Aaron Hemphill, began to experiment with different styles and approaches in a quest for a new sound. They abandoned traditional forms and embraced the freedom to create something unexpected. They integrated tribal beats along with electronic soundscapes, using instruments that include drums, vibraphones, and guitars.

The result of this experimentation is Drum's Not Dead, an album that defies traditional musical genres in favor of creating something truly unique. It's a haunting soundscape of tribal beats, electronic soundscapes, and raw emotion that's hard to put into words. The album's two parts, ""Drum"" and ""Mt. Heart Attack,"" each with six tracks, create something that's powerful and emotionally charged.

As someone who grew up listening to traditional rock music, Drum's Not Dead was a revelation to me. The album is an auditory experience that doesn't simply rely on traditional song structure. The tracks aren't confined to catchy choruses or verses. Instead, they offer something more complex and rewarding, with sounds that ebb and flow and evolve over time. ""Cycle Time"" and ""It Fit When I Was A Kid"" demonstrate Liars ability to create a remarkable tension in their music, with raw emotional vocals and a thumping drumbeat.

Drum's Not Dead is an album that's perfect for anyone who enjoys challenging, unconventional music. It's an auditory journey that will leave you exhilarated and emotionally charged. The album is a testament to the creative power that lies in pushing past boundaries and embracing the freedom to experiment. From the fascinating instrumentation to the raw emotion express throughout, Drum's Not Dead is a remarkable achievement in the world of experimental music, deserving of every bit of its 9.0 rating.","Step-by-step reasoning:

Air,Pocket Symphony,Electronic,6.6,March 7 2007,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Air like to let you know what kind of album you're in for with the first couple of bars of their opening tracks. Moon Safari faded up with bongos on ""La Femme D'Argent"", setting the stage for a loose and hep journey into space-age atmospherics. The ""do-do-thWACK"" S&M whip of the drum machine opening to ""Electronic Performers"", on the other hand, thrust us into the stiffer, shinier, more adventurous world of 10,000 Hz Legend, wherein Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel sounded as if they'd been inhaling some of Dean and Gene Ween's Scotchgard. Talkie Walkie broke the percussion-only trend by pairing its opening beat with a strummed acoustic guitar and a stately piano refrain, introducing their warmest, brightest, and most song-oriented album. And on Pocket Symphony, the opening message is equally clear: The fluttering percussion on ""Space Maker"", hovering all alone, sounds like it's bouncing off hard, cold surfaces. Which would seem to suggest that this will be Air's quietest and most austere offering. And so it is. There's a remarkable confidence on display here, that Air would choose to have their first album in three years be so spacious and moody, and so much less pop. They must know that they'll lose a few come-lately fans with music this relaxed and, well, sleepy. But the more you listen to Pocket Symphony, the more it becomes clear that it's remote by design. As they demonstrated throughout Talkie Walkie and on a few tracks per record on the previous two, Air can very capably write terrifically catchy songs when so inclined; here, they'd rather create finely-wrought furniture music. And they're good at it. Working again with Nigel Godrich, they've crafted what might be one of the year's best-sounding records, every lone piano note hanging improbably long in space and aloud to decay in what must be some unimaginably beautiful room. My first instinct was that Pocket Symphony was the return to Moon Safari territory fans wanted so desperately when 10,000 Hz Legend first hit the shelves, but upon returning to their debut for the first time in a good while, that seems off. Yes, there's a quality to Godin's heavenly basslines that occasionally puts this record in a similar groovy headspace, but Air are light years from the earlier work's cheeky retro-futurisms. In the formal world of Pocket Symphony, a squelchy Moog would be considered vulgar, the unpredictability of its aged circuits no substitute for the absolute control of a grand piano, a finely brushed acoustic guitar, or the Japanese koto. Air are ready to unplug here at a moment's notice, and the space in which these acoustic instruments was recorded counts as an instrument in itself. Four of these dozen tracks are purely instrumental, but the ratio feels higher-- many of the poppier songs seem to be about arrangement and shading first. Jarvis Cocker chips in on ""One Hell of a Party"", his husky, downcast voice suiting the song's metaphor (relationship as hedonistic soiree to be reckoned with the morning after), and yet the frame of the song is so skeletal that the sentiment never gathers weight. This might seem to mirror the bombed-out nature of the lyric, but that's an intellectualization; it's ultimately just an OK, verging-on-dull song. Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy sings lead on ""Somewhere Between Walking and Sleeping"" and the result-- muted, vaguely bland-- is again just serviceable. The pop songs that Dunckel sings are better suited to the album's frame of mind, serving more as sketches, the sort of half-written catchphrases that exist, in the ""Kelly Watch the Stars"" sense, mostly to build a chord structure around. The creamy layers of voice during the ""without you"" chorus in ""Left Bank"", along with the upbeat ""Mer du Japon""-- one of the best songs they've written and the album's best track-- are as close as Air get to Talkie Walkie­-level hooks. Elsewhere, it's more subtle hints and raised eyebrows than fleshed-out songs, whether the prickly synth and robotic swing of ""Napalm Love"" with its three-note melody or the crisp, lightly echoed spaciousness of ""Photograph"", which clicks along like patent leather boots down a dark marble hallway. On every pass through the record, it seems clearer that the sound of Pocket Symphony is the album's real content. And that sound, no question, is exquisite. But it's also hard to hold in your head after the record stops playing, so Pocket Symphony winds up feeling strangely transient, accomplished and genuinely likeable but also forgettable.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9975-pocket-symphony/,Astralwerks,2007.0,"If you're a fan of electronic music, you've likely heard of Air, the pioneering French duo that has been in the game for well over two decades. With a sound that evolved from ambient to trip-hop to synth-pop and beyond, each Air album has its own unique flavor while retaining the unmistakable mark of the group's signature style. The release of their fifth studio album, Pocket Symphony, in 2007 was no different.

At the time, Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel decided to ditch the use of conventional drums and instead embraced unconventional percussion sounds that incorporated traditional Japanese instruments like the koto and shamisen. This departure from their previous sonic palette offered the duo a new direction and the result was a record that felt more meditative, introspective, and minimalistic than their earlier work.

From the opening track ""Space Maker,"" the listener is immediately transported to a world of vintage synths, airy vocals, and lush, expansive soundscapes. ""Once Upon a Time"" builds on this sound, featuring dreamy melodies and a gentle beat that feels like drifting on a tide-current. The use of the Chinese guzheng in both ""Redhead Girl"" and ""Mer du Japon"" is a welcome touch that adds a layer of culture and depth to the album. 

For the more upbeat tracks on the album, Air relies on their electric guitars, as heard in ""Left Bank"" and ""Napalm Love."" Although these songs provide a welcome energy boost, they don't quite reach the same heights as the more introspective tracks that dominate Pocket Symphony. 

It's hard not to marvel at the production genius that Air brings to their music. They seem to strike the perfect balance between creating a sense of atmosphere and letting the melodies take center stage. While the album does at times feel monotonous, this is part of the beauty of the album since it makes for an effective score for introspective reflection or background music for creative endeavors.

As someone who appreciates the work of Air, I feel that Pocket Symphony stands out from the rest of their discography in many ways. There is a certain quiet reflection that permeates every track and it is easy to lose oneself in the gentleness of the melodies. While the album is not perfect, it still stands as a thoughtful and unique departure from their more traditional electronic offerings. I give the album a solid 7 out of 10, perfect for fans of ambient, trip-hop and down-tempo genres.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed, while Review B is more concise.

The Gaslight Anthem,American Slang,Rock,7.3,June 16 2010,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"Where so many young rock bands struggle to liberate themselves from the tyranny of influence, the Gaslight Anthem simply embrace it. Every album, every song, every lyric makes some overt musical or lyrical reference to the New Jersey greasers' working-class heroes-- Bruce Springsteen, Joe Strummer, Tom Petty. And while there ain't a lick of jazz in their music, the Gaslight Anthem give their songs names like ""The Spirit of Jazz"" and ""Miles Davis & the Cool"" and ""The '59 Sound"" in an attempt to recapture some bygone, ineffable standard of hipness that can only be gleaned by staring at old Blue Note album covers. Like Arcade Fire before them, they've also graduated from being mere Springsteen fans to becoming the Boss' onstage duet partners, and on their new album, American Slang, the Gaslight Anthem even try their hand at reggae riddims, because, well, Joe would've wanted it that way. But the Gaslight Anthem are not a band simply awash in nostalgia; their songs are about the very concept of nostalgia. And most importantly, they understand that nostalgia is not a lens through which we fondly reminiscence about the past, but a gauge by which we evaluate our troubled present. On American Slang, the follow-up to the Gaslight Anthem's 2008 triumph The '59 Sound, frontman Brian Fallon is utterly consumed by the idea that his best days are behind him-- three songs contain a variation on the dewy-eyed phrase ""when we/you were young,"" and on another, he seemingly gets frustrated with his own backward-glancing impulses, angrily demanding, ""Don't sing me the songs about the good times/ Those days are gone and you should just let them go."" So in this sense, the Gaslight Anthem's Springsteen/Strummer worship is less about idolatry and mimicry than a defense mechanism against a modern world that's presented them with no new heroes to aspire to. For about half of American Slang, the Gaslight Anthem simply barrel ahead like they're making The '60 Sound, with briskly paced rockers like ""Stay Lucky"", ""Orphans"", and ""The Spirit of Jazz"" nudging the band's blue-collar punk towards Replacements-vintage power pop. But elsewhere, the prevailing quarterlife-crisis angst has a perceptible effect on the band's disposition-- where The '59 Sound burst out of the gates, American Slang moves forward in more measured spurts and, in pained power ballad ""We Did It When We Were Young"", it even momentarily succumbs to U2-itis (as earnest rock bands inevitably do). However, if mid-tempo stompers like the title track and ""Bring It On"" lack the do-or-die exhilaration of the band's best songs-- and rely too heavily on Fallon's strained, rust-covered pipes to deliver the necessary drama-- other attempts at downshifting successfully open up the band's sound. Where most Springsteen-swooned indie-rockers strive for *Born to Run-*scale grandeur, ""The Diamond Church Street Choir"" effectively opts for a cool ""Spirit in the Night"" sway over which Fallon, like Bruce in his Asbury Park days, offers up rich street-scene details and character portraits of the New Jersey neighborhood that birthed his band. And the aforementioned dub dalliance, ""The Queen of Lower Chelsea"", proves to be American Slang's emotional center, its skittering rhythm guiding Fallon's tragic-hero protagonist along her lonesome journey from New York to London, en route to the song's heroic chorus. Even if many of the album's lyrics find Fallon looking back in anger, American Slang ultimately proves The Gaslight Anthem are not afraid to move forward.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14355-american-slang/,SideOneDummy,2010.0,"The Gaslight Anthem's 'American Slang' is a rock album that truly embraces the essence of American music. As someone who appreciates music, especially rock, I had high expectations for this album. And it definitely lived up to the hype.

Firstly, let's talk about the band's history. The Gaslight Anthem is an American rock band formed in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 2006. They are known for their heartfelt lyrics and energetic performances that often reinterpret classic rock and roll sounds. 'American Slang' is their third studio album and was released in 2010. On this album, the band combined their punk and Americana influences to create a unique, yet familiar sound.

The creation story of this album is quite interesting. The band worked with producer Ted Hutt, who previously produced albums for bands such as Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphys. In an interview, lead singer Brian Fallon mentioned that he and the band wanted to make a rock album that sounded like The Clash, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, and Bruce Springsteen fused together. And that is exactly what they achieved.

From the very first track, ""American Slang,"" you can feel the energy and passion the band poured into this album. The title track's catchy guitar riffs and driving drums make it a perfect opening song. One of my personal favorites is ""The Queen of Lower Chelsea,"" an upbeat song with an infectious chorus that is certain to get stuck in your head.

The album also includes slower, more emotional tracks such as ""Boxer"" and ""We Did It When We Were Young."" These songs showcase Fallon's ability to write evocative lyrics that tell a story and resonate with listeners. His voice, raw and imperfect, adds to the authenticity of the album, making it feel like you're listening to a live performance rather than a studio recording.

Overall, The Gaslight Anthem's 'American Slang' is a well-crafted album that combines classic rock influences with modern punk sensibilities. It's an album that speaks to the American experience and the feeling of growing up in a small town. With a rating of 7.3 out of 10, I believe this album deserves higher recognition. It's an album that I keep coming back to because of its timeless quality and the emotional connection it creates with listeners. If you're a fan of rock music, 'American Slang' is an album you do not want to miss.","1.

The Nels Cline Singers,Instrumentals,"Experimental,Jazz",8.0,November 6 2002,Brendan Reid,,"Yeah, singers. Like Cher. Cher sings on this album. And Madonna. And Sting. In fact, everyone who only has one name, they all sing on this album. If you didn't fall for that, good for you. The recently assembled Nels Cline Singers are guitarist Nels Cline's current touring outfit featuring Devin Hoff on contrabass and Scott Amendola on drums/electronics. And Instrumentals, though issuing forth from the titanic loins of these so-called Singers, is as unsullied by human voice as the rest of guitarist Cline's non-rock work. While Nels spends his days axing for the Geraldine Fibbers, noodling with Thurston Moore, shopping for shoes with Mike Watt, etc., all he's ever really wanted to do was go home and toss back a can of that cold, frothy jazz. Of course, given his background, Cline's never been afraid of inflecting the idiom with ideas borrowed from the more remote quarters of the rock world (exotic pedals, dictatorial spaz-mandates, etc). That he does so without ever approaching ""fusion"" is to his enduring credit. While Instrumentals suffers a bit in comparison to Cline's previous studio work with the huge Destroy All Nels Cline ensemble, it's mostly because the three-piece lineup curtails some of the wild tonal exploration done on that record. Don't fret, though, these folks still have an awful lot going for them. They can be furiously tight, for one thing, when in rock-mode. ""Cause for Concern"" and ""Ghost of the PiÃ±ata"" both make for sublime chase music; the former spits convoluted back-alley riffs out from between clenched teeth, while the latter heat-shimmers with backwards reverb and crystalline arpeggios. ""Suspended Head"", dedicated in the liner notes to the awesome SF-based experimental art-rock band Deerhoof, comes off as an even more elastic, unhinged version of the same. In the presence of these tracks, the even more straightforward ""blues mutation"" ""Lowered Boom""-- a showcase for Hoff's menacing bow-work and Cline's rawhide chops-- even starts to sound a little lackluster. They more than make up for it, though, on the less structured pieces. The most immediately likable of these, the fifteen-minute ""Blood Drawing"", slowly churns a soup of Can-ish string squeals into a spacy, arabesque guitar workout. Though it's hard to tell who's doing what at times, it often seems like Amendola is the most interesting noisemaker of the group, stringing together drum loops on the fly and then letting them decay beyond recognition. On the ""freer"" pieces, ""A Mug Like Mine"" and ""Lucia"", it's Amendola too who acts as the loosest cannon, battering away wildly enough to give Cline and Hoff's follow-the-leader skronk the appearance of regularity. All right, you knew I was going to have to use ""skronk"" sooner or later (and dammit, you would have said it, too). Given the amount of it that's made it onto this record, though, the Singers' capacity for melody and delicacy is pretty remarkable. Cline's relatively spare figures, Hoff's sobbing vibrato, and Amendola's electronic manipulations on ""Harbor Child"" are all equally elegiac. The closer, ""Slipped Away""-- probably the most ""composed"" piece on the album-- is just as simply, sadly beautiful, pursuing the fundamental in slow-motion through a wasted chordal countryside. What's amazing is that this isn't really anything that new for Nels; the faces (and the warped musical personalities behind them) have changed, but it's mainly just another addition to a growing and worthwhile body of work.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1510-instrumentals/,Cryptogramophone,2002.0,"Have you ever heard a piece of music that transports you to a different dimension? That's how I felt when I first listened to 'Instrumentals', the latest album by The Nels Cline Singers. With elements of experimental and jazz music, the album is truly a masterpiece that deserves recognition.

The Nels Cline Singers, led by the Grammy-winning guitarist Nels Cline, have been setting their stamp on the music scene since the late 1990s. Their sound has always been distinctive, combining various genres into a unique sonic tapestry. The band's lineup has changed throughout the years, but current members Scott Amendola on drums and Trevor Dunn on bass have been with the group since 2002. The synergy between the three is palpable, and 'Instrumentals' showcases their musical chemistry in the best way possible.

The album was recorded in 2018, with the band members experimenting with various musical ideas and themes. The end result is an eclectic mix of sounds, ranging from the frenzied energy of ""Imperfect 10"" to the more ethereal ""The Nomad's Home"". The song titles themselves provide insight into the band's creative process - each one is based on a different concept or idea, with the music reflecting these themes in a visceral way.

Listening to 'Instrumentals' is an experience in itself. The music is complex and multi-layered, with each instrument weaving in and out of each other like a sonic tapestry. Nels' guitar playing is nothing short of astounding, his virtuosity shining through in every track. Dunn's bass provides a solid foundation, while Amendola's drumming is innovative and dynamic.

Personally, I was blown away by the album's opening track, ""Imperfect 10"". The frenzied energy of the song is infectious, with the guitar and drums playing off of each other in a way that makes you want to jump out of your seat and dance. On the other end of the spectrum, ""Blues, Too"" is a more contemplative, introspective track that features Nels' beautiful fingerpicking style.

Overall, 'Instrumentals' is a must-listen for anyone who appreciates innovative, experimental music that pushes boundaries. The Nels Cline Singers have created a sound that is truly their own, and this album serves as a testament to their musical prowess. I highly recommend giving it a listen - but be prepared to be taken on a wild, musical journey! I would rate this album a solid 8.0 out of 10.","1.

Jesu,Opiate Sun,"Metal,Rock",7.0,October 30 2009,Jess Harvell,Contributor,"The EP might be the ideal format for Justin Broadrick's music, regardless of his alias. Whether he's trying to erase your head via concrete-slab guitars in Napalm Death, reduce techno to a series of clockwork hammerblows with Final, or massage your pleasure centers with neo-shoegaze in Godflesh, Broadrick's music has a laudable singularity. The three-or-four-song dose mainlines his all-consuming mood of the moment without the potential dilution of trying to fill up a CD. Broadrick claims to be channeling his long-unused (or presumed non-existent) pop instincts via Jesu, and the band's DNA always has too much of hard rock's cathartic oomph and pop's peaks and valleys to pass for ambient. But Jesu's extended-players like Silver, Lifeline, and now Opiate Sun do seem to bring out Broadrick's more memorable riffs and choruses. If nothing else, they foreground those riffs and ringing climaxes in a way that the hour-plus ebb-and-flow of Jesu or Conqueror isn't designed to do. Opiate Sun isn't as good as the all-over bodiless sparkle of Lifeline, which may be the best non-collaborative release in Broadrick's unwieldy discography. It's more of a Jesu sampler, a four-song distillation of the band's major modes, with some of Broadrick's most accessible, ingratiating songwriting-- radio-ready if not for the tempos and the fuzz. ""Losing Streak"" and the title track are more or less arena alt-rock at a snail's pace, almost cuddly and triumphant enough to be a Foo Fighters single, or maybe Probot if Dave Grohl had drafted Kevin Shields instead of Lemmy. (Plus, I swear, a hint of slow-motion southern rock grandeur in ""Losing Streak""'s mid-song solo.) ""Deflated"" is one of those oxymorons Jesu do so well-- the angelic dirge-- with bass skirting doom metal while the guitar auditions for some early-1990s Creation Records A&R dude. ""Morning Light"" really is doom, the only out-and-out metal tune here, skewed only by Broadrick's multi-tracked sad-dude vox. Add it all up and (more or less) you've got Jesu. So Opiate Sun is both the most recent fix for Jesu addicts anxiously awaiting album nÃºmero tres, and an easy-access jump-on point for not-quite-yet-fans. Opiate Sun's heavy enough to act as gateway drug for those who still know Broadrick only as the guy behind Godflesh's decade-long bad day (if such creatures even exist). It will please the post-'gaze guitar-texture freaks who cream on contact with sonorous feedback. And it's memorable enough to hook those one-and-done consumers of the album-abjuring age. Not bad for four songs.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13600-opiate-sun/,Caldo Verde,2009.0,"If you're looking for a metal album with a little bit of rock influence to spice things up, then Jesu's 'Opiate Sun' might just be what you're looking for. This album is a solid effort from the band, earning a 7.0 out of 10 rating, and it's easy to see why.

Before getting into the actual music, it's worth taking a moment to appreciate Jesu's history. Jesu, the musical project of Justin Broadrick, has been around since 2003, and has undergone various transformations and collaborations over the years. Broadrick is most well-known for his work with the iconic Godflesh, and has a lengthy career in the metal scene. With that kind of musical background, it's no surprise that Jesu's music is heavy, riff-driven, and unabashedly dark.

Of course, the story behind 'Opiate Sun' is equally fascinating. The album was actually originally released in 2010 as an EP, and it wasn't until 2020 that a full-length version saw the light of day. According to Broadrick himself, the delay was due to both logistical and creative reasons. Regardless, the end result is an album that feels almost timeless - it would have fit just as well in 2010 as it does in 2021.

So, what about the actual music? 'Opiate Sun' is a heady mix of distorted guitar riffs, electronic beats, and ethereal vocals. Broadrick's voice is often layered and augmented with effects, giving the music a dreamlike quality. At times, the album veers into shoegaze territory, but it never loses its metal edge. It's a delicate balance, but Jesu manages to pull it off in a way that feels effortless.

One standout track on the album is 'Alone', which starts off with a slow, hypnotic rhythm before building to a massive wall of sound. The guitars are heavy but melodic, and the vocals drift in and out of focus. There's a sense of yearning in the lyrics that's echoed in the music, and it all comes together to create a powerful emotional experience.

Overall, 'Opiate Sun' is an album that rewards repeated listens. It's dark, heavy, and moody, but it's also beautiful in its own way. If you're a fan of metal and rock, but also appreciate some experimentation and innovation, then this album is definitely worth checking out.","1.

Grizzly Bear,Horn of Plenty,Rock,7.7,February 10 2005,Matthew Murphy,Contributor,"Considering their name, Brooklyn address, and penchant for lo-fi campfire serenades, there's a powerful temptation to put Grizzly Bear in the same pen as those other charismatic megafauna, the Animal Collective, and be finished zookeeping for the night. But Horn of Plenty proves that categorization would be neither fair nor accurate. The gentlemen of Grizzly Bear paw around in wholly distinct regions of gentle, nocturnal psych-folk, conjuring visions of an imagined bedroom collaboration between the Doug Yule-era Velvet Underground, Nick Drake, and a pajama-clad Pooh with his head jammed in a honey jar. Originally conceived by multi-talented singer-songwriter Edward Droste as solo demos, the recordings that became Horn of Plenty were later augmented by the additional vocals and instrumentation of Christopher Bear, and after hearing the off-handed cohesion of the duo's dreamy harmonies and their seemingly effortless musical interplay it's difficult to imagine these songs achieving such heights of hushed majesty in any other format. And the extra set of hands ensures the flow of enough fresh oxygen to allow the album to avoid complete descent into the troubled, myopic solitude of such similarly toned homespun constructions as Skip Spence's Oar or Syd Barrett's The Madcap Laughs. The album opens with the appropriately submerged sounds of ""Deep Sea Diver"", which gradually climbs through currents of chiming, bell-like keys and guitars before finally surfacing into golden falsetto rays of sunlight. ""Disappearing Act"" marries its autumnal folk choruses to gauzy smears of vinyl hiss, handbells, and remote martial snares, while the clattering pocket symphony of ""Showcase"" eventually dissolves into the wordless vocalizing of felines on distant fire escapes. On nearly every track a previously unheard element, such as the mournful violin that shivers up the spine of ""Eavesdropping"", makes a brief spectral appearance before once again vanishing, leaving the listener to wonder at what hidden treasures further scrutiny might unearth. Given the heady depth of Horn of Plenty's hazy musical swoon, Grizzly Bear's lyrics somewhat surprisingly strike a pleasant counterbalance by residing more often than not in the familiar realm of day-to-day reality. It's not unusual to hear Droste and Bear singing relatively mundane pronouncements like ""My chest hurts a lot tonight"" or ""It's amazing I can still sing this song so simply about you,"" with such matter-of-fact nonchalance that as a result these songs collectively sound as unforced and natural as a series of quiet exhalations, capable of transferring the beguiling, intoxicating atmospheres of Grizzly Bear's bedroom directly into your own.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3666-horn-of-plenty/,Kanine,2004.0,"Let me start this review by saying that I have been a Grizzly Bear fan for years.

See, originally, it wasn't even supposed to be a Grizzly Bear album – it was just a solo project by the band's frontman, Ed Droste. But after some collaboration with his bandmates, that solo project grew into something much bigger. And what we ended up with was a stunningly crafted album that showcases the band's unique melding of acoustic and electronic elements.

One of the things I love about this album is how it manages to balance experimentation with accessibility. Yes, there are plenty of moments where the band gets weird with their instrumentation and song structures. But at the same time, they never lose sight of the beauty and emotion that can be found in a more straightforward melody. Tracks like ""Deep Sea Diver"" and ""Fix It"" are perfect examples of this – they're both catchy as hell, but they also have these intricate, layered arrangements that keep me coming back for more.

Of course, there are also plenty of moments on ""Horn of Plenty"" where Grizzly Bear completely goes off the rails. ""Eavesdropping"" is a prime example – it starts off as a mellow, acoustic ballad before exploding into this cacophonous, almost tribal-sounding chorus. It's intense and exhilarating, and definitely not the kind of thing you'd expect to hear from most rock bands.

Overall, though, I would say that ""Horn of Plenty"" is a solid debut album from a band that was clearly already onto something special. While it may not be their most polished or refined work, there's something undeniably charming about the raw energy and creativity on display here. And for longtime Grizzly Bear fans like myself, it's a fascinating glimpse into the band's early days and the seeds of their future greatness. I would give this album a solid 7.7 out of 10 – definitely not perfect, but definitely worth a listen.","1.

Venetian Snares,Huge Chrome Cylinder Box Unfolding,Electronic,7.9,August 15 2004,Liam Singer,,"A great schism has gradually formed in the orthodox church of the glitch and IDM scene. Of one doctrine is the Matmos/Oval/Mouse on Mars school, based around clicks, squelches and skips, in which musicians struggle to merge our fleshy, imperfect world with that of bent circuitry and drum machines. On the other side are those such as Autechre and Richard Devine, who program crystal-clear computer assaults directly into the listener's brain, with no patience for human warmth or error. While the first are an elusive breed of rarefied souls with mild artistic aspirations, the second are the kids who once survived on Mortal Kombat, Jolt Cola, and Dune, all grown up and ready to overload your conscious mind. And if, at the moment, electro-acoustician Fennesz and musique-concrete practitioners The Books are at one end of the scale, Canada's Aaron Funk (aka Venetian Snares) is providing the counterbalance. Venetian Snares' slightly menacing persona, drill 'n' bass onslaughts, and use of pizzicato string melodies all add up to, yes, a strong affinity with godfather Aphex Twin. But aurally, Venetian Snares equally occupies the soundscape of Autechre, creating mathematical spaces of sleek synth tones that show no trace of human intervention. This is more apparent than ever on Huge Chrome Cylinder Box Unfolding, Venetian Snares' second LP release this year following The Chocolate Wheelchair Album. Focused and consistent, Cylinder Box accentuates Venetian Snares' most accessible side. It's relatively gentle and melodic, and takes few forays into the abstract. Here, he's created his most sterile universe-- the computer generated spaceships pictured on the insert belie an environment lacking in the real voices or acoustic interludes that have occasionally humanized his quantized breakbeats in the past. The untouchable machinery of the album almost positions it as a piece of pure sound sculpture, but for the numerous complex beats and catchy melodies that keep it engaging. The drums veer away from the snare-heavy sound on which Funk built his reputation, to more metallic tones and sci-fi laser effects. The stereo panning in ""Ion Divoy"" is an especially memorable piece of production, and ""Vida"" is a standout track, ending in a cannon of pixelated bells and smooth syncopated pulsing. ""LI2CO3"" is another surprisingly pretty one, nearly Venetian Snares-lite. But there's still plenty of hardcore Funk present, and subtle pieces of scattered candy for the attentive listener. The album's fault lies in its lack of overall variation, which makes it nearly impossible to take in one sitting, despite the predictable ambient breaks. Funk's other recent release, Horse and Goat is a six-song EP inspired by its own cover art, which features-- in an attempt to shock the burgeoning soccer mom IDM listenership-- a Trevor Brown painting of a naked little girl helplessly surrounded by mutated children's-turned-sex toys. It's to be assumed by the ringtone modulated child's voice in the title track, and the deconstructed speak 'n' spells elsewhere (also present on Cylinder Box) that Funk is trying to say something about society's perversion of childhood; then again, it's hard to read too much into the work of a man whose stated goal is to make music that's ""fucked up."" Regardless, Horse and Goat is both more abstract and varied than Cylinder Box, but also less appealing. There are excellent parts, for sure: The title track is catchy and freaky, while the atmospherics of ""Lithium Twatting"" echo the dense computerverses of dark ambient artist Kim Cascone. But Horse and Goat passes by without really leaving an impact, and as much as we'd all love to proudly display it on our mantles, it may not be worth the $2 per song a U.S. resident must put toward ownership. By the time you finish reading this, Aaron Funk will have most likely released at least three more albums under two different pseudonyms. It's hard to say whether this level of output devalues the music, or stands as a testament to the man's work ethic (from interviews, it sounds as though he does little else). His position as among the most talented in his ultra-specialized field is unquestionable, his capacity for self-quality-control less so. But Huge Chrome Cylinder Box Unfolding is a good exercise in focused atmospherics, with beats that'll carry you along their lucid logic for as long as you're able to follow.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11859-huge-chrome-cylinder-box-unfoldinghorse-and-goat/,"Planet µ,Planet µ",2004.0,"If you're looking for a truly unique listening experience, Venetian Snares' ""Huge Chrome Cylinder Box Unfolding"" is definitely worth checking out. With roots in breakcore and electronic music, the project of Canadian producer Aaron Funk has built a reputation for pushing the boundaries of sound.

Taking a deep dive into this album, it's clear that Venetian Snares' sound is heavily influenced by the experimental electronic sounds of Aphex Twin and Squarepusher, but it manages to take these influences and twist them in new and engaging ways. The opening track, ""Deep Dicking,"" sets the tone for the album - with its heavy percussion and manic breakbeats, it feels like a sonic assault on the senses in the best possible way.

Despite the seemingly chaotic nature of the album, it's clear that a lot of thought and planning went into its creation. As Funk himself put it in a recent interview, ""I wanted the music to sound like every track was made on a different planet."" Indeed, each track on this album feels like a journey into a different world, with its own unique set of sounds and textures.

One of the standout tracks on the album, for me, is ""Poo Yourself Jason."" It starts off with a delicate piano melody, before launching into a frenzied beat that gradually builds in intensity. As the track progresses, layers of glitchy sound effects are added in, creating a dizzying and exhilarating listening experience.

Overall, I'd say that ""Huge Chrome Cylinder Box Unfolding"" is not for the faint of heart. It's a challenging listen, but one that rewards repeated listens and close attention. For fans of experimental electronic music, and for those looking for something truly out there, this album is a must-listen. Venetian Snares have created something truly special here, and I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next.","1.

Leila,"Blood, Looms and Blooms",Electronic,8.0,October 1 2008,Mia Clarke,,"When Warp signed the London-based Iranian DJ, musician, and producer Leila Arab to their already impressive roster, it was a smart choice for a label that has always successfully supported progressive electronic music with pop sensibilities. Leila's third album, Blood, Looms and Blooms, fits this theme well while retaining an individuality that sets it apart from its contemporaries. Featuring collaborations with notable vocalists, such as former Tricky partner Martina Topley-Bird and Specials frontman Terry Hall, this album fuses the personalities of its varied guests with an adventurous palette of sound. The combination lifts the music off familiar ground, revealing Leila as an artist unafraid to take risks that tug her further from the popular radar than would be the case if she chose to take a less-challenging path. It is the exquisite attention to the possibility, behavior, and character of sound that makes Blood, Looms and Blooms an accomplished piece of work. Leila's years of experience as a live DJ and programmer (she has recorded music on Aphex Twin's label and done live re-mixing and engineering for Björk, as well as supporting her with a DJ slot earlier this year) really come into play here. Every single noise, no matter how small in the mix, appears to be heavily treated and subjected to radical EQ-ing-- taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the Logic computer program she favors. These far-reaching, assured explorations of sound are particularly breathtaking on the album's first single, ""Mettle"", which is also one of the few exclusively instrumental tracks. The dark mood and layered rhythmic sparring is uncannily reminiscent of fellow label mate Flying Lotus, and weaves a sample of a dripping faucet that has been sequenced to sound like a beat into the tough fibres of other pleasingly combative lower frequencies. Another highlight is ""Daisies, Cats and Spacemen"", where Leila's sister, Roya Arab, provides striking vocals and lyrics, which are weighted with imagery of ancient cities and ""filthy footmarks reflecting tear-filled skies."" Blood, Looms And Blooms manages to feel strikingly singular despite being such a patchwork of different personalities, from the Beck-like indie feel of ""Little Acorns"" to the IDM-influenced ""Carplos"" to the uplifting accessibility of ""Deflect"". It's fitting that Leila's magical realism-evoking press photographs play on a Frida Kahlo-meets-crazed inventor concept. With this album she has created an experiment of enormous sonic range and openness-- at 14 tracks this leaves a lot of room in which to expand, yet the sound never strays from its essential logic and reveals something new at every turn. Leila herself has suggested that her ability to weld together so many ideas-- which may well come across as cluttered under the influence of someone else's ear and imagination-- could have been influenced by her initial refugee status upon in the UK with her family, following the Iranian revolution of 1979. In a recent interview she reflected on this idea, ""I realised very early on that people don't really belong anywhere. That's what gives me the freedom to do any kind of music...I don't feel any commitment or loyalty to anything. My commitment is to noise.""",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12270-blood-looms-and-blooms/,Warp,2008.0,"Electronic music has come a long way since its inception in the 80s, and some of the most innovative sounds in the genre today come from London-based artist Leila. Her album, ""Blood, Looms and Blooms,"" is a tour-de-force of eclectic sounds that push the boundaries of what electronic music can be.

Leila has been a fixture on the electronic music scene for over two decades now, and ""Blood, Looms and Blooms"" is a testament to her longevity and continued creativity. The album was released in 2008 and features a star-studded lineup of guest artists, including Martina Topley-Bird, Terry Hall, and Luca Santucci.

The creation story of this album is fascinating, as Leila recorded all the tracks in her bedroom on an old 4-track cassette recorder. The lo-fi production adds a raw quality to the music that's refreshing in a genre often defined by polished, overproduced sounds. It's clear that Leila's goal was to capture a feeling of intimacy and rawness, and she succeeds spectacularly.

As you listen to ""Blood, Looms and Blooms,"" you're transported to a world of swirling, dreamlike sounds that pulse with energy and life. The opening track, ""Mollie,"" sets the tone with its lush, expansive soundscape that gradually becomes more frenetic and churning as the track progresses.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Daisies, Cats, and Spacemen,"" which features haunting vocals from Terry Hall. The song builds slowly, layering intricate textures over a driving beat until it explodes into a flurry of sound that's both cathartic and thrilling.

One thing that struck me about this album was its sense of experimentation and willingness to take risks. It's clear that Leila was pushing herself creatively with each track, trying out new sounds and textures that defy easy categorization. This is electronic music that's not content to rest on its laurels, but continually evolves and surprises.

In terms of personal experience and opinion, I found ""Blood, Looms and Blooms"" to be a deeply immersive and rewarding listening experience. The music is bold and adventurous, and it rewards close attention with its intricate details and subtle shifts in sound. Moreover, its raw, intimate production gives it a timeless quality that I found really moving.

Overall, I would highly recommend the album to anyone who's a fan of electronic music or just looking for something new and exciting to listen to. It's a stunning achievement by a visionary artist who continues to blur the lines between genres and push the envelope of what's possible in electronic music. With a rating of 8.0 out of 10, ""Blood, Looms and Blooms"" is a must-listen for anyone looking for fresh and daring sounds in the electronic music world.","1.

Juliana Hatfield,Pussycat,Rock,6.8,May 1 2017,Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,"It was supposed to be the moment Donald Trump lost the election. Republicans bolted by the dozens, rescinding their endorsements and calling for him to drop out. Paul Ryan uninvited him to a rally. His own party chairman denounced him, and even Mike Pence, perhaps the most unwavering of all of Trump apologists, seemed to tease the possibility of turning on his running mate. And then somehow, with remarkable speed, the news cycle moved on. Within just a few weeks, the press seemed to completely forget about that unprecedented video of a presidential candidate admitting to—graphically bragging about—serial sexual assault. That voters were able to look past Trump’s “Access Hollywood” confessions remains astounding to Juliana Hatfield, who wrote of how deeply she was shaken by them in an essay for Talkhouse. “Since the Trump ‘pussy grab’ tapes were released, I’ve found myself wanting to reach for my emergency supply of valium,” the veteran alt-rocker wrote, describing what she dubbed “the Trump effect”: “The sight of his face and/or the sound of his voice tightens the stomach, the heart, the sphincter. Everything’s clenched. Even—maybe especially—the ‘pussy.’” Trump’s comments hang heavy over Hatfield’s latest record, Pussycat, an album packed with scathing vignettes about predatory men, particularly the one currently leading the free world. “I Wanna Be Your Disease” opens the record with fantasies of smiting the President, bringing him to his knees and making him pay for all his “vile and hateful words.” Heated as that track is, it’s tame compared to some of what follows. Few records this year have cried out quite so loudly for a trigger warning. On the queasy “When You’re a Star,” Hatfield connects Trump’s words to Bill Cosby’s sexual assaults. “She won’t remember a thing, and even if she did the law is on your side,” she sings, “They never prosecute your kind.” The sex in “Rhinoceros” is more consensual but no less graphic. Over a whimsically nasty riff, Hatfield imagines the horror of what intercourse with her husband might be like for Melania Trump. She spares no grotesque detail: the stench of rotting meat, the slobbering of his thick tongue, the hopelessness of feeling crushed under his mass (she likens it to being water boarded). Pussycat isn’t above some cheap shots—“Short-Fingered Man” pries at one of the President’s most legendary insecurities—but Hatfield’s lyrics nail the gut-level revulsion the President provokes in many women, especially those who’ve been victimized by powerful men. Apparently she wrote and recorded the album in a flurry of inspiration right after the election, playing everything but the drums herself, and that impulsivity often shows. Like much of the country last November, she was still working through her shock, straightening out her thoughts, and giving herself the freedom to follow them when they turned ugly. And yet, as loaded as the subject matter is, it does amazingly little to diminish Hatfield’s bright spirit. Even on this, her angriest record by a landslide, the singer retains the intrinsic tunefulness that’s marked every record she’s made since she was a teenager. Three decades after her debut with Blake Babies, her voice remains perpetually youthful, and her guitars continue to default to an agreeable jangle whenever she doesn’t make a concerted effort to toughen them up a bit. It’s difficult to imagine anybody else coming across quite so good-natured when singing about lighting Kellyanne Conway on fire and watching her face melt off. Ironically, Pussycat is the kind of bluntly political record Hatfield used to be knocked for shying away from. At the height of her 1990s stardom, Hatfield was dismissed in the more activist corners of the music world as a lightweight (never mind that her songs frequently explored the ways society needles and dismisses women). She’s spent her career in an often thankless middle ground, too feminine for the masculine music press, yet not punk enough for the riot grrls. But Pussycat lends to the case for a critical reappraisal. Now would be an ideal time for one, given how the DNA of Hatfield’s hooky, plainspoken alterna-pop has carried through some of indie-rock’s sharpest young songwriters, from Waxahatchee to Bully to Laura Stevenson and Charly Bliss—artists that have demonstrated there’s plenty of substance in this sound. What a treat it would be if, 30 years into their careers, they were all making records as relevant, passionate, and strangely personable as this one.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23223-pussycat/,American Laundromat,2017.0,"Juliana Hatfield's latest album, ""Pussycat"", is a rock masterpiece that showcases her incredible musicianship and songwriting skills. As a long-time fan of Hatfield's work, I was excited to hear what she had in store for us with this album, and I must say, I was not disappointed.

First, a brief history of the artist. Juliana Hatfield is a Boston-based musician who first gained recognition in the 1990s with her band, The Juliana Hatfield Three. Since then, she has released a slew of solo albums, as well as collaborations with other artists such as the indie rock supergroup Minor Alps. She is known for her distinctive vocals and her ability to write catchy, guitar-driven rock songs.

""Pussycat"" was born out of Hatfield's frustration with the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election. The album is a direct response to the misogyny and racism that Hatfield saw in the political landscape, and it doesn't hold back. The lyrics are biting, angry, and at times, downright heartbreaking. It's clear that Hatfield put her heart and soul into this album, and that passion is evident in every note.

From the opening track, ""I Wanna Be Your Disease"", it's clear that this is not going to be a typical rock album. The song is heavy and distorted, with Hatfield's voice floating above the chaos like a beacon of strength. It's an incredible introduction to the album, and it sets the tone for what's to come.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Touch You Again"". It's a slower, more introspective song than some of the others, and it showcases Hatfield's ability to write beautiful, heartfelt lyrics. The chorus, in particular, is incredibly moving: ""If I could touch you again, I would take all the pain away"". It's clear that this is a personal song for Hatfield, and it's one that will stay with me long after the album has ended.

Overall, ""Pussycat"" is a powerful, important album that deserves to be heard. Juliana Hatfield is a masterful musician and songwriter, and this album is a testament to her talent. If you're a fan of rock music, or if you're someone who needs to hear songs of strength and empowerment in these troubled times, I highly recommend giving ""Pussycat"" a listen. It's a 6.8 out of 10 rating might not do it complete justice in my opinion, but then again you'll have to listen to it and be the judge yourself.","1.

Songs: Ohia,Howler EP,Rock,5.0,July 10 2001,Ryan Kearney,,"Recently, the flagship of Dave Eggers' growing literary empire, McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, took the interesting step of tapping They Might Be Giants to compose music inspired by the magazine's content, a CD of which they included in each copy. The people at Absalom Recordings have taken this a step further by eliminating all that unnecessary ironic print, leaving us with a subscription-based series of EPs by independent musicians. Songs: Ohia's Howler is the first issue, as it were, to be followed every other month by the Czars, Howe Gelb, the Baptist Generals, Johnny Dowd and Calexico. The one-track, 3"" disc comes in a square cardboard gatefold sleeve the size of a beer coaster. But you probably wouldn't want to use it as such, since the cover is an eerie print of a creepy, Edvard Munch-inspired face that would probably freak you out after a couple of drinks. The music tries to do the same, but even the best horror movies lose their edge after multiple viewings. Having heard last year's haunting Ghost Tropic, this EP ceases to raise my blood pressure. ""Howler"" is likewise spare and very, er... patient, but the song lacks authenticity. It sounds as though singer/songwriter Jason Molina has kept the same songwriting technique from his last full-length, but has relocated from deep within a tribal rainforest to the back of a deserted toy store in Albuquerque, New Mexico. That line would be a reference to the cheap, one-note toy synthesizer bursts that provide the song's backbone. And the baby that giggles two-thirds of the way through the 13-minute track. The rest is the same: a distant, reverberated guitar and Will Oldham's-- I mean, Jason Molina's broken, lonesome voice. Impossible to love, and impossible to hate, ""Howler"" is interesting only for the concept behind it.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7335-howler-ep/,"Absalom,Absalom",,"Greetings music enthusiasts, today I would like to delve into the mesmerizing world of rock, specifically the Howler EP by Songs: Ohia. It’s always intriguing to discover new music gems that grab you by the soul and leave you in a trance, and this album is one of those gems.

Before we discuss the music, let's take a peek into the backstory of Songs: Ohia. The band was first formed in Chicago over two decades ago, with Jason Molina as the frontman. Molina had a sagacious talent for songwriting, and as the band gained a following, their experimental rock sound continued to captivate fans.

Now, let's delve into Howler EP, the band's final work which was released in 1996. This album gave a peek into the future of folk rock, and it’s no wonder that it is still celebrated today.

The first track on the album, “Howler”, which shares the name with the EP, is a beautiful and gentle melody, featuring Molina's soulful vocals while backed by a range of acoustic and electric guitar tunes. It’s intriguing how the track starts off mellow and slow, before erupting into a full-on guitar solo at the end. “Song for John In D"" followed next, which is a slow track, with Molina wistfully singing the lyrics alongside harmonica and some mildly psychedelic sounds reminiscent of the 60s.

“Soul"" is another song on the album that is sure to capture the listener's attention. It carries the same aesthetical guitar rhythm as the title track but is also laced with lyrical themes that are deep but relatable. The final track on the album is “United or Lost Alone"", which is an excellent work with the amalgamation of guitar riffs and instrumentation that complement each other perfectly. 

As someone who has been a fan of the band for a while, it’s hard to be objective, but I will try my best. Howler EP is a strong representation of what made Songs: Ohia unique. Even though the band had not quite attained the level of mainstream success that they deserved, they still packed a punch musically with this album. The band's experimental rock sound and Molina's poetic lyrics are truly unparalleled. 

As for the rating of 5.0 out of 10, I must humbly disagree. While the EP might not be for everyone, I believe it deserves a little more credit than that. The album is a well-crafted work of emotive art, and it's easy to get lost in the depths of the music. 

All in all, Howler EP by Songs: Ohia is an extremely satisfying listen. If you're a fan of folk rock, poetic lyrics, and experimental sounds with a touch of soul, then this album will not disappoint.","1.

Maja Ratkje,Adventura Anatomica,"Experimental,Jazz,Rock",7.8,January 5 2007,Brian Howe,Contributor,"Adventura Anatomica documents a live performance by Norwegian singer, composer, and sound artist Maja Ratkje. On a minimally appointed stage with dancers and hanging, two-dimensional birdlike constructions, Ratkje used a homemade sampling tool called ImproSculpt, harmonica, flute, some metal objects, and a vast array of vocal and bodily noises to craft this abstruse yet engrossing sound collage. I'm rushing through these preliminary details because they have little to do with the actual experience of listening to this record. By the fourth track, Adventura Anatomica seals you in so completely that it nearly blots out everything but the music itself, including the details of its creation. This isn't to say that what Ratkje does here lacks exterior points of reference. The Italian futurist Marinetti laid the groundwork for this type of sound art with his seminal ""sound poem"" Zang Tumb Tumb. Rich with inventive typography and onomatopoeias, it inspired Luigi Russolo to start building his noise machines. Kurt Schwitters' recorded sound poem, Ursonate, which Adventura Anatomica resembles, is another clear precursor to Ratkje's preference for deranged vocal sound effects to more traditional intonations. We tend to expect experimental musicians to break the mold with every effort while allowing rockers and rappers to rehearse the same idiom over and over. The vitality of Ratkje's album reveals the flaw in this thinking. Far from sounding like a derivation of the fine company it keeps, Adventura Anatomica is a singular experience. It's possible to map the terrain: the first two tracks are comprised of little more than sucking, clicking, and dragging noises scattered judiciously across a vast field of silence. As the album eventually shapes up into something like a postmodern play about fairy tales, these opening tracks are the sound of the forest set being wheeled onto the stage. On ""The Red Hooded Lady of the Woods"", the rising action begins in earnest: With the words ""Once upon a time,"" an increasing chorus of Ratkjes gradually weaves an overlapping litany into a nest of shadowy whispers. ""Too Many Trees"" is as claustrophobic as its title suggests, an intensifying nightmare amalgamation of hoarse murmurs, snorts, cackles, and chirps, as saturated as the early tracks are desiccated. ""Once Upon a Time"" grants us a respite with its eerie yet serene drones, while ""Floating, Hiding, Posing"" blends an angelic warble into a noise explosion where Ratkje beatboxes strident, concussive vocal tones that flutter and careen like bats. On ""The Wolf"", she somehow makes herself sound like a vacuum cleaner battling a squeaky rubber balloon. So, as I said, it is possible to map Adventura Anatomica. More difficult is figuring out what it's a cartography of, once all the constituent parts are assembled. Certainly, this record is about fairy tales. The imagery of trees, woods, and red hoods are a dead giveaway and the album's sense of perpetual wonder at the mundane is commensurate with fairy tales' unique logic. But it's also about the body. Listening to the record, you become aware of the body as a phenomenal sound source, suddenly noticing the musical potential of your gurgling stomach, the blood squeaking in your ears, your knuckles popping. But Adventura Anatomica transcends about; it constructs a conceptual space you enter into, and the question remains: Where are we, when we're in here? The album cover contains a clue: It's a close-up of Ratjke's face, pale amid dark hair, eyes shining like portals into an utterly interior space.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9730-adventura-anatomica/,Semishugure,2006.0,"Adventura Anatomica: A Multi-Genre Journey of Exploration

Maja Ratkje's Adventura Anatomica is a musical experience like no other. This album takes the listener on a journey through sounds and genres, combining experimental, jazz, and rock elements to create a truly unique listening experience. With a rating of 7.8 out of 10, it is clear that this album has made an impact on the music scene, and it's easy to see why.

The history of Maja Ratkje is fascinating, and it's clear that she has brought her varied experiences and influences to the creation of Adventura Anatomica. As an established figure in the Norwegian music scene, Ratkje is known for her experimental approach to music. Her background includes studying composition at the Norwegian Academy of Music and performing as a solo artist and with various ensembles. All of this is evident in the ethos of Adventura Anatomica.

The album's creation story is just as exciting as the history of the artist. Ratkje has described Adventura Anatomica as a ""sonic journey,"" which is exactly how it sounds. The album is a controlled explosion of soundscapes and sonic landscapes, each track adding to the story told throughout the album.

From the opening track, ""Subito,"" Adventura Anatomica draws you in with its jazzy rhythms and experimental elements. The ethereal soundscapes in ""Fantorangen"" keep the listener entranced, while the rock-infused ""Crepuscular Hour"" is sure to have listeners out of their seats.

The instrumentation throughout the album is impressive, with the use of unconventional instruments such as the prepared piano, field recordings, and voice altering techniques. The combination of these elements creates an otherworldly soundscape that is sure to delight listeners who are looking for something out of the ordinary.

As a listener, I was particularly drawn to the track ""In Dialogue with the Ineffable,"" which features a hauntingly beautiful vocal performance by Ratkje. Her ability to blend avant-garde elements with traditional melody is evident in this track, and it showcases a side of her artistry that is both moving and inspiring.

In conclusion, Adventura Anatomica is an album that defies boundaries and genres. It's a musical journey that takes the listener through a range of emotions, from contemplative and meditative to raucous and unbridled. If you're looking for something that will push you out of your musical comfort zone, this is an album for you. Overall, I give Adventura Anatomica a solid 8 out of 10, as it is a truly exceptional album that showcases Ratkje's undeniable talent as an experimental artist.","1.

Nils Frahm,Solo,Electronic,7.3,April 10 2015,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"For many music obsessives, a first close listen to Erik Satie’s Trois Gymnopédies changes everything. The French composer’s three 19th-century piano works serve as an introduction to one kind of minimalism—maximum emotion created with the fewest ingredients—and they show what can happen when you have the right note in the right place at the right time. The formal elegance of the pieces, along with the underlying sense of yearning and clear surface beauty, have made them a natural fit for advertising and film, and the Gymnopédies long ago became ubiquitous, their structure a sort of auditory cliché. But even with the overexposure, the power of Satie’s pieces are still there inside of us, guiding how we respond to simple piano music that leaves a lot of space. Whenever contemporary composers—from Chilly Gonzales to Eluvium to Jandek to Grouper to Aphex Twin—use a piano in this way, they tap into these buried associations. German composer and producer Nils Frahm’s most recent full-length, his fine 2013 album Spaces, featured plenty of piano but found him putting the instrument into a number of different contexts and adding electronics (the set also included live tracks). But among the earliest works of his career were two albums of solo piano work, and he returns here with a third, an album he gave away free on Twitter two weeks ago. Solo is almost exactly what you might expect from a record like this one; it’s spare, it’s lyrical, it’s generally quiet, and it’s very pretty. Your mileage will vary based on whether that is enough. Sometimes solo piano albums can get too sentimental, and can begin to sound like bad TV cues; sometimes they can be a little dry and academic, and can come over like an instrumental exercise. This one mostly fits into ""just right"" territory, balancing general loveliness with space and suggestion. Frahm's piano is creaky and there's a percussive tone coursing through some of these tracks, an extra ""pling"" that marks time with every keystroke. That extra texture gives a piece like ""Merry"" a tiny bit of grit to offset a gorgeous melody that might otherwise be overbearing, and gives the more downcast ""Some"" an extra ounce of dark weight. During its best moments Solo brings to mind some of the lower-stakes work of Harold Budd, where melody and mood become two sides of the same coin. The album’s second half finds Frahm playing more with form, but oddly the variety, rather than being welcome, actually breaks the spell of the album’s first half. ""Wall"" is a loud, pulsing piece that is interesting enough on its own but derails the album’s gentle mood, while ""Immerse!"" leans toward meandering abstraction, foregoing melody and in no way justifying its almost 11-minute length. Still, for a free album that sounds very nice in a room, Solo mostly delivers, tapping into that very specific identification with the solo piano as an expression of wistful sadness.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20471-solo/,Erased Tapes,2015.0,"Solo by Nils Frahm: A Stunning Masterpiece of Electronic Music

Electronic music is sometimes considered an impersonal, cold world of beats and synthesisers. But with Solo, the latest album by Nils Frahm, we have a deeply intimate and soulful experience that resonates long after the last note has faded. This album is a masterful work of art, that showcases Frahm’s uniqueness and creativity as an electronic musician.

Nils Frahm is no newcomer to the world of electronic music. He has been creating captivating works since the mid-2000s, and Solo is a culmination of his journey to create a more personal and introspective sound. The album is the fruit of Frahm's labour, a collection of mainly solo piano pieces, with a few electronica-inspired tracks. Frahm has always been interested in exploring the beauty and nuances of sound, and in this album, he achieves a deeply immersive and affecting musical experience.

One of the most impressive things about Solo is the way Frahm evokes powerful emotions using minimal instrumentation. There are moments where the sparse arrangements are almost overwhelming; the simplicity of a single note or chord progression carrying an incredible amount of weight. Tracks like ""Ode"" and ""Some"" showcase Frahm's talent for crafting delicate, nuanced soundscapes that capture the listener's imagination.

The album also shows that Frahm was determined to create an authentic sound that reflects his personal journey. Frahm crafted the album over the course of many months, using only his favourite instruments and recording methods. He tried out a wide range of techniques, from classical piano recordings, to more experimental layering and electronic sculpting. The result is a unique sound that is both haunting and beautiful. Frahm's dedication and attention to detail shine through on every track on Solo.

My personal favourite track on the album is ""Implant"". It's a stunning display of Frahm’s technical abilities, with a rhythmic piano melody that ebbs and flows in a hypnotic fashion. The layer of droning synthesizers adds a haunting quality to the music that sends shivers down your spine. It's a truly beautiful piece of music that showcases Frahm's creative abilities.

In conclusion, Solo is a surprising gem in the world of electronic music. Nils Frahm has crafted an album that reflects his personal journey, a beautiful and introspective work of art that captures the essence of his musical ideas. He has created an album that is soulful and deeply moving, filled with delicate melodies, haunting soundscapes and beautiful arrangements. Frahm is not simply a musician, he is an artist who has created a work of pure beauty. Solo is a masterpiece and a must-listen for anyone who loves electronic music or beautiful, intricately crafted compositions.","1.

Clark,Body Riddle,Electronic,8.5,October 27 2006,Ryan Dombal,Senior Editor,"In a recent post on his MySpace page, Warp artist Chris Clark claims ""words are nothing but ineffectual in describing a body of music."" Not the most encouraging sentiment for a music reviewer, though he's probably right. And when it comes to the dense, wordless electronic opuses that are Clark's specialty, the written word can be an especially awkward translator. But just as Clark is drawn to explaining his ephemeral consciousness through brash beats and intricate melody, the urge to understand and champion such a compelling struggle is strong. While this underrated Aphex Twin disciple produces stunning machinated symphonies that are daunting in their technical proficiency, his music maintains a breathing, spontaneous dexterity. Falling in line with its title, Body Riddle encapsulates the ever-changing human form, part inexplicable being and part steadfast hardware. The continuous fluidity between those two states bolsters this puzzle's severe magnetism. What sets the album apart from Clark's other detail-oriented click-traps is its jacked-up confidence and stylistic diversity. While his most recent album, 2003's overlooked Empty the Bones of You, was a brilliant, bleak apocalyptic vision, it could easily be broken down into two categories: corrosive manic panic and somber piano elegy. Body Riddle's reach is grander and more assured with Clark now adding full flesh to the bone. The auspicious Brit infuses sonic streaks of contemporaries like Four Tet, Prefuse 73, and DJ Shadow into his repertoire, along with his usual Aphex and Boards of Canada tics. Significantly, these aren't thoughtless dilettante moves. The bright Four Tet-esque scutter of ""Night Knuckles"", for instance, is actually better than most of that artist's last LP. Similarly, the precision thump of ""Ted"" blows away anything Scott Herren's done in the last three years, and drum-programming clinic ""Herr Bar"" sounds like what Shadow should have done with his latest disc. This apprentice-master one-upmanship goes all the way to enigmatic godhead Richard D. James, who never seems to be far away from Clark's name on paper. Whereas James seems to be somewhat lost within his slippery mystique nowadays, Clark continues to mine his ominous perfectionism with increasingly spectacular ends. Finely hewn and paced, Body Riddle ebbs and flows, following an internal logic that's condensed, myriad, and unpredictable. The album's convulsing dynamics are key to its humanity. Within a single track, drum patterns and tones slide in and out while melodies intermingle and seemingly incongruous noises blend into unannounced cameos only to slip away soon after. Take album-within-a-track spectacle ""Matthew Unburdened"", which kicks in touting glitch percussion and warbling piano. Then, the beat dismantles suddenly, coming back new and improved, now with strings that sear classical ache into the song's synthetic fabric. The old world instruments take center stage for a melodramatic aside, only to finally give way to a mannered hyper-jazz denouement. That's only one song. Simply, the amount of interlocking minutiae contained within the album's skin-tight 43 minutes is staggering. The record's journey concludes with a eulogy, ""The Autumnal Crush"", which features Body Riddle's only line of intelligible language: ""And I still miss you."" Emanating from this website, the words mean little. But, within the context of this remarkably realized whole, they're completely devastating. The accompanying track fades the LP's linear life cycle with a haunting expansiveness of My Bloody Valentine drowning beneath its own distortions. Few have been able to extract sweeping emotion from such a modern sonic milieu as Clark does here. Fright, sorrow, joy, love, death-- they're all within Body Riddle's corporeal core, waiting to be whittled onto one's individual experience. It's a monumentally personal work that speaks universally; it's a glazed mirror that doesn't lie.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9557-body-riddle/,Warp,2006.0,"Greetings music lovers! Today I have the pleasure of reviewing the electronic album ""Body Riddle"" by the talented Clark. Straight out of St. Albans, Christopher Clark is a British musician who has made a name for himself in the electronic music community. Known for his signature sound that blends genres and defies classification, Clark marks his territory in the world of electronic music with this masterpiece. 

But before we dive into the album, let's take a moment to appreciate Clark's journey. With six albums to his name, Clark has spent over a decade perfecting his craft. With a career spanning over a decade, it’s clear that he is not messing around when it comes to electronic music. Born and raised in St. Albans, Clark was raised on a diet of punk-rock and metal before discovering electronic music, which has now become the hallmark of his stylistic output.

It was during his time at the University of Brighton, where he studied Music and Visual Art that he began to explore the depths of the genre. Only two years after graduating, Clark signed to Warp Records, and his rise to fame started from there. He has since been a muse to experimental electronic music, and his latest album ""Body Riddle"" is no exception.

Upon starting the album, we are welcomed by a sonic journey that takes us through various dimensions of sound, textures and rhythms. From the opening track ""Herr Barr"" to the closing track ""The Autumnal Crush,"" each track on this album is an adventure in and of itself. 

One of my favourites on this album is ""Ted,"" which creates an atmospheric sound with layers of electronic textures, field recordings, and a heavy bassline. It's a track that plagues your mind and you just can’t help but to get lost in it. If you are in the mood for a slower tempo, then the single ""Night Knuckles"" is just the track you need. With its soothing chords and soundscapes, you can just sit back, relax and get lost in it. 

Clark's ability to blend genres is best highlighted in ""Vengeance Drools,"" which starts off with a heavy metal guitar riff before transitioning into a beat-driven electronic track. The use of live instruments on the album, particularly guitars and pianos, also adds a touch of organic sound to the electronic music. 

Overall, ""Body Riddle"" is a testament to Clark's artistic ability and genre-defying style. Fans of electronic music and fans of experimental music will find elements of both in this album. With its intricate layers of sound and sophisticated production value, it's an album that can just as easily be enjoyed on a sound system at home as it can be at a festival. 

As someone who loves electronic music, I thoroughly enjoyed this album. The attention to detail and the artistic expression that Clark put into it are evident in every track. I would definitely give this album an 8.5 out of 10 for its innovation, creativity, and intricacy. Whether you’re a fan of Clark or just looking to expand your musical horizons, ""Body Riddle"" is an album that you won't want to miss out on.","1.

Soulwax,FROM DEEWEE,Electronic,7.0,April 7 2017,Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,Contributor,"If every ’90s alternative act updated their sound as gracefully as the Belgian electro-rock outfit Soulwax, the alternative era might never have ended. Hold the band’s latest full-length up to, say, God Lives Underwater’s likeminded 1998 sophomore effort Life in the So-Called Space Age, and you might think the two titles came out no more than a couple of years apart. On closer inspection, though, FROM DEEWEE* *gives us a glimpse of what those ’90s acts would sound like today had they managed to loosen up just enough to absorb modern sensibilities. When Soulwax debuted with Leave the Story Untold back in 1996, their music had some pluck but did little to distinguish itself from the guitar bands flooding the market at the time. Soulwax would go on to reinvent themselves as a Britpop, synthpop, techno, and dance-remix act. They declared their omnivorous tastes on 2005 reworking of Daft Punk’s “Teachers,” which name-dropped a litany of influences from the Cramps to Kyuss to Urban Dance Squad to ELO. By their 2016 soundtrack to the film Belgica, core members Stephen and David Dewaele were basically play-acting from a grab bag of styles. But even when their genre exercises were spot-on, Belgica prodded the question: who is this band? This time, the Dewaele brothers and their cast of supporting musicians finally have a coherent sound. And while it isn’t exactly revolutionary, FROM DEEWEE reconciles the polarity between Soulwax’s rock and electronic sides. Drawing from a battery of three drummers (including none other than former Sepultura ballast Igor Cavalera), the Dewaele’s marry synths to dusty, boxed-in live drums. That contrast prevents the album from tipping too far into the artificial and also works as a counterweight to how the band self-consciously references the past. From Deewee hearkens back to those halcyon days where funk, disco, krautrock, new wave, rap, and punk all flowed forth into the same pool. The main melody and wheezing steam-engine groove of “My Tired Eyes” both recall classic Depeche Mode, while “Conditions of a Shared Belief” wears the influence of Eddy Grant’s 1982 smash hit “Electric Avenue” on its sleeve. But even at their most electronically inclined, Soulwax remain a ’90s rock act at heart. Mining the disco era, the Dewaele brothers scuff things up, stopping just short of lo-fi. (The album was in fact recorded live with the band capturing songs all together in one take.) That’s not to say the Dewaeles give production short shrift here. On the contrary: The production is skilled and meticulous. The synths are rich and robust, and the brothers layer multiple drumsets with a sense of finesse that evokes John McEntire’s classic work at the boards for Stereolab. But compared to the haphazard variety of Belgica, FROM DEEWEE comes across with a uniformity and stylishness that grounds its playful moments, such as the punk drumming that introduces and closes the otherwise gleaming synth number “Missing Wires.” As far-reaching as Belgica got, it lacked the simple majesty of the vocal melodies the Dewaele’s have a field day with this time around. Soulwax betray their ’90s roots the most with their singing. On “Masterplanned,” the main vocal walks the line between dour monotone and sublime earworm. On the other hand, towards the end of “Missing Wires,” a strobing organ figure touches on the upbeat dance style that countless modern indie bands have built careers on. More nimble than they’ve ever been, the Dewaele brothers manage to stack three different eras of music on top of one another without anchoring their songs to any of them. Soulwax have always been a band in transit from one style to the next. On FROM DEEWEE, they arrive at the settled creative space they’ve hinted at but never quite reached in the past. As “Masterplanned” goes, “Thought the journey was the point of the race/But it seems the destination has taken its place.”",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23061-from-deewee/,Play It Again Sam,2017.0,"Soulwax's latest album 'FROM DEEWEE' is a testament to the band's ability to consistently produce electronic music with a unique and innovative flair. The group has been in the music industry for over 20 years, starting off as a rock band before transitioning into electronic music in the early 2000s. With a reputation for producing memorable dance hits and a penchant for experimentation, it's no wonder that their latest effort is worth a listen.

The story behind FROM DEEWEE is an interesting one - it was recorded entirely in a single, intense take at the Dewaele brothers' Deewee studio in Ghent, Belgium. It's an impressive feat that showcases the band's technical proficiency and their ability to create an immersive experience. The album is a collection of unreleased tracks that were never performed live, making it feel like a hidden treasure for longtime fans and new listeners alike.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Is It Always Binary,"" which boasts an infectious bassline and catchy electronic beats. The song is reminiscent of the band's early sound, with a nod to classic 80s electronic music. ""Missing Wires"" is another track worth mentioning, featuring a dreamy synth melody that creates an ethereal soundscape. The album's titular track ""DEEWEE"" is also a noteworthy highlight, with its pulsating rhythms and glitchy effects.

Despite its strengths, there are a few moments in the album where the pacing can feel a bit frenetic. The transitions between tracks can sometimes feel abrupt, disrupting the overall cohesion of the album. However, this is a minor quibble in what is otherwise a well-produced and carefully crafted album.

As someone who has been a fan of Soulwax for nearly a decade, I can attest that 'FROM DEEWEE' stays true to the band's vision while still pushing the limits of their sound. It's a testament to the band's dedicated fanbase and their ability to stay relevant through the years. For newcomers to the band, this album is a solid introduction to their unique brand of electronic music. Overall, I would give 'FROM DEEWEE' a solid rating of 7.0 out of 10 - a worthy addition to any electronic music library.","Step 1: Review A uses more complex and varied sentence structures, while Review B takes a more straightforward approach.

Various Artists,"Kill Bill, Vol. 1",,8.7,October 19 2003,Alex Linhardt,,"The life of a hipster is arduous and complex, teeming with expensive haircuts, the obligation to buy the CDs the webzines have arbitrarily deemed cool, and those frilled skirts that you have to keep tugging at in the frigid lines to get into Chelsea's Bungalow 8. I mean, goddamn, it's like thirty degrees out there. The Hipster Handbook helped a little, but not enough. The questions linger. Is it cooler to be metrosexual, or to pretend to be metrosexual while actually being homosexual? Is it cooler to be an actual hipster, an ironic hipster, or the oft-imitated ""fool on the hill"" hipster? For those answers, only deep meditation can help; on the musical side of things, Quentin Tarantino has graciously solved many of our problems. The ramifications of this album on the young proto-hipster set will be incalculable. Simply for comparison, think about how you'd soundtrack Kill Bill. The best I can come up with is putting Genesis' ""I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)"" over the climactic sword fight. Thank god, then, that the album, like the movie, was compiled by people who obviously have encyclopedic minds able to forge visual/musical puns and scorching contrasts between maddeningly obscure pop treasures. This is like a guidebook to the different genres needed to be cool. To quickly categorize: Perverse torch songs, menacing revved-up rockabilly, ancient slasher scores, Wu-Tang allegiances, blaxploitation funk, swing, 70s disco, Japanese punk-pop, spy anthems. They even put on a quick excerpt of Neu! And all the rest consists of the best spaghetti western rip-offs of all time. At my screening, people were passing out in the aisles during the opening credits alone, clutching each other, finding the speed of sound insufficient, and hence feebly grasping at the sound emanating from the speakers, slamming their empty hands into their ears, trying to get even more music into their heads. If the Pulp Fiction soundtrack birthed a million surf-rock fanatics, this album is going to reinvigorate every genre simultaneously. Whereas the Jackie Brown soundtrack occasionally felt hampered by songs that drew most of their interest from their relationship to the movie, these songs not only are able to exist independently from their cinematic representations, but, at their best, exceed even the sheer jaw-dropping coolness of the scenes they scored. The opener is Nancy Sinatra's enrapturing Hazlewood-produced gruesome breakup threnody, ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"". Next to a solitary guitar played by an underwater mortician, Sinatra sings the incomparable intro, ""I was five and he was six/ We rode on horses made of sticks..."" And these were written by Sonny Bono! If you're trying to make tedium, you can have John Williams; if you're trying to make a movie, you better make damn sure you have a Nancy Sinatra song in it. Sun Records pioneer Charlie Feathers' ""That Certain Female"" is all warbling lasciviousness. In the lengthy history of country/blues/rock tunes that start with a god-defying ""Wellllllllll...,"" this is in the very top tier. Whether he ever found his woman or not, his concupiscence has been fulfilled. The eight-minute epic of Santa Esmeralda's ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" is the Animals classic via Latin disco, dissolving in an astonishingly complex string arrangement (well, for disco anyway). The Arctic reed-and-bells of Meiko Kaji's ""The Flower of Carnage"" ain't Baudelaire, but it gets the job done, Will Oldham-style: ""Begrieving snow falls in the dead morning/ Stray dog's howls and the footsteps of Geta pierce the air."" The remainder, and far superior, material is instrumental music cribbed from other movies. The best piece, Luis Bacalov's ""The Grand Duel (Parte Prima)"" (which accompanies the film's well-publicized anime sequence) is all operatic poltergeist sirens and campfire acoustic guitar. It's unabashedly plagiarized Ennio Morricone and, even then, deserves to be in the same sentence with him. The Bernard Herrmann theme to Twisted Nerve (the whistling nurse one) begins with whistle-while-we-work conviviality and flourishes into a demented shock of orchestral dread. Al Hirt's version of the Green Hornet theme is what ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" always promised to be, bearing the most ridiculous trumpet line since the theme to The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Once the tortuous, dizzying riff ends, a strong sturdy tone emerges that, by the end, has started battling the initial trumpet for control of the song, concluding in a bop that grows dangerously close to free jazz. There are two slight, avoidable problems. Many will probably decry the RZA's lyrics to ""Ode to Oren Ishii"". I will concede that he did indeed rhyme ""Ishii"" with ""Japaneseshi."" For a few years now, RZA has been adopting the unconvincingly out-of-control emotional delivery of Ghostface Killah with the lyrical inanity of ODB. It should be hilarious; it probably is. Secondly, a lot of music from the movie is missing, which I normally wouldn't deign to mention except that in the case of a soundtrack that is more or less dedicated to Morricone mood, it's just senseless to leave out ""Death Rides a Horse"". Perhaps even more significantly, I have no idea what depraved mind neglected to include the greatest garage-rock song of all time, The Human Beinz's ""Nobody But Me"". It would not be overreacting to murder the criminal. Still, who cares? As this review testifies, I am not qualified to critique music. However, if you dislike more than a third of these songs, you are not qualified to listen to music.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7887-kill-bill-vol-1/,Maverick,2003.0,"When it comes to movie soundtracks, Kill Bill, Vol. 1 by Various Artists has got to be one of the most iconic and enduring compositions of all time. The album embodies the perfect fusion of different genres and musical styles, delivering distinct film themes while maintaining seamless transitions between the tracks. Indeed, with a rating of 8.7 out of 10, it’s easy to see why it has continued to captivate music lovers since its release in 2003.

Before diving into the actual music, let's talk about the composition of the album. The score was created by renowned composer and performer, RZA, of the Wu-Tang Clan, which sets up the soundtrack to lead the listener on a journey through different sections of each song. Each track is placed in a precise order that creates a story within the music itself. It’s impressive to see a collaborative work like this come together in such a cohesive and remarkable way.

The album is filled with some of the most memorable tracks of the past two decades, such as Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down),"" which sets the tone for the entire soundtrack. It’s entrancing guitar riff provides a guaranteed eargasm to anyone listening to it. And who could forget about the thrilling ""Battle without Honor or Humanity"" by Tomoyasu Hotei – a true masterpiece among films’ instrumental tracks.

One of my favorite aspects of the album is the seamless blend of different genres. The traditional Japanese rhythms in ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" along with the vintage 60s pop song ""Woo Hoo"" by the 5.6.7.8's , mixed with the East and West fusion in ""Crane/White Lightning,"" is a complete treat for the ears. Everything just flows seamlessly from track to track, while still managing to sound completely distinct.

Ultimately, Kill Bill, Vol. 1, stands out as a unique and stunning soundtrack that truly captures the film's essence in its soundscape. It never feels like a compilation of music from different artists but rather a complete body of work that stands on its own. From the epic ""Twisted Nerve"" opening track to the thrilling ""Ironside"" by Quincy Jones, everything feels perfectly placed and makes perfect sense. It's a testament to the power of collaboration, and how different artists can come together for a greater purpose: to create a work of art.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend Kill Bill, Vol. 1 to anyone looking to revisit one of the most iconic soundtracks of our time. It's filled with memorable tracks that will stay with you long after the songs have ended, all while showcasing a captivating fusion of different sounds and genres. So, if you haven't listened to it yet or it’s been a while, do yourself a favor, sit back and let the music take you on an unexpected but welcome thrill ride.","1.

St. Vincent,MassEducation,Rock,7.2,October 16 2018,Arielle Gordon,Contributor,"The acoustic album is a rite of passage. It marks a period when the tour, the band, and the press has left an artist yearning to be seen in a soft new light: For Nirvana, their MTV Unplugged performance was a middle finger to the hype machine—one of the biggest, loudest rock bands on earth settling in for some quiet covers and deep cuts. Mariah Carey’s 1992 acoustic EP set out to disprove naysayers who claimed her lack of touring equated to lack of talent. For St. Vincent, whose promotional circuit for 2017’s Masseduction featured latex accessories, pop-up art galleries, and interviews given from inside a hot-pink cube, an intimate, no-frills album is a welcome antidote to a career defined by cult and concept. Masseduction used locomotive synths and schoolyard call-and-responses to project an image of manic sensuality, while Annie Clark took on the public persona of “dominatrix at the mental institution.” It was a vision that deferred and distracted from questions of a more personal nature, perhaps a defense mechanism following her whirlwind year in the spotlight with her relationship with model and actress Cara Delevingne. But behind all the leopard print and leather, the record was a romantic opus filled with simple melodrama: “You and me, we’re not meant for this world,” she sang on “Hang on Me,” as if starring in her own John Hughes movie. Recorded over two days at Manhattan’s Reservoir Studios studios, MassEducation strips its hypersexual, neon-clad predecessor for parts, exposing its songs as tales of longing and nostalgia. Clark seemed to always know that her record contained two lives: “This needs to be something people can really dance to,” she said of a song on her last album, “until they listen to the words and then they’re crying.” Hiding melancholy behind pop production is nothing new, but on an album so saturated with sadness, these pared-down renderings give Clark a chance to indulge in their underlying sentiments. Accompanied by longtime friend Thomas Bartlett (a frequent producer for Sufjan Stevens) on the piano, Clark’s voice expands and contracts, varyingly snarky and flat, honeyed and affectionate, husky and sensual. On “Slow Disco,” her voice wells up, rich and velvetine, as she muses, “Am I thinking what everybody’s thinking?” On an earlier club remix of the same track, dubbed “Fast Slow Disco,” the line is more of a wink towards promiscuity. Here, the same lyrics come off as a desperate cry for connection. “Young Lover,” a tragic depiction of drug addiction that once masked itself behind triumphant electric guitars, reveals the frustration and pain in her voice, an almost uncomfortably close portrayal of a disastrous relationship. The record also gives Clark room to be completely vulnerable—on Masseduction’s “Sugarboy,” the closing refrain of “Boys! Girls!” sounds like an industrial machine running out of juice. Here, Clark embodies this exhaustion, as if fatigued by her own sexual intensity. Bartlett recontextualizes Clark’s delivery throughout the record via his reinventions of the piano. It builds tension and foreboding in the maudlin dance-with-death “Smoking Section,” punctuating the air between Clark’s increasingly morbid verses. On “Savior,” Bartlett plays the inner strings of his instrument like a violin, the staccato notes fighting against Clark’s drawn-out vocals. The high-octave, mile-a-minute progressions on “Sugarboy” lend a strikingly expressive counterpart to her animalistic, baritone interpretation of the song’s chorus. It might not sound as alien as Clark’s glam guitars, but it makes room for the otherworldly range of emotions in her voice. On “Fear the Future,” the wailing of electric guitars is replaced by maximalist, thundering crashes on the piano, turning an apocalyptic screed into a frenetic fear of the unknown. Of course, there are natural limits to the acoustic format. Without the sleek production posse of Jack Antonoff and Sounwave, prosaic lyricism has nowhere to hide. The already saccharine chorus of “Pills” sounds like the theatrical performance of a junk food jingle here. Similarly, her thinly veiled criticism of image-obsessed Angelinos on “Los Ageless” loses its sexiness and sheen, leaving in its wake a smokey, hollow cabaret crooner. “Hang on Me,” a woozy post-club comedown, takes on a second life as a kind of modern lullaby, one with a bit of added schmaltz but no less flair than the original, a rendition that wouldn’t feel out of place over a tender familial flashback from “This Is Us.” For Clark, the intimacy of MassEducation is the natural conclusion to nearly a decade of life behind rotating personas: a jealous, pill-popping housewife, a self-described “near-future cult leader,” and most recently, a sexed-up, technicolor seductress. But on the cover of this record, all we see is Annie Clark: blurry, yes, but also literally laid bare. She has discussed the idea of songs having multiple lives, and that people, too, can live more than one existence in parallel, always aware of their diametric opposite. These songs bridge the gap between the two, exposing the overwhelming darkness that unifies her eclectic output along the way.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/st-vincent-masseducation/,Loma Vista,2018.0,"St. Vincent's latest album, MassEducation, brings a fresh and enchanting take on the band's iconic rock sound. With a rating of 7.2 out of 10, the album's emotional intensity is undeniable. From the opening track to the final note, St. Vincent has us captivated with her soulful lyrics and masterful guitar playing.

For those unfamiliar with St. Vincent's music, she, aka Annie Clark, has been making music for over a decade now. She had previously released the album 'Masseduction.' The idea behind the stripped-down album was inspired by her live performances. Clark has always had a signature sound with her synthesized beats, distorted guitars, and pop sensibilities. However, in MassEducation, she's transformed her songs into stark, direct, and never predictable versions that show off her fearsome guitar skills and romantic leanings.

In terms of the album's creation story, Clark sat down with only a piano and her guitar; a decision that made a significant difference in the final outcome. The majority of the songs in MassEducation come from 2017's Masseduction, but as Clark said, ""it felt like a totally different animal. I think of this less as a stripped-down version of the original record and more like its own thing.""

The opening track on this album is ""Slow Disco,"" and it's a standout track for a reason. The original song was a dance-floor banger, but this version, in my opinion, is the most tragic song on the album. The stripped-down version is built around St. Vincent's unique sound that forms a perfect foundation for her vocal performance. With talk-singing bits, the strings cast a supporting role in this orchestral arrangement. It's a downtrodden, longing number that lands hard in the end.

Other tracks, like ""New York,"" ""Los Ageless,"" and ""Young Lover,"" all retain their idiosyncratic style in their remake, but ""Happy Birthday, Johnny"" is the stand-out song for me. This heartbreaking track, written for a friend who has passed away, reveals the emotional trauma that was previously lost in the pop appeal of the original tune. The piano's simplicity coupled with St. Vincent's vocals create such an emotive experience that'll make you empathize with the singer's sad loss.

Overall, you can say that the album's overall vibe is melancholic, and this is perhaps where I think the rating of 7.2 out of 10 must come from. That said, the songs still have that snapshot-like clarity and an aura of reliability that will keep you coming back for more. The vulnerability with which Clark tackles each song can't be stressed enough. The album successfully captured the essential elements of each song and left us all feeling as if we've learned something new about the songs we thought we already knew. It's a fantastic album from an exceptional artist, and It's one that you should reserve time to listen to.","Step 1: Review A is a longer and more detailed review compared to Review B.

Pole,Pole,Electronic,5.5,August 4 2003,Mark Richardson,Contributor,"Like anyone else who followed Stefan Betke's Pole through the twists and turns of his glitchy laptop dub sound only to arrive at the charming cul de sac of 2000's Pole 3, I've wondered where Pole would (or could) go next. Betke had seemingly squeezed everything he could from a broken Waldorf filter, hiss, crackles and room-shaking bass (and all things considered he extracted some very good music); his next full-length record, it seemed, would involve a new direction out of necessity. And so it does. As previewed on two EPs (45/45 and 90/90, the latter being more of a DJ tool with its multiple versions of a single track), Pole has scrubbed up his sound considerably, fleshed out his beats with upfront drums, and opened himself to collaboration. The noise that previously filled the chasms of space-- all the sonic byproduct that used to all but define him as a producer-- are essentially gone. In fact, you may not hear a cleaner record this year. As for the collaborators, the most notable addition is backpack rapper Fat Jon, who lends his lyrics and his dispassionate diction to four of the record's nine tracks. Other tracks include acoustic bassist August Engkilde and saxophonist Thomas Haas. Taken together, these changes completely shuffle the deck for Pole. Unfortunately, it doesn't come up aces. Pole has some worrying problems, starting with the tracks featuring Fat Jon. On the one hand, given the sparking minimalism of Pole's new musical direction, Fat Jon seems a logical choice for vocals. His style is equally clear and precise, and he can rap with speed and skillfully navigate complex phrases without losing the rhythm. His lyrical interests tend toward the phenomenological, probing the nature of the way we experience time, love, and struggle, among other concerns, and they are not without insight. But Fat Jon's style is so removed, so focused on the word at the expense of quirkiness or hooks (each of his choruses is just a phrase repeated ad nauseum), his raps just hang there like another element on the Cubase grid. Even allowing for lack of interest and knowledge in underground rap, Fat Jon still strikes me as a rather dull stylist. There is no tension when his voice is set against Pole's beats, and the pairing ends up being too complimentary. Generous collaborator that he is, Betke's backing tracks for Fat Jon are just that, background loops used to support vocalist's ideas in the words. Betke stretches a bit more on Pole's five instrumentals, and in a few of these are seeds for a potentially interesting album. The honking saxophone that Haas adds fills the stainless steel dub of ""Bushes (There is a Secret Behind)"" provides just the sort of tonal contrast that the track needs (it's also the only track with a hint of a crackle). ""Green is Not Green (Yellow)"" also has some of Hass' riffing, this time with Engkile adding some loping upright bass. It's one of the loosest and funkiest Pole tracks extant, and, with its melodica accents, is the most dub selection on Pole by far. I already raved about ""Back Home"" when I talked about the 45/45 EP; suffice to say that it's a glowing surge of joy more nakedly emotional than you imagined a Pole track could be. Pole goes out on a limb on ""Back Home"" and it works; elsewhere, he goes out on a limb and it doesn't. In lieu of a green-sleeved Pole 4, we take what we can get.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6370-pole/,Mute,2003.0,"Electronic music fans, get ready for a musical adventure! Pole's self-titled album is here to take you on a wild techno journey. The German duo is known for their minimalistic sound, and they certainly deliver that in spades with this album.

Pole (aka Stefan Betke) has been a pioneer in the electronic music scene for over two decades. He started out producing music in the early 90s, experimenting with sound and drawing from dub and reggae influences. His music was well-received and he quickly gained a following.

The creation story of ""Pole"" is an interesting one. Betke found inspiration for the album while out on a hike, surrounded by nature. He was struck by the sounds of the forest around him and was inspired to create an album that captured the essence of those sounds. He used field recordings of nature and manipulated them to weave them into the album's soundscapes.

The album's opening track, ""Komet,"" sets the tone for the rest of the record. It's a slow-burning track that builds anticipation and leaves you wanting more. The use of space in the track is impressive – the minimalism of the sound leaves ample room for the listener to fill in the gaps with their imagination.

The album continues to transport the listener as it progresses. ""Gelb"" is a standout track – the vocals are processed in a unique way that makes them sound like they're coming through a radio frequency. The heavy bassline and sparse drum pattern create a hypnotic effect that lures you into the music.

One personal opinion I have about this album is that it's not for everyone. Where some listeners may find it repetitive and lacking in variety, others will appreciate the focus on sound manipulation and texture. This is not a ""background music"" kind of album – it demands your attention and rewards you for giving it.

Overall, Pole's self-titled album is a strong effort for fans of experimental electronic music. While it may not be the most accessible album, it's certainly an interesting and sophisticated one. It's worth a listen for those who want to explore the deeper reaches of electronic music.","1. Review A is longer and more detailed, covering specific aspects of Pole's music and collaborations

Diet Cig,Over Easy EP,Rock,6.1,February 24 2015,Jamieson Cox,Contributor,"Diet Cig burst out of the Hudson Valley college town and musical hotbed New Paltz, N.Y., this January with a memorable name and an origin story like something from a microbudget romantic comedy. Singer Alex Luciano and drummer Noah Bowman met at a house show when she interrupted a set to ask him for a lighter; a few months later, they were playing shows and getting ready to record their first songs at a studio in New Paltz. Over Easy, their debut EP, is the product of that labor, a collection of brisk, personal pop-punk that recalls '90s bands like Beat Happening or Tiger Trap in its simplicity and Eternal Summers in its tone. It's not hard to get to the core of the songs on Over Easy. Built mostly out of Bowman's frenzied drumming and Luciano's distorted guitar and vocals, they're simple, propulsive, and monochromatic; they're dense, but not rich with detail. They mostly serve as vehicles for Luciano's reflections on the life changes, relationships, and social anxiety that characterize extended adolescence. It's a time that's served as fodder for more than its share of music, but Luciano comes at it with a keen observational eye and a fresh perspective. She turns opener ""Breathless"", an anthem for people living independently for the first time, into something with character through her use of location and detail (like the fact that she's still missing a shower curtain). In other moments, she has a knack for memorable and catchy phrasing that reminds me of Dashboard Confessional, specifically the way every song threatened to break into a cathartic group singalong in a live setting. When she hammers out the line, ""and I am sweating and I'm/ betting you are, too!"" in the chorus of ""Pool Boyz"", it's easy to imagine a roomful of people yelling it with her and revelling in the song's heat and pent-up lust. There are moments on Over Easy where Diet Cig crosses the line from relatable young adult angst into petulant, immature whining. There are pieces of ""Scene Sick"" that are appealing on their own—the way its slow shuffle explodes into a speedy romp, the nicely varied percussive elements—but when tossed together with Luciano's powdered sugar vocal, it's painfully saccharine. It's also based around a complaint that's remarkably insular, namely the oppressiveness of the titular scene; it's a sentiment that likely resonates with people who have spent a lot of time embedded in the music industry, but without that context it hews a little closer to straightforward whining. Closer ""Harvard"", fuller and funnier and more dynamic, does a better job of conveying that kind of annoyance by focusing on a snobby, jerky ex. There's obvious talent and light in these songs, though it's also obvious that Diet Cig are still in their infancy. (In spending time with the EP, I kept coming back to Eternal Summers' ""Lightswitch"" as a best case scenario for songs of this length and complexity: more colour, more depth, more space, more intensity.) There's promise here, but Over Easy barely scrapes the 10 minute mark, and the duo's next release will be the one that really proves their worth.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20237-over-easy-ep/,Father/Daughter,2015.0,"Are you in the market for some new feel-good rock tunes? Look no further than Diet Cig's ""Over Easy EP"". With a solid rating of 6.1 out of 10, this four-track album delivers just the right amount of punk attitude and infectious hooks to get you moving.

Let's start with a bit about the band. Diet Cig is an indie rock band from New Paltz, New York, formed in 2014 by lead vocalist and guitarist Alex Luciano and drummer Noah Bowman. They first gained traction with their 2015 debut album ""Sleep Talk"", which showcased their raw and energetic sound. ""Over Easy EP"", released in 2016, cemented their place in the rock scene with its catchy riffs and relatable lyrics.

The story behind the creation of this album is one of spontaneity and passion. According to Luciano, the two had just finished recording ""Sleep Talk"" when they decided to go back into the studio and record these four tracks. They had a clear vision of what they wanted the songs to sound like, and recorded them all in one day. This sense of urgency comes through in the energy of the tracks, and adds to their charm.

So, let's dive into the songs themselves. ""Breathless"" kicks things off with a bang, featuring a pulsing riff and Luciano's powerful vocals. The chorus is so catchy, you'll find yourself humming it for days. ""Pool Boyz"" is a bit more laid-back, with a bouncy guitar line and some playful lyrics about teenage crushes. ""Scene Sick"" is a standout track, with its driving beat and lyrics about feeling out of place in the music scene. The EP concludes with ""Harvard"", a slower and more introspective track that showcases Luciano's emotional range.

As for my personal experience with the album, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I'm not usually a big fan of punk or garage rock, but something about the lively spirit of Diet Cig's music drew me in. The lyrics are relatable and honest, and Luciano's vocals are truly impressive. If you're looking for some music to blast while driving with the windows down, or just need a pick-me-up on a dreary day, ""Over Easy EP"" is the perfect choice.","1.

Muggs,Dust,,1.1,March 24 2003,Mark Martelli,,"Was I absent when they announced that applying mid-90s hip-hop dynamics to the resurrection of Manchester's trip-hop ghost was a surefire formula for post-pinnacle glory? Whatever memo found its way into Cypress Hill DJ Muggs' drug drawer must surely deserve the blame for Dust, a technically competent but lacking attempt to expand the producer's repertoire beyond the dusty, wet-smoking rhythmic foundations he laid down on early Cypress albums, using the nu-metal crossover of their 2000 disc, Skull and Bones, as the point of disembarking. You won't hear anything that draws from the gloomy barrio beats of Temples of Doom or Black Sunday, and the dearth of MCs guarantees no lyrical meditations to rival ""How Could I Just Kill a Man""; even ""Dr. Greenthumb"" rises above. With the exception of Everlast, who contributes his Kentucky moonshiner exhalations to the boring, heart-broken sob-story ""Gone for Good"", the majority of the vocal contributions here are made by female singers, chanteuses who at all times strain to approximate the performances of trip-hop notables like Beth Gibbons, Björk, Tracey Thorn, and anyone else who sounds impressively sultry, strung out and seductive. That seems to be the order of the day for Muggs; the cranky wall-of-noise ""Dead Flowers"", the blatant ""Angel"" ripoff ""I Know"", and ""Tears"" are as contrived and forgettable as their titles suggest, and equally interchangeable. Juxtapose, Muggs' loose collaboration with Tricky, seems to have rubbed off and drifted to the surface, but Muggs can't quite pin it down. So instead, it flies all over the room, shitting everywhere and squawking rabidly, and we're left with some weak Britpop hybrids (with the embarrassingly saccharine ""Rain"" at the top of the list) and some token snippets of studio tomfoolery, ranging from the almost-clever Laswell IDM of ""Shadows"" to the, um, almost-clever ambient music of ""Niente"". I pity the fool who has to clean this up. It's an unrefined, poorly calculated mess. I know everything reads to the contrary, but I'm not doubting DJ Muggs. Really. You can't fuck with the aforementioned Cypress records; shit, even the Muggs-produced ""Babalu Bad Boy"" rocked the house harder than anything on Dust ten years prior. Would it help to know that on the CD I'm looking at, it boasts: ""A down-tempo rock masterpiece by Cypress Hill's legendary producer""? No, I'm not doubting DJ Muggs. I'm doubting the quality of a song like ""Morta"", with its jack-in-the-box flamenco bombast struggling to impersonate Björk's ""I Play Dead"", which isn't that good to begin with anyway. I'm questioning any excuse you can think of for the trite, nasally ""Faded"": ""We are, we are, we are, we are always faded/ You are, you are, you are the one in my pages...""? What is the excuse for that bullshit? Get this out of my house.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5497-dust/,Anti-,2003.0,"The music industry is as diverse and expansive as the universe, and it is a privilege to encounter exceptional artists such as Muggs. With an impressive track record in the world of hip-hop, Muggs has become a household name over the years. However, his latest music album 'Dust' is a departure from the norm as it incorporates a new music genre: nan. 

Let's start with the band's history. Muggs was a prominent figure in the hip-hop world, serving as the co-founding member of the revered Cypress Hill. His stern beats and deep, '90s-era beats contributed to the group's success. From there, Muggs went on to produce hits for the likes of House of Pain, Ice Cube, and many other notable names in the industry.

'Dust' marks Muggs' foray into the relatively unknown world of nan, a genre that's almost exclusive to the use of machine learning algorithms in the composition process. As such, 'Dust' is a piece of art that's more machine than human, and it's not without its challenges.

But challenges aside, 'Dust' is a marvel of modern music creation. The album's production is done with mathematical precision, creating a striking soundscape that's both unique and familiar. Listening to 'Dust' leaves no doubt that Muggs is a seasoned producer with a keen ear for detail.

However, the nan genre creates a disconnect between the listener and the music. The lack of human touch and emotions makes 'Dust' sound robotic and unfeeling. The music feels more like a series of equations than an expression of art. 

That being said, 'Dust' is an album worth listening to, especially for those who want to explore the possibilities of nan music. The beats are solid, the production is top-notch, and Muggs' courage to experiment with new genres is admirable.

In conclusion, 'Dust' might not resonate with fans who've enjoyed Muggs' past work, but it deserves praise for its technical brilliance and the courage to shift from the mainstream. Fans of the nan genre will surely appreciate this work of art, but beyond that, 'Dust' is a challenging listen that may not connect with the masses.","1.

Neil Young,Peace Trail,Rock,6.7,December 8 2016,Sam Sodomsky,Associate Staff Writer,"“Things here have changed,” announces a computerized voice at the end of Peace Trail, the scrappy and strange new album by Neil Young. The song is called “My New Robot” and it might be about a recent divorcee taking comfort in the presence of “Alexa,” the voice-activated feature of Amazon’s new household device Echo. But those four words at the end, which introduce a barrage of online sounds (requesting to swipe your card, enter your pin number, your mother’s maiden name) hint at the bigger picture behind the record. As a songwriter, Neil Young has always thrived in shaky times. Whether it’s the deflated hippy dreams of his mid-seventies Ditch Trilogy or the road-weary breakup anthems that comprised 1992’s Harvest Moon, Neil’s best work often feels like a gut reaction to turbulence. More than any album since 2006’s Living With War—the Bush-era treatise that called for impeachment and looked to Obama as a beacon of hope—*Peace Trail *is a product of its time. Its ten sparse protest songs address the dissemination of fake news, the mistreatment of America’s indigenous people, and the water crisis in Flint. As suggested by his open letter about Standing Rock, Young remains a vigilant and thoughtful observer, staying up to date on important issues and fighting for what he believes is right. And while the songs on Peace Trail are unquestionably timely and occasionally poignant, Young’s songwriting-as-immediate-response sometimes fails him. His musings throughout the album often scan as non-sequitur sentimentality (“Up in the rainbow teepee sky/No one’s looking down on you or I”) or just plain non-sequitur (“Bring back the days when good was good”). You get the sense his goal here was to finish the songs as quickly as possible (maybe so he could perform nearly half the album at Desert Trip Festival), when a few more days of editing might have resulted in a more powerful listen. The same hurried approach Young takes with the lyrics, however, actually benefits the overall sound of the record. After last year’s Monsanto Years, Young has ditched his Promise of the Real backing band, whose tentative roots rock recalled, at best, a small town Crazy Horse cover band. On Peace Trail, he’s accompanied by two session musicians who mostly make themselves scarce. Most songs feature only Neil’s acoustic guitar along with unobtrusive bass and delicate, brush-stroked drums. It results in an album that feels refreshingly unlabored and current. On two tracks, Young even adopts an Auto-Tune vocal effect (maybe something he picked up from jamming with D.R.A.M.?). On Earth, the bizarro live album he released earlier this year, the effect was used as a commentary on inorganic food; on Peace Trail, it’s no joke. In the nearly-spoken-word “My Pledge,” Young’s Auto-Tuned harmonies aid the inscrutable narrative (which seems to connect the voyage of the Mayflower with our attraction to iPhones and maybe also the death of Jimi Hendrix?) with a disorienting layered effect. Two of the most effective songs on Peace Trail happen to be the ones least directly associated with the headlines. “Can’t Stop Workin’” offers an insight into Young’s creative process, borrowing a chord progression from his estranged colleague David Crosby while also hinting at a possible reunion: “I might take some time off,” he sings, “for forgiveness.” “Glass Accident,” meanwhile, uses breaking glass and the dangerous mess it makes as a metaphor for lack of accountability in the U.S. government (“Too many pieces there for me to clean up/So I left a warning message by the door”). Even more than the disquieting, if distractingly literal, narratives of tracks like “Show Me” and “Indian Givers,” these songs examine Young’s values at this stage in his career and illustrate his strength in communicating his concerns. And while Young’s voice has certainly never sounded older than it does here, there’s something youthful about his energy. Besides the fact that his two-album-a-year-clip keeps him in pace with your Ty Segalls or John Dwyers, his music is guided by a restless determination to cover new ground and speak his mind. “Don’t think I’ll cash it in yet… I keep planting seeds ’til something new is growing,” he sings in the title track: it’s long been both his gift and his curse.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22654-peace-trail/,Reprise,2016.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to dive deep into the soulful and passionate world of Neil Young's latest album, ""Peace Trail."" As a die-hard fan of the legendary singer-songwriter, I was eagerly waiting for this album to drop, and boy, it did not disappoint!

Let's start with a brief rundown of Neil Young's life and career. He is a Canadian musician, famous for his unique voice and signature guitar sound. He started his journey with the band Buffalo Springfield and went onto playing with Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young in the early 70s. His solo career dates back to the late sixties, and it's been a rollercoaster ride ever since. His music has always been a reflection of the socio-political climate, and Peace Trail is no different.

The album was recorded in four days, straight to analog tape, in Rick Rubin's Shangri-La Studios, Malibu. Neil Young is accompanied by two legendary musicians, Jim Keltner on drums, and Paul Bushnell on bass. The album is eight tracks long, spanning a little over half an hour, and it's nothing short of a musical masterpiece.

The first track, Peace Trail, sets the tone for the rest of the album. Neil's husky voice and strumming guitar, backed by Keltner's drumming, immediately takes us on the bumpy ride that is the current socio-political climate. The song speaks for itself- ""There's a battle raging on the Peace Trail."" There's no sugarcoating, just plain and simple truth, the world needs healing.

The second track, Can't Stop Workin', is an electric rocker, with Neil's guitar solo taking center stage. The lyrics are a bit repetitive, but that's the point. It's a testament to Neil's unwavering dedication to his craft.

Indian Givers, the third track, is a powerful protest song, rightfully so. The song was written in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Again, Neil doesn't mince his words, ""I wish somebody would share the news, Now that's it's all over. What's the use of going half way down, Just 'cause everybody's going.""

My Pledge, the fourth track, is a change of pace. It's a heartfelt ballad, with Neil's voice cracking in all the right places. The song's theme is love, and it's refreshing to see Neil come out of his stereotypical protest song persona.

The fifth and sixth tracks are not very memorable. The first one, Glass Accident, is a slow and monotonous song, with not much going on instrumentally. The latter, Terrorist Suicide Hang Gliders, is a bold statement, but something just doesn't click.

The seventh track, John Oaks, brings us back to Neil's wheelhouse- storytelling. It's a beautiful country ballad, with Neil's voice touching your heartstrings. The lyrics describe a friendship between two men who stayed together, even when the world turned on them. It's a beautiful tribute to the power of friendship.

The album closes with the acoustic My New Robot. This song feels like a playful experiment, with Neil taking us on a journey involving robots and Dylan.

In conclusion, ""Peace Trail"" isn't Neil Young's most exemplary album, but it's still a testament to his musical genius. Lyrically, it's brilliant, with Neil not shying away from delivering strong messages. The instrumentals are on point, with Keltner and Bushnell backing Neil impeccably. It's a must-listen for any Neil Young fan and anyone who cares about the current state of the world.","1.

Ratatat,Ratatat,Electronic,8.4,April 27 2004,Loren Ludwig & Jascha Hoffman,,"As French monks discovered centuries ago while under gothic spires, there is nothing like the sweep and pulse of intertwining melodies to lend momentum to music. Their melodic lines would twist along, gathering dissonances that would eventually explode against their rhythms into warm, open intervals. But back in those days, they didn't have drum machines to pull their lines into orbit. Ratatat does, and it gives their music an epic quality that would send any monk into fits of orgiastic glee. Ratatat is a collaboration between lead guitarist Mike Stroud and bedroom producer Evan Mast, with piercing sheets of guitar and synthesizer yoked to a bass-heavy metronomic grid. The project marks a new direction for both musicians: Evan Mast's 2001 debut as E*vax, Parking Lot Music, was a stroll through a collection of debris both sleek and gritty, while Mike was known for ripping it up on stage with Ben Kweller and Dashboard Confessional. With Ratatat, however, the pair establishes a plush, crisp sonic space, and then holds court there for a good three quarters of an hour. Theirs is an imperial presence, somewhere near the crossroads of rock, electronic and hip-hop. Though their songs are pop-length, and each is bound to get stuck in your head, these are not actually songs in the conventional sense. There are no vocals, for one thing, and they grow from point A to point B without looking back over their shoulder for a chorus. While the album is a home studio creation, most of the material begs to strut on stage for a hungry crowd. Indeed, what we have here is a long-awaited stepchild of IDM and hair metal sensibilities, joined by the omnivorous appetite of hip-hop. And Ratatat is hip-hop. For starters, ""Lapland"" and ""Breaking Away"" feature the sort of spacious, head-nodding beats that fuel freestyle fantasies, and recently led the duo to a mixtape collaboration with Wu-Tang's Buddha Monk. The two waifish Crown Heights boys also sprinkle their album with samples of local rap veteran Young Churf, who starts out the album with a sly boast: ""I've been rapping for about 17 years, okay? I don't write my stuff anymore. I just take it from my head..."" So it begins. The opener, ""17 Years"", is heavy artillery singed with the roar and crackle of distorted power chords. But it has a change of heart halfway through, wandering from the guitar-rock battlefield to graze on bittersweet, twilit pastures. ""El Pico"" cultivates a brighter kind of melancholy. Layered with scraping percussion, sweet electric piano figures, wiry synthesizers, and even an old accordion, it sets a tone that somehow manages to be intimate and epic at the same time. Ratatat is also good old-fashioned rock. ""Desert Eagle"" has a sing-songy quality that explains why so many people have been trying to put words to these tunes since Mast and Stroud started performing together as Cherry last year. But if ""Desert Eagle"" promises an indie rock ballad, it soon turns into a towering arena-rock anthem that delivers a healthy dose of Brian May. There is, after all, more than a little Queen in Ratatat's sound, which, when paired with Evan's husky, meticulous beats, results in a surprisingly buoyant thrash that delivers on the promise of early rock/rap crossovers. The duo's debut tends towards harmonic saturation, folding over you with great swaths of guitar and synthesizer. Unsurprisingly, the effect is intensely pleasurable, giving the album a warm and almost amniotic sense of immediacy. But a womb can also be a prison. Despite the risk of claustrophobia, Ratatat keep the oxygen flowing with well-proportioned chord cycles backed by spare, expansive beats. In soaring like a motet yet pounding like cavalry-- or, in modern terms, in ripping like Jimi but bumping like Dre-- Ratatat deliver on the ancient promise that harmony and rhythm, often set against each other in the history of Western music, are really just facets of one another.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6913-ratatat/,XL,2004.0,"If you're a fan of electronic music, then Ratatat's self-titled album is definitely one to add to your collection. With an impressive rating of 8.4 out of 10, it's no surprise that this album definitely delivers.

Let's start with a bit of history about the band. Ratatat is made up of guitarist Mike Stroud and producer Evan Mast, who formed the duo in 2001. Their style is hard to define as it spans electronic rock, experimental, and even world music. They're known for their instrumental tracks, but also experiment with vocals in some of their albums as well.

But let's focus on the album at hand – Ratatat's self-titled album. The creation story behind the album is quite interesting. The duo's previous album, Classics, had been quite successful - but they were eager to create something new and different. Stroud and Mast locked themselves in a small cabin in upstate New York for three months straight, with the sole purpose of creating new music. They brought with them an array of instruments, electronics, and even a gong. The resulting music is what we hear on this album.

Now, let me share my personal experience with this album. As soon as the first track, ""Montanita,"" begins playing, you're immediately transported to another place. The upbeat guitar riffs and electronic beats immediately grab your attention and pull you in. It's the perfect track to start the album off with. As the album progresses, the tracks vary in tempo and mood, but there's a consistency in the overall sound of the album.

One of my personal favorite tracks on the album is ""Loud Pipes."" This was one of the lead singles released prior to the album's drop and it's easy to see why. The catchy guitar riff is so infectious that it's hard to resist dancing along. Another track that stood out to me was ""Germany to Germany."" The haunting melody is a nice change of pace from the more upbeat tracks on the album.

Overall, Ratatat's self-titled album is definitely worth a listen. The combination of electronic beats and guitar riffs create a truly unique sound that's hard not to enjoy. The fact that they created this album after locking themselves in a cabin for three months just adds to the intrigue of the album. It's no wonder it has such a high rating – it's truly a work of art.","1. Review A has a more complex and detailed language compared to Review B, indicating a higher level of writing skill.

Mount Eerie,Black Wooden Ceiling Opening EP,Rock,7.6,May 28 2008,Jessica Suarez,Contributor,"Pacific Northwest musician and artist Phil Elverum, aka Mount Eerie, writes around tactile sensations. In his better incarnation, Microphones, song titles such as ""The Pull"", ""I Felt Your Shape"", ""Ice"", and ""Sand (Eric's Trip)"" conjure elements of motion and texture. Those were songs with seasick dynamics: booms and flicks; hard, lumbering drums; and Elverum's soft voice. Willful amateurism is the other defining characteristic of Elverum's career, in ways both admirable (the care and dedication he shows in packaging and releasing his own material) and silly (this EP comes with a bootleg of the track list, played live, and captured by a tape recorder held up to a PA). Sometimes that amateurism has given off the distinct impression that Elverum's not trying very hard, but he's had plenty of bright spots, too. This release is one of them. Black Wooden Ceiling Opening is the first of Elverum's experiments in ""black metal using natural materials."" Despite his claims to genre-hopping, this six-song EP isn't so different from his other releases. For one thing, three of the tracks have seen light on other albums, though in different forms (something he also attempted in 2005 when he reworked songs on ""Singers""). But even the new tracks fit his discography, though with mealier textures and darker tones. The album's best track is one of the older ones. ""Don't Smoke""-- originally released on a limited 7""-- makes good on its title: Elverum doesn't want you to smoke. Though his argument is sincere, his reasons are a bit flimsy: You smoke because ""there's a little part of you that wants to be dead"" or maybe because ""the rebellion against the adults hasn't ended yet."" The guitar is more furious than his pleas, and it's the tension and crash of the music that make this the EP's standout. ""Blue Light on the Floor"" is another makeover. The first version, from 2007's Mount Eerie Pts. 6 & 7, shimmers and flexes; cymbals and low organ drones ebb and flow behind his voice. The Black Wooden Ceiling Opening version eschews scenery for action and powerful exhales of gut-rumbling distortion. There are some real, menacingly fast intakes of breath from Elverum, too, which reinforce the aggression. And the double-tracked vocals fit the song's muscular makeover more than they do the earlier version, which ends with the same gruff textures that you'll find on Black Wooden Ceiling Opening. Maybe Elverum had planned this version from the beginning. Plain, literal, naked, on closer ""Stop Singing"" Elverum sings: ""If I stopped bellowing my voice in the void/ I would notice songs that all around me sing."" Like a smoker, Elverum's compulsion to keep going trumps his own best interests-- when he recognizes that compulsion is when he's at his best, though his recent output hasn't topped his Microphones work. But Elverum's experiment is less about moving forward than mulling over. Restlessness or laziness, who knows. But as Mount Eerie, he can rework his material in a way that makes it meatier but still tactile, more aggressive yet as emotionally understated and gentle as his voice.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11545-black-wooden-ceiling-opening-ep/,P.W. Elverum & Sun,2008.0,"If you're a fan of experimental rock, Mount Eerie's ""Black Wooden Ceiling Opening EP"" is an album worth giving a listen. With a rating of 7.6 out of 10, it's clear that this album has struck a chord with many listeners, and with good reason.

Before diving into the music itself, it's worth taking a moment to acknowledge Mount Eerie's place in the music world. Frontman Phil Elverum has been making music since the late 1990s, and has been associated with a number of experimental bands and projects, including The Microphones. With Mount Eerie, Elverum has released a number of critically acclaimed albums that defy easy categorization. The music is often marked by hauntingly beautiful instrumentals and lyrics that explore themes of longing, loss, and the natural world.

""Black Wooden Ceiling Opening EP"" is no exception to this trend. The album was released in 2014, and was inspired by a period of time when Elverum found himself holed up in a room with a black wooden ceiling. It's a deeply introspective work, with lyrics that verge on poetry, and instrumentals that are both moody and melodic.

As a listener, it's hard not to get swept up in the emotional landscape that Elverum creates on this album. Tracks like ""Boat"" and ""Black Wooden"" are particularly impactful, with layered instrumentals that build and swell in a way that feels cinematic. There are moments of beauty and moments of pain, and Elverum navigates both with a deft hand.

That being said, ""Black Wooden Ceiling Opening EP"" isn't an easy listen. It's the kind of album that demands your attention, and rewards you for giving it. It's a headphone album, meant to be listened to in the quiet moments of the day, when you're willing to let it wash over you.

Personally, I found ""Black Wooden Ceiling Opening EP"" to be an incredibly moving work. It's not an album I put on during a run or a commute, but rather one I return to when I need a moment to myself. It's an immersive listening experience that invites you to get lost in its world.

Overall, if you're looking for something outside the realm of traditional rock music, ""Black Wooden Ceiling Opening EP"" is a must-listen. It's a testament to the power of experimentation and emotional honesty in music, and a reminder that there's always something new and exciting to discover in the world of music.","1.

The Phenomenal Handclap Band,Form & Control,"Electronic,Pop/R&B",4.2,March 15 2012,Eric Grandy,Contributor,"Disco's resurgence over the past 10 years, in both indie and dance circles, has had everything to do with its rougher and more minimal edges. From the raw punk-funk of early DFA Records to the more recent trend of stripped-down re-edits, bands and producers of the 2000s excised disco's gaudier, more extravagant traits-- diva vocals, symphonic sweeps of strings and brass-- in favor of grooves and attitude. But NYC disco-pop collective the Phenomenal Handclap Band are swimming against the tide, indulging in disco's excesses and 70s lite-AM ambitions. Their sophomore album's title, Form & Control, immediately shows the band's strengths and their weakness: It's a smooth, utterly precise study of the formal elements that make disco and electro-pop tick, but with far too little of the body heat that actually gets that stuff going. Instead, the band delivers various pastiches of disco, electro-funk, and period-appropriate pop with an often frosty and detached air-- the sort of vibe that Ladytron pull off with greater charisma, fresher material, and far stronger songwriting. It's not just the chilly tone that makes PHB's well-crafted grooves fail to ignite, though. It's also the way their songs feel overstuffed, or undecided. With eight people in the band, the temptation to give everybody some, to gild every rhythm with excess layers of vocal harmony and instrumental flourishes must be impossible to resist; the result is songs that don't breathe, disparate parts that rub up against each other and clash as often as they complement, and grooves that don't get the chance to develop to their fullest hypnotic potential. Unsurprisingly, the best tracks here are the simplest and most straightforward: the rubbery bassline and vampy chorus of ""The Right One"", the shushing disco beat and marimba/synth line of ""Give"", neither of which are lost in overly busy arrangements. Conversely, there's ""The Unknown Faces at Father James Park"" (even its title is overstuffed): The verse is one of the most appealing passages on the entire album, the band's female vocalists trading glassy background chants with a deadpan, staccato lead, but the song derails into a technically impressive but momentum-sapping harmonic chorus. Either aspect alone could be stretched and variegated into a fine song, but crammed together they somehow stall. There's a disconnect, like a 5th Dimension or a Polyphonic Spree struggling to break out of the beat. (Another odd 70s touch: Several of the songs end by fading out on a refrain rather than resolving, which can have the effect of making them feel unfinished.) The rift between disco grooves and hippie vocal harmonies plays out on the album level as well. About three-quarters of the way through, the record shifts from dance party to something else: we get the flowery blues funk of ""Afterglow"", the windy, wide-open guitar twang of ""All Cliches"", the light rock (and incongruous sitar) of ""Mirrors,"" and the wan vintage pop of ""The Attempt"". Throw the bombastic, heavy-thudding piano of the title track in here, too. These aren't exactly good songs, but they at least have a sense of purpose. A good disco act makes a six-minute song feel like half that--or better, makes you want to hear it re-edited out to 10 minutes by some reel-to-reel DJ (that this happened with the best song of PHB's last album, ""You'll Disappear"", proves that at least they have some decent beats in them). Hardly a song on Form & Control goes substantially beyond the four-minute mark, and yet the whole album drags. Maybe the answer is to let those inner hippies out, and leave the dancefloor to someone else.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16385-phenomenal-handclap-band-form-control/,Tummy Touch,2012.0,"If you're searching for a fresh and exciting electronic-pop album to add to your playlist, 'Form & Control' by The Phenomenal Handclap Band should definitely be on your radar. With a mix of retro and contemporary electronic and funk sounds, this album serves up an interesting and diverse listening experience. 

The Phenomenal Handclap Band began their musical journey in 2008, and since then, they have been dedicated to achieving a sound that's a unique blend of old and new. They've managed to create a sound that is both nostalgic and modern, which could be attributed to their diverse musical backgrounds. Each member of the band brings something different to the table, which makes their music truly stand out.

'Form & Control' was released in 2012 and it's clear that the band took special care with every track on the album. The album's creation story is just as noteworthy as the music itself - the band actually took a break before beginning work on this album to better understand themselves and their musical journey. As a result, 'Form & Control' feels like an album that was carefully crafted with love and care.

As soon as the album begins, it's clear that the band has been successful in creating a unique sound. The opening track, ""Following"" is an upbeat and energetic tune with a funky bassline and infectious chorus that's impossible not to dance to. From there, the album takes you on a journey through various musical styles and influences - from the dreamy ""The Written Word"" to the soulful ""Winter Falls"" and the upbeat and playful ""Mirrors"". 

Overall, the album is a solid effort, but it's not perfect. While the band has achieved a unique sound, some of the tracks on the album feel like they don't quite hit the mark. Additionally, some of the electronic beats feel repetitive and stale. However, there are definitely standout tracks that make the album worth listening to, including ""Form & Control"", ""The Unknown Faces at Father James Park"" and ""Afterglow"".

In conclusion, 'Form & Control' is an album worth checking out if you're looking for something different from the usual electronic-pop offerings. While it's not without its flaws, there are definitely enough standout moments on the album to make it worth coming back to. The Phenomenal Handclap Band is a group of talented musicians who have managed to create a unique sound that's both nostalgic and modern.","1.

Missy Elliott,This Is Not a Test,Rap,8.5,December 3 2003,Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,"This is a Brent DiCrescenzo exclusive. Readers'd revolt if I began every review that way. Unfortunately, Missy Elliott did just that on last year's Under Construction, proclaiming the unnecessary before each track. It's nitpicking criticism, but enough reason to proclaim dark, dense This Is Not a Test as the new, and likely temporary, Best Missy Elliott Album. Time has come to examine the cultural idiosyncrasies of Virginia and discover how the region produced the core clique of pop innovators. With attention focused on New York, Manchester, Miami, and even Seattle, the notion sounded preposterous a decade ago. Now entrenched as the Ronnie and Phil of crunk, Missy and Timbaland need only compete against their past, and the occasional Neptunes track. As in any healthy muse/artist relationship, the producer reserves his next level work for the queen. The sparse scratch and siren driven ""Let It Bump"" hits speakers like a SWAT team on a motel door. The broken-cone bass buzz and snapping steel guitar string supersaturates ""Pump It Up"" with sickness. There's no way these beats were going to Kiley Dean or Magoo. Nothing in the world rattles jeeps more than war and hip-hop. Surrounded by a Hummer, Black Panthers, bull terriers, and a burnt sky, Missy looks ready to meld the two. In this current climate, such imagery comes obviously loaded, yet she abstains from any referential iconography, such as Madonna's Che chic, or manifesto. Songs like ""Let Me Fix My Weave"" and the dildo ode ""Toyz"" throw no stones at administrations or pseudo-pundits (though I suspect Condi is quite familiar with both subjects). The imagery evokes Missy's unabashed forthrightness and Timbaland's accompanying steely, spiked clamor. A verse on ""Weave"" levels J.Lo's extensions with the common lady getting her hair ""did,"" Missy's table at Madre's be damned. No veils of cute or coy or irony are pulled before her faÃ§ade. Timbaland laces no trendy bhangra or dancehall into his minimal assaults, even those on which Elephant/Beenie Man guest. Video vixens may pant and rub themselves to stumps before approaching the true sexuality of a woman who's run out of patience for those refusing to dance, drop their posturing, or go down on her. But it's the album's end-to-end strength that speaks the most-- against hip-hop artists who fail to make solid albums and those rock idiots who say it can't be done. 16 tracks clock in under 60 minutes with meaningful mini-skits, intro, and outros. Even the plethora of guests inconspicuously slip into the mix. There's no way the two stars could be outshined, though Nelly redeems his crassly commercial career with his ""go go Gadget dick,"" while Jay-Z brilliantly rhymes ""rectum"" with ""David Beckham"" on ""Wake Up"". As that track crushes like a submarine hull crunching over sonar pings, Missy says, ""You ain't got a cellular phone/ It's all right/ If you gotta wear them jeans again/ It's all right."" Even when backed up by the Kings of Bling, Missy continually cuts the crap. Everyone is invited to the party, even those getting dissed. Those familiar with Missy through the radio only need know this: even the skyscraping ""Pass That Dutch"", a masterwork of robot ropeskipping riding unbelievably deep bass that turns subwoofers into hair dryers, seems a mere hillock over its surroundings.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2758-this-is-not-a-test/,Elektra,2003.0,"Let me start this review by saying that Missy Elliott's latest album, ""This Is Not a Test,"" is a true testament to the evolution of rap music. With its upbeat sound, catchy lyrics and polished production, it's no surprise that it has already received numerous accolades from fans and critics alike.

For those of you who are not familiar with Missy Elliott's music, she has been a leading figure in the rap world for over two decades. She first burst onto the scene in the mid-90s as a member of the hip-hop group Sista, before branching out as a solo artist in 1997 with her debut album ""Supa Dupa Fly."" Since then, she has released a string of hit albums, won countless awards (including four Grammys), and collaborated with some of the biggest names in the industry.

In ""This Is Not a Test,"" Missy Elliott showcases her versatility as both a rapper and a singer, seamlessly blending her flow with melodic hooks. The album features collaborations with some of the biggest names in the music industry, including Pharrell Williams, Christina Aguilera, and Timbaland. It's clear from the tracklist that Missy Elliott is not afraid to experiment with different sounds and styles, making for a dynamic listening experience.

One of my personal favorites from the album is ""WTF (Where They From),"" which features Pharrell Williams. It's an infectious track that combines a funky beat with Missy Elliott's signature rapid-fire flow. Another standout track is ""Pep Rally,"" which has a cheerleader chant as its hook and an infectious beat that makes you want to dance.

Aside from the catchy beats and clever lyrics, what sets Missy Elliott apart from other rappers is her ability to empower listeners through her music. Her lyrics often touch upon themes of self-love, empowerment, and gender equality. In ""This Is Not a Test,"" she tackles these themes head-on, particularly in tracks like ""Cool Off"" and ""Strive,"" which encourage listeners to strive for success and never give up.

Overall, ""This Is Not a Test"" is an impressive addition to Missy Elliott's already impressive discography. It's a testament to her status as a pioneering figure in the rap world and serves as proof that rap music is still evolving and pushing boundaries. With its catchy beats, empowering lyrics, and all-star collaborations, it's no wonder it has received so much critical acclaim. I would give it a rating of 8.5 out of 10 and highly recommend it to any rap fan or music lover looking for a fresh and dynamic listening experience.","1.

William Parker,Raining on the Moon,Jazz,8.4,August 20 2002,Chris Dahlen,,"We argue now and then around the 'Fork office about whether or not ""jazz is dead."" My take: it's not, and Thirsty Ear's Blue Series is the evidence. Despite the genre's recent bout with hard times, its artists-- from Matthew Shipp, to John Zorn, to David S. Ware, to William Parker-- continue to merge new ideas with new technology, breaking many of the old laws of conventional jazz while still adhering to its base policies. With the ground broken by these artists in recent years, jazz, at least in the underground, is finding a new audience, and even enjoying something of a renaissance-- Blue Series curator Matthew Shipp broke records when, earlier this year, his Nu-Bop LP became the first album ever to debut at #1 on CMJ's college charts. The Blue Series is tailor-made to grab new listeners and convince that jazz is alive and doing damn well, thanks very much, with releases showcasing this new, boundary-pushing jazz music. William Parker and Matthew Shipp, in particular, have anchored many releases that take the best living improvisers and throw in something 'extra'-- sometimes a DJ, sometimes an programmer/electronics guy, or in this case, a singer. On Raining on the Moon, Parker's quartet-- with Louis Barnes on trumpet, Rob Brown on alto and flute, and the extremely simpatico Hamid Drake on drums-- is joined by Leena Conquest, who sings Parker's lyrics with a deep, compelling voice. Like Parker's bass, Conquest's vocals fluctuate between the bold and the yearning, always reaching for the fantastic from a deep-rooted center. And what she reveals about his vision makes this album as essential as his other recent projects, as well as a fine place for beginners to start exploring, as it's probably the most accessible. William Parker pursues spirituality through hard work. He plays bass as if reaching heaven is a matter of steadily, repeatedly knocking until someone opens the door; he's one of the avant-garde jazz players most dedicated to the pursuit of higher purpose and heightened awareness in music, and he approaches it with a heavy, elemental tone. His poetry, which he has rarely recorded, has the same character: it's full of images that emerge steadily and deliberately, using simple words to evoke rich colors and sounds. Take, for example, these lines from ""Song of Hope"": ""I have a rag doll filled with light and when I squeeze it the world gets brighter and brighter.../ I clap my hands and birds fill trees with sweet melodies."" On the album's centerpiece, the ambling, fourteen-minute title track, Conquest sings about an America turned upside down. Every wrong is corrected: the Native Americans take the presidency, and ""the White House is now the Red House""; Columbus Day is off the calendar; millionaires hand their money to the poor. It's a great riff, slowly growing more serious and pseudo-Biblical when everyone who's been lynched comes back to life. The victims forgive their killers: ""If you knew what you did you'd be evil... and I know you're not evil."" The song swells and rises, yet it never erupts or loses balance: Parker and Drake stay the course, Parker's tone sounding like a man moving heavy furniture while Drake's hi-hats shuffle around him. On two tracks, Parker plays an African Harp called the 'donso ngoni,' and echoes the reflectiveness of the New York loft jazz sound; there are also two instrumentals, the bright ""Hunk Pappa Blues"" and the ballad ""Old Tears,"" where Barnes and Brown stretch out beyond the commentary and interjections given to the other tracks. The album generally sticks with a strident, determined tone, with echoes of 60s and 70s protest music-- Conquest often evokes the spirit of, say, Abbey Lincoln on Max Roach's Freedom Now Suite-- yet the lyrics don't signify opposition so much as they dream of alternatives: a better world, more justice, watermelons that grow on trees... These are wild visions, but they sure seem real, and even attainable, when Conquest sings of them.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6173-raining-on-the-moon/,Thirsty Ear,2002.0,"If you're a jazz enthusiast, then you're likely already familiar with William Parker, the highly acclaimed double bassist and improviser. Parker's latest album, ""Raining on the Moon,"" provides listeners with a remarkable tour de force of the sensibilities and aesthetics that have made him one of the major figures in contemporary jazz.

The album, which has a rating of 8.4 out of 10, is a prime example of how jazz can take listeners on a transformative journey, filled with unexpected turns and nuances that can be thoroughly engaging. ""Raining on the Moon's"" contemporary jazz stylings are the result of Parker's decades-long career as a bandleader, composer, and improviser. With this album, he brings a refreshingly current take on the genre.

One of the things that make ""Raining on the Moon"" so remarkable is the impressive history that William Parker brings to the table. Throughout his career, Parker has collaborated with the who's who of jazz. He's played alongside luminaries such as Cecil Taylor, Ed Blackwell, and David S. Ware, just to name a few. Additionally, he has served as the bandleader for ensembles such as the Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra and his Raining on the Moon Sextet. This background has given Parker an unparalleled depth of musical knowledge that is evident in each of the tracks on ""Raining on the Moon.""

The creation story of this album is no less impressive. The tracks on ""Raining on the Moon"" were recorded over four days in Brooklyn in May of 2001. Parker was accompanied by his trusted sextet, which featured musicians like Lewis Barnes on trumpet, Rob Brown on alto sax, and Hamid Drake on drums, among others. The four-day session was a unique experience, with Parker employing a technique he called ""communal composition,"" in which each member of the sextet played a key role in the creation of the music.

As a jazz lover, I found ""Raining on the Moon"" to be an enthralling auditory experience. Each track is well-thought-out and balanced, with a keen attention to detail. Parker's use of ""communal composition"" makes the sound of the album highly complex and layered, making it a delightful listen for those who appreciate challenging jazz compositions. The album has its fair share of moments of tranquility as well, with tracks like ""Morning Mantra"" welcoming the listener in with its meditative quality.

Overall, ""Raining on the Moon"" is a must-listen for anyone interested in contemporary jazz. The album's history, creation story, and the sheer depth of its musicality will leave you mesmerized, no matter what your level of familiarity with jazz is. If you're looking for an album that is both highly technical and highly emotional, then look no further than William Parker's ""Raining on the Moon.""","1.

Vattnet Viskar,Sky Swallower,Metal,8.0,September 4 2013,Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,"When Brandon Stosuy interviewed Chris Alfieri, co-founder and guitarist for the New Hampshire metal band Vattnet Viskar, last year, he asked what the band's name-- Swedish for ""the water whispers""-- meant  to them.

The reverence and the lyric note in his voice provide some insight into the band's awe-inspiring, violently gorgeous first full-length, Sky Swallower. The album starts in the recognizable, misty-forest environs of early Scandinavian black metal: Opener ""New Alchemy"" bludgeons with the familiar all-sixteenths assault of guitars, drums, and bass, and the riff is a close harmonic cousin of Darkthrone's ""Transilvanian Hunger"". But after a few minutes of this locked spiral, the grip slackens, the drumming relaxes into eighth notes, then quarters, before the song yawns open into droning doom metal. By the end, ""Alchemy"" has receded further into glimmering, clean-toned guitar notes and lightly syncopated drum fills, and we're no  longer in any one place: Vattnet have already stormed across acres of territory. They rage and mourn across this massive open space for the next 32 minutes, and by the time the album has reached the regally chilly final track ""Apex"", you, too, can see the ocean from the mountains. Like many other American metal bands (Inter Arma, Deafheaven, Woe, and Castevet, for example), Vattnet Viskar are stylistic nomads; in a field where every choice of drum beat is loaded with fiercely specific, coded information, they pluck useful stuff from wherever they find it. The middle-distance savagery of metalgaze, dour instrumental rock, the shuddering churn of doom metal-- Vattnet Viskar swallow it all, all usually within the space of the same song. The expansive power chords opening the short instrumental ""Monarch"" could be from Arkansas doom outfit Pallbearer, though when Nick Thornbury sings on the following track, ""Breath of the Almighty, his voice is harsh and guttural and wet-sounding in a way more reminiscent of death than black metal-- you can hear individual spit bubbles pop and gurgle in back of his throat. The band's full attack has a similarly muscular ugliness to it, a visceral sound that can shrink suddenly pinhole-quiet. In his Show No Mercy interview, Alfieri also talked about how hard the band thought about long-form structure-- peaks, dynamics, threading themes through a composition. This kind of under-the-hood point-plotting rarely sounds sexy, but you can feel it, even without an iota of musical training, coursing beneath Sky Swallower's 38 minutes, whispering beneath the roar. There are a few stunning moments on Sky Swallower when everything drops away: Midway through ""Breath of the Almighty"" for instance, the band dissipates after three or so minutes and nothing is left but two strings of guitar and a bass. The moment hangs, darkening, for several minutes, echoing a similar, earlier interlude in ""Fog of Apathy"". The last sound on the album is a lone acoustic, strumming two chords-- the lingering note of sadness, maybe that pulses beneath Sky Swallower, trailing off.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18504-vattnet-viskar-sky-swallower/,Century Media,2013.0,"Today, we will be delving into the immersive and intense world of Vattnet Viskar, as we explore their 2013 album 'Sky Swallower', a groundbreaking piece of music that has cemented its place among the Metal community as an iconic release. This album is a tour-de-force of impassioned melodies, monstrous riffs, and cathartic vocals that cut through the soul like a hot knife through butter. It is an unyielding example of what Metal can be when its creators are not content with playing it safe.

Before we dive into the music, a brief history lesson is needed to understand the band's place in the Metal world. Vattnet Viskar is a Black Metal outfit hailing from the depths of New Hampshire, USA, formed in 2010. They self-released their debut EP 'Demophon' in 2011. Soon after, they signed a deal with Century Media Records, which led to the creation of 'Sky Swallower.' At the time of release, the band had a reasonable following, but their popularity exploded with this album's release, and they became a household name among Metal enthusiasts worldwide.

The album's creation story is an interesting one, and it is worth taking a moment to examine the themes and influences that inspired the band's creative process. 'Sky Swallower' deals with themes of mortality, loss, and despair, and it takes us on a journey through the darkest recesses of the human psyche. The band drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including literature, art, and music. The album's title, for instance, is a nod to Norse mythology, where the sky was believed to be a giant's skull, and the stars were said to be the holes in its skull.

Now, let's talk about the music. 'Sky Swallower' is a dark and desolate landscape that captures the listener's attention from the very first note. The album opens with 'New Alchemy,' a sprawling instrumental that sets the tone for what is to come. It brings to mind images of ancient ruins, forgotten tombs, and bleak landscapes. The album's second track, 'Fog of Apathy,' is a testament to the band's technical abilities. It's a perfect blend of Black Metal and Doom Metal, featuring intricate guitar work that is both melodic and dissonant. The vocals on this track are gut-wrenching, and they convey a sense of despair that is hard to ignore.

'Sky Swallower' is not an easy album to listen to. It is raw, emotional, and challenging, but it is also incredibly rewarding. The album's standout tracks include 'Breath of the Almighty,' a slow-burning epic that builds to a crescendo of blazing guitars and pained vocals. 'Mythos' is another highlight, featuring a catchy and memorable chorus that will stay with you long after the song has ended. The album closes with 'Apex,' a fitting conclusion to the themes explored throughout the album. It's a slow, brooding track that leaves you feeling emotionally drained but also fulfilled.

In conclusion, 'Sky Swallower' by Vattnet Viskar is a masterpiece of Modern Metal. It is an album that demands your attention, and it rewards your investment with a sonic experience that transcends genre boundaries. The band's technical prowess, combined with their emotional intensity, creates an album that is both memorable and challenging. It is an album that reminds us of the power of music, to transport us to places we never knew existed and to provide solace in the darkest of times. If you are a Metal fan, this album should be part of your collection; if not, it could be an excellent gateway into one of the most captivating genres of music. I give this album an 8.0 out of 10.","1. Review A provides a detailed description of the band's name and its meaning, while Review B does not mention it at all.

Earth,The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull,Metal,7.7,February 29 2008,Zach Baron,,"Earth's ""Miami Morning Coming Down II (Shine)"" is a steady, sedate, chiming march, a primary-colored burst of guitars, organs, drums. For a man whose scuzzy, Melvins-mainlined Earth 2 remains the document for drone-and doom-minded depressives-- some of whom actually named their bands after Earth songs/guitar equipment-- Dylan Carlson's return as the Ennio Morricone of metal continues to confound. The band that borrowed their name from Sabbath's earliest, nuclear-paranoid incarnation have become optimists, purveyors of uplift. Where Earth once pounded chords flat, the newly reconfigured quartet pulls them out like taffy. ""Miami Morning Coming Down"" nods at Johnny Cash, spaghetti twang, gospel hymns; even Carlson's newest title, The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull, turns his band's fearsome reputation inside out, offering up metal's ubiquitous skull as the birthplace of something sweet. Earth's hiatus, from 1996 to 2002, turned Carlson into a cult figure, and his return was fretted about by the acolytes he'd picked up while he was gone. Sunn0))), Boris, and Sleep had turned Carlson's sound into a movement-- a slow one, to be sure-- waiting eagerly for his return. Perversely, he came back with 2005's Hex, or Printing in the Infernal Method instead, a demoniacally glacial deconstruction of the post-rock twang that had abounded in his absence. Hex was heavy in the sense that it kept time even as Carlson meandered and detoured and wandered through melodic progressions so spaced out they sounded like jazz; one thing it definitely wasn't was Sunn0))). Carlson's concept for Bees was even more abstract. ""After we did Hex, we thought, 'Let's do a kind of gospel record,'"" Carlson told Pitchfork last year. Perhaps Carlson just meant strength in numbers: Bees is probably the most band-oriented thing Carlson's ever done, as much about drummer Adrienne Davies and organist Steve Moore as Carlson's guitar lines, which for the first time were added not first but last. The result is an imperceptible relay between keys, guitars, bass, and drums, with any given melodic line handed off three or four times in the course of a song. Over time, the parts stay the same, the instruments change, and time slows down-- after a while, the songs shrink down to exact moments, static pictures that morph so gradually you never spot the change. Still, Bees is the biggest, cleanest, and most flagrantly melodic record Earth's ever recorded. ""Omens and Portents I: The Driver"" has the kind of mildly ominous, lazily distorted tone that soaks Beach House records, while ""Omens and Portents II: Carrion Crow"" offers up the exact same five-note ascending harmony as the Microphones' ""I Love it So Much!"" It's left to Davies to provide the weight: ""I've always noticed that it's hard to get your playing down towards where your heartbeat is... It's all about keeping your heartbeat down, for me,"" she told Pitchfork. Carlson's always played slow, but six years of playing with Davies (and touring with bassist Don McGreevy) has given every Earth improv the same massive feel of doomy inevitability. Even as Carlson opens up, and looks up, Davies keeps his compositions anchored to the ground. But what melodies. ""Engine of Ruin"" deadpans a kind of flat keyboard line which Carlson expands, alternately following along and filling in, stalking down every harmonic permutation. ""Miami Morning Coming Down"" has probably Carlson's purest and most ravishing pattern ever, a trebly rise and fall that triggers nostalgia, sunrise, sunset, panic, elation, resignation. For a heavy record, Bees spends a lot of time just staring into space, thinking. When Earth started, in 1990, it was an oddball project among friends; Carlson was better known for being pals with an aspiring musician named Kurt Cobain than he was for being one in his own right. In a way, Bees feels as quixotic as anything he was doing then: where once he spent his days stripping down Sabbath to a single ringing chord, now he's stripping chords for parts. Amazingly, the results are just as huge. Who knew you could do so much so slowly?",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11218-the-bees-made-honey-in-the-lions-skull/,Southern Lord,2008.0,"Hello, fellow music lovers! I had the pleasure of listening to Earth's album 'The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull' and I must say, it's a unique and captivating piece of work. For those unfamiliar with Earth, they are an American band founded in 1989 by guitarist Dylan Carlson. The band's style has shifted over the years from doom metal to experimental and ambient music.

In this album, Earth explores the world of metal with their interpretation of the genre. 'The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull' was released in 2008 and received a positive reception from both critics and fans. This album is not your typical metal sound, but rather a blend of experimental rock, drone, and even Western themes.

The creation story behind this album is rather interesting. Dylan Carlson took inspiration from the book ""The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull"" by Swiss writer Frank Brunner. Carlson described the book as ""an ode to finding beauty in places where you're not supposed to find it."" He also drew inspiration from the works of Ennio Morricone, a famous Italian composer.

Listening to this album, you can definitely hear the Western influence in the music. The opening track, ""Omens and Portents I: The Driver,"" transports you to a dusty desert setting with its slow guitar riffs and simple drum beats. The use of brass instruments also adds to the Western feel of the album. ""Engine of Ruin"" has a more melancholic tone, with its haunting guitar melodies and subdued drums.

One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Miami Morning Coming Down II (Shine)."" This song starts off with a simple acoustic guitar riff that builds up to an explosion of sound. The use of distortion and reverb on the guitar creates an otherworldly ambiance that is both eerie and beautiful.

Overall, I would give this album a rating of 7.7 out of 10. While not my usual genre of music, I found 'The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull' to be a refreshing and unique experience. Earth has created an album that blends genres and styles flawlessly, creating an immersive listening experience. If you're a fan of experimental rock or drone music, I highly recommend giving this album a spin. Happy listening!","1.

Mac Miller,Blue Slide Park,Rap,1.0,December 8 2011,Jordan Sargent,Contributor,"At the 2000 VMAs, Eminem's performance of ""The Real Slim Shady"" featured him walking across Sixth Avenue in Manhattan and into Radio City Music Hall followed by a few hundred extras that had been styled in his image, bleached hair and all. The performance was an arresting, and very literal, visual representation of the song's claim of there being ""a million of us just like me."" Pittsburgh rapper Mac Miller is having his ""'The Real Slim Shady' at the VMAS"" moment right now, even if he'll never actually perform there. There are hundreds of thousands of listeners trailing him intensely-- Blue Slide Park sold just about 145,000 copes in its first week in stores, making it the first independently distributed debut album to go No. 1 in 16 years. And the reason Miller's mass of fans follow him is not because of his music, at least not completely. It's because he looks just like them, because they can see themselves up on the stage behind him, if not next to him. It's a presumptive conclusion, but it's hard to find much, if anything, in Miller's music that suggests otherwise. He is an outsider, but he brings no outsider's perspective to his music. Forget Eminem, Miller's point of view is less unique than Asher Roth's or Childish Gambino's. He lusts after fame, money, and women, and he smokes weed and parties. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with that; it is rap music, of course. But it does raise the question of why Miller is so popular, because despite his claim of being a cross between John Lennon and UGK, he's mostly just a crushingly bland, more intolerable version of Wiz Khalifa without the chops, desire, or pocketbook for enjoyable singles. Unless you buy into Miller's persona-- and why would you?-- Blue Slide Park offers you nothing that you can't find done more much artfully by, say, Curren$y. This is, in a way, rap music's fault. Mac Miller has been called ""frat rap,"" and while there's a slight truth to that, the term leaves unacknowledged the fact that frat guys used to engage with the rap world writ large. That interaction may have involved an unhealthy appreciation for Jurassic 5, but it also involved rocking YoungbloodZ and Ying Yang Twins songs at parties. The pop world has left rap behind, save four or five rappers, and it's opened a door for someone like Mac Miller to seize the college-aged, white-male fanbase. If that fanbase is interacting less with rap music, then maybe they've rallied around Miller because he also barely engages with the wider rap world. Consider the fact that Blue Slide Park has not one feature-- not a guest verse or chorus. For a contemporary rap album, let alone a No. 1 rap album, that is basically unheard-of. Before you consider that to be a noble pursuit, the album could've used somebody, anybody, to break up the monotony of Miller on the mic. Miller's world is a hermetic one, and unless it's one you inhabit, the album holds no appeal. It's a normal rap album, sure, but as listeners we should strive for more than a no-stakes work by a guy wearing the same streetwear brands and snapbacks as everyone else, who has merely found a niche and exploited it. Miller's hustle can't be knocked, and it shouldn't be, but his art is 144,487 times less remarkable than his first week sales numbers would have you believe. His success is not a mirage, no. But it is a projection.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16113-blue-side-park/,Rostrum,2011.0,"If there's one thing we can all agree on, it's that Mac Miller's debut studio album 'Blue Slide Park' was a controversial piece of work. The Pittsburgh rapper entered the music scene in 2011 with this project, which was largely criticized for its perceived lack of substance and depth. But even as a rap album, 'Blue Slide Park' is one that deserves some attention for its laid-back beats and catchy hooks.

Before the album's release, Mac Miller had already established a sizable following through his earlier mixtapes, and even while being an independent artist. He had a unique ability to make relatable music through his raw and introspective lyrics. Given the success of his mixtapes, it was only fitting that his first studio album was hotly anticipated. Contrary to expectations though, 'Blue Slide Park' was a collection of endlessly upbeat and carefree tracks that left fans and critics scratching their heads.

But let's dive into the actual sound and content of the album. The title track, ""Blue Slide Park,"" is an ode to the playground where Miller spent his childhood, and sets the tone for the whole album. The tempo is breezy, and Miller's flow is relaxed but confident. The verses alternate between stories about his humble beginnings and the everyday activities he enjoys, such as hanging out with friends or smoking weed. It's a very stripped-down track, but it's also one of the album's most charming.

""Party On Fifth Ave"" is a perfect summer party anthem, with a driving beat and catchy hook. As the second single off the album, this track showcases Miller's ability to create infectious tunes that get stuck in your head for days. ""Frick Park Market"" is another standout track, showcasing Miller's lyrical prowess as he raps about his neighborhood and personal experiences.

The album as a whole has a cohesive sound - upbeat, playful, and light-hearted. However, it's undeniable that 'Blue Slide Park' lacks substance in its lyrical content. While it's clear that Miller is having a blast on these tracks, the songs lack the required substance to make it an album that stands the test of time.

Overall, 'Blue Slide Park' is a ride, perhaps not a particularly memorable one, but still one that should not be dismissed entirely. In the grand scheme of things, it's not the kind of project that leaves a lasting impression, but it's still fun to listen to Miller's early efforts and see how far he has come since then. While it may not be the strongest debut album, it's certainly not the worst in rap history. At the end of the day, it's still an enjoyable and easy listen, scoring a 5 out of 10, for the youthful carefree vibe it brings.","1. Review A is longer than Review B.

Brendan Benson and the Wellfed Boys,Metarie EP,,5.9,August 27 2003,Dominique Leone,Contributor,"Woe to power-pop, and to any pop that treads the golden-glittery road paved by mythical British archetypes and downright ancient American high society types. Of all the various strains of would-be rock and roll music, truly it is most often damned from the start: Badfinger knew it, The Raspberries knew it, Curt Boettcher found out, XTC stood alone in the corner as Cheap Trick went to the bank, The dB's broke up as The Rembrandts showed us just how to pigeonhole an entire genre in ten days. Why does this happen? Is it because power-pop is ultimately an exercise of men (and Aimee Mann) trying to be boys? Is it because the world can only handle so much falsetto? Is it because the notion of compact, tightly constructed pop songs performed by people with guitars doesn't make it past the 10 a.m. meeting in a world expecting today's deliverables yesterday? I've never figured out why rock bands playing in the mold of The Beatles, Beach Boys and, well, Cole Porter haven't been more popular. Aren't those guys supposed to be the greatest ever? Perhaps part of the problem is that the general public can't really be bothered with the next generation when they think they've already seen the best episodes. In any case, California-sunned singer/songwriter (ouch, that label has to be at least half the problem) Brendan Benson is pressing on. His 2002 sophomore full-length, Lapalco was moderately well-received by your fave online music hotspot, and judging by the company he keeps (Jason Faulkner... um, Dan Castellaneta-- hey, don't diss his record until you've heard it. Okay, now you can diss it) you'd think he'd at least have some kind of cult following. His tunes should be right on time for fans of Faulkner, Mann and 90s next-spilt-thing Jellyfish. Metarie is an EP (that for all intents and purposes is really an extended single) featuring new versions of two songs from Lapalco, one new tune and a cover of Paul McCartney's ""Let Me Roll It"". Like most good power-pop, the band (a new one for Benson, featuring mainly members of fellow nice guys The Atomic Numbers) sounds good and the background vocals even better. Consequently, Benson's leads are semi-exposed as being a tad thin to carry his songs, which isn't unprecedented (Ben Folds, please stand up) but is disappointing for anyone wanting a little more power in their pop. ""Alternative to Love"" is almost straight Friends fare disguised in Rubber Souls. ""Maybe I'm just damaged goods.../ Me, I'm just a little lost lamb,"" are Benson's admissions, and that places him squarely in the realm of cute li'l underdog. Again, anyone paying even marginal attention to power-pop over the years shouldn't be surprised, though playing that same face through the otherwise faithful version of ""Let Me Roll It"" (one of McCartney's grittier Wings-era outings) drastically undersells its charm. Metarie is probably a stopgap release, and one that probably shouldn't be given microscopic focus by fans. Still, I keep rooting for those damn underdogs, and it would be nice to see one show a little muscle now and then. ",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/654-metarie-ep/,StarTime,2003.0,"Let me tell you about Brendan Benson and the Wellfed Boys' latest offering, the Metarie EP. As a longtime fan of the band's unique brand of nan music, I was excited to dive into their newest project.

For those unfamiliar with Benson and his crew, they've been making music for over two decades now, spanning multiple genres and collaborations. Benson himself is a singer-songwriter known for his introspective lyrics and catchy melodies, while the Wellfed Boys add a groovy, experimental vibe to the mix.

The Metarie EP was born out of a spontaneous jam session, captured on tape and later refined in the studio. You can really hear the organic energy in these tracks, especially in opener ""Sweetest Lie"". The guitar riffs are infectiously upbeat, while Benson's vocals call to mind a mix between John Mayer and Jeff Buckley.

As the EP progresses, we get a taste of the band's more experimental side. ""Dizzy Heights"" takes a more ambient approach with its swirling synths and laid-back tempo, while ""Foolish Heart"" is a funky, bass-heavy jam that showcases the band's tight musicianship.

While I thoroughly enjoyed the Metarie EP, I have to admit that it's not my favorite output from the band. The songs are solid and well-crafted, but they lack the sense of innovation and risk-taking that made me fall in love with Benson's music in the first place. The EP also feels a bit too short, leaving me wanting more.

Overall, I'd give the Metarie EP a solid 7 out of 10. It's a fun and engaging listen that showcases the band's tight musicianship and Benson's ear for melody, but ultimately lacks the depth and vision of their earlier work.

Suarasama,Fajar Di Atas Awan,Rock,7.2,September 22 2008,Joshua Klein,,"The internet may be diminishing, if not outright destroying, the notion of obscurity. But from Alan Lomax to the folks at Sublime Frequencies, as long as there's someone driven enough to seek out new sounds, there will always be new sounds waiting to be discovered. The celestial jukebox is nowhere near full. Even Drag City has been on a global kick lately, via its Yaala Yaala imprint. Now comes the indie's reissue of Suarasama's 1998 Radio France Internationale debut Fajar Di Atas Awan, which is labeled a Drag City proper release. The disc could pass for something from (the Drag City-distributed) Language of Stone, or even another enigmatic project featuring D.C. house band staples Will Oldham and Matt Sweeney. But the passing resemblance of Suarasama's music to oft-cited psych or weird folk figures demonstrates that discovery works both ways. Just as music listeners in the West have spent the past several decades digging up strange, exotic sounds from the East, so are musicians in the East constantly discovering and digesting music made in the West, and from the rest of the world as well. Led by the husband-and-wife team of Irwansyah Harahap (he writes the songs) and Rithaony Hutajulu (she sings, mostly), the Indonesian group draws as much from Central and Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East as it does from its Sumatran heritage, the result being a music particularly free, open, and intriguingly rootless. The album title translates to ""dawn over clouds,"" and the music does reflect that heavenly (or, more broadly, spiritual) imagery. With compositions that rarely fall short of the seven-minute mark, and one that runs twice that, the group's songs are given room to stretch and breathe, achieving a certain inner peace that overcomes whatever cultural or language barriers might keep people from connecting with them. The secret to the album's serenity may lie in its origins. Fajar Di Atas Awan was apparently born as a live RFI broadcast and reportedly never intended for official release, which may explain the relaxed pacing and loose arrangements, built as they typically are out of simple guitar or gambus patterns and embellished with only the barest hints of percussion and other peripheral elements. The results are frequently too gentle to be outright stunning, but engagingly euphonious all the same. This is patient music, never in a hurry to get anywhere in particular, yet all the more impactful when it finally reaches its destination. Tracks such as ""Sang Hyang Guru"" and ""Fajar Di Atas Awan"" are as meditative as the most ""out"" folk, while ""Habibullah"" and ""Zapin Rindu"" capture something slightly more celebratory. ""Lebah"" and ""Zapin Rindu"" are tinged with sadness and solemnity. And listening to a song such as ""Merangkai Warna"" for 14 minutes, the track may as well last 40 minutes, or 400 minutes, or 400 years. While any epiphanies are ultimately in the ear of the beholder, there's no question that the group is reaching for something bigger than itself, searching beyond borders in all directions and dimensions for spiritual truth by way of melody.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12218-fajar-di-atas-awan/,"RFI France,RFI France",1998.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have the utmost pleasure of introducing to you Suarasama's latest album: Fajar Di Atas Awan. This rock album deserves a 7.2 out of 10 rating, but don't let that mediocre score fool you. Fajar Di Atas Awan is a stunning album that showcases Suarasama's creativity and musical prowess in all its glory.

Suarasama is a five-piece rock band from the land of Indonesia. The group consists of Hanny D. Wondaboy (vocals/guitar), Yusmario Farabi (guitar), Okka Pribadi (bass), Danang Joedo (drums), and Yani Maryani (keys). Suarasama became one of Indonesia's most critical and commercially successful bands. This new album's creation was born from a sense of urgency inspired by Indonesia's sociopolitical state. The band teaming up with veteran music producer Harlan Boer, they set out to create a socially charged album.

From the opening track of the album, 'Deru Debu,' Suarasama creates a calm and atmospheric mood with the use of ambient sounds and a slow tempo. Notably, the first track's lyrics shed light on the economic and environment struggles faced by the common people of Indonesia. As the album unfolds, the tempo steadily increases, and the instrumental layering becomes more intricate.

On the third track, 'Fajar Di Atas Awan,' which is the album's title track, begins with a slow build-up before breaking into a frenzied guitar solo. The song's lyrics, which talk about the awakening of the people and their unity to make a change, are uplifting and relevant to the current social climate.

'Kita Manusia,' the fourth track, has a pulsating and hypnotic bassline that provides a perfect groove to compliment the powerful message of unity among humans regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity. The song has been on repeat on my playlist for some time-it's just that good!

One of the standout tracks of the album is 'Parade Petani,' the sixth track. Its instrumentation contains intricate guitar solos, and the drums are booming with precise timing. The lyrics portray the struggles of Indonesian farmers who have been marginalized and are bearing the brunt of climate change.

The album's closing track, 'Banyak Rintangan,' is a politically charged track that perfectly summarizes Suarasama's message throughout the album - to stand up and fight for what is right regardless of obstacles in the way.

In conclusion, Fajar Di Atas Awan may be a rock album, but it's much more than that; it's a statement piece on the current state of society. I would highly recommend this album to anyone searching for music with a message. Suarasama has outdone themselves in terms of composition and relevance, and Fajar Di Atas Awan will certainly go down as one of their best works.","1.

Nick Lowe,At My Age,Rock,7.2,July 12 2007,Joshua Klein,,"No artist gets to decide how they'll be remembered. If, as seems increasingly likely, Nick Lowe ends up remembered as the guy who penned ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding"" back in the early 1970s, surely the songwriter will be satisfied. Yet fans and followers of Lowe know there's a nearly endless stream of legitimate second (or first) choices for pick of his defining moment. As a member of Brinsley Schwarz, Lowe helped bridge pub rock to punk. Lowe inaugurated the Stiff label with his single ""So It Goes"", and more explicitly helped pave the way for punk's indie movement by producing the Damned's epochal ""New Rose"". He subsequently produced key tracks for the Pretenders and several albums for Elvis Costello. But maybe most impressive of all Lowe's feats was ""The Beast in Me"", a song from his 1994 comeback album The Impossible Bird, long after he had faded from pop prominence. Later that same year, the song also became the best non-stunt cover of one-time father-in-law Johnny Cash's late-career comeback. It was a cred-boosting number all around, and proved once and for all Lowe's worth as a songwriter in the classic sense rather than just a snide wit with an ear for hooks. His nickname ""Basher"" stemmed from his ability/compulsion to just crank out songs, but The Impossible Bird and songs like ""The Beast in Me"" showed a more considered, thoughtful, patient side to Lowe. Fittingly and full circle, in many ways Lowe owes this mellow change of direction to ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding"". Curtis Stigers covered the song on the soundtrack to ""The Bodyguard"", and in Lowe's own words it was like someone suddenly dumped a bag of money on his doorstep. Free from commercial considerations, Lowe started exploring his love of classic country, soul, r&b and crooner jazz, a path that continues with the new At My Age. There's been some talk of this most recent stage of Lowe's career as being too sentimental, or sans balls. But while Lowe's hardly up to his old tricks, his new tricks have more than their share of pleasures. If Lowe used to attack pop songs with a punk's cynicism and an ironic streak a mile wide, these days he exudes the illusion that he's settled down and settled in when in fact he's been happily exploring formalism with a sly wink. By his account, he started taking his guitar out to the country and playing old dancehalls, letting the new material breath and live a little until it resembled the pre- and early-rock era he aimed to emulate. In fact, both Lowe and his press materials have made a big deal about distinguishing the covers from the originals contained on At My Age, and Lowe's last few records have made a similar game of spotting the genuine classic amidst the songs that simply sound like genuine classics. It's a cleverly subversive strategy in its own right, the grey-haired and grown-up ex-punk making music his dad would have liked, though experience has added an air of increased authenticity to songs such as ""A Better Man"" and the almost imperceptibly skanking ""Long Limbed Girl"". Indeed, now Lowe is 58, both his parents have passed, and he's an unlikely first time dad, so it's somewhat hard to imagine him twisting the earnest sentiments of Charlie Feathers' ""A Man in Love"" to suit his former sarcastic mode. Of course, Lowe can still be funny, too, as he is on ""The Club"", which begins ""If you've ever had someone come along/ Reach in, pull out your heart and break it/ Just for fun/ As easy as humming a song/ Join the club."" On ""People Change"" (which features Chrissie Hynde and some nice Stax horns), he basically dismisses the call of nostalgia with a blithe but affable declaration of ""People change/ That's the long and short of it."" ""Now, you say those times you had were never that many/ Just be thankful you had any/ And cut yourself a slice of reality,"" Lowe gently advises, and he seems to have taken his own advice and moved on. At his age, Lowe's still young enough to get away with making music in his former mode, but he's old enough to know better. Instead of looking to the recent past for inspiration, he's looked to the even more distant past, if only because it's the music that-- square or not-- currently makes him the most happy and content. And for 33 minutes or so, if you follow Lowe's lead and let loose any baggage you might be carrying, you're likely to be as happy as he is, too.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10399-at-my-age/,Yep Roc,2007.0,"Nick Lowe's latest album ""At My Age"" is a powerful and evocative collection of rock anthems that will leave listeners feeling electrified and inspired. With a remarkable rating of 7.2 out of 10, this album has been a fan favorite and has effectively cemented Lowe's legacy within the world of rock music. 

Lowe, a talented musician hailing from the UK, has had an extensive career in the music industry. He began his career as a bass player for the band Brinsley Schwarz in the early 1970s before moving on to pursue a solo career. His sound has evolved throughout his career, but his commitment to energetic and memorable rock music has always remained constant. Lowe has constantly amazed audiences with his raw and emotive vocals, his deft guitar work, and his innate passion for storytelling.

In terms of the album's production, ""At My Age"" is a triumph. The instrumentation is tight and expertly arranged, with each member of the band contributing their own unique sound to the mix. Lowe's voice is commanding and stirring, effortlessly leading the band through each song. The lyrics are also a standout aspect of the album. The songs feel deeply reflective, and the powerful and thought-provoking lyrics offer both an emotional depth and a level of social commentary that many rock albums lack. 

As a long-time fan of Nick Lowe, I was eager to experience ""At My Age"", and I was not disappointed. The album offers everything that is wonderful and unique about Lowe's music. The songs are sonically stunning, with each track standing on its own as a deeply personal and meaningful work of art. From the opening track ""A Better Man"" to the closing number ""I Ain't Got the Love"", the album is a journey through the many layers of Lowe's complex personality. 

Some standout tracks from the album include ""What's Shakin' on the Hill"", a highly-charged song that is both energetic and hopeful, and ""The Club"", which is a reflection on the power of music to bring us together in times of hardship. The lyrics on this album are beautifully-crafted and highly-relatable, offering listeners insights into the human experience that are both poignant and thought-provoking. 

Overall, ""At My Age"" is a triumphant reminder that Lowe still has a lot of the fire in his belly that made him a rock icon to begin with. With this album, he proves that he is still capable of producing highly engaging and deeply personal music that is both thought-provoking and entertaining. If you are a fan of rock music, then you owe it to yourself to give ""At My Age"" a listen - and I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.","1.

Catfish Haven,Please Come Back EP,Rock,7.6,March 1 2006,Brian Howe,Contributor,"Two gigantic red flags flap at the gates of Catfish Haven's Please Come Back EP. The first is the band's name. I'm wary whenever I see such a pointedly bucolic name attached to an indie label, as young sophisticates appropriating earnest backwater idioms tend to be boring at best and terrible at worst. My suspicion that Catfish Haven was a condescending indie-country band or ironic roots rock revival seemed to be borne out by red flag number two, frontman George Hunter's hoarse album-opening declaration: ""We're Catfish Haven and this is what we do!"" What, recycle old tropes of workmanlike humility without the hard-earned lived experience to justify them? Turns out I was wrong on both counts, and by the end of the title track, those red warning flags had both been bleached surrender-white. Catfish Haven scan as a bar band-- what with Hunter's smoky-throated moans and the lucid, feel-good quality of the music-- but there is no irony here. Nothing in the hooky melodies is purposefully obscured, and there's no sense of winking amusement at playing rootsy bar rock in a post-rock musical climate. It's the EP's open quality-- the songs are simple and everything happens right before your eyes-- that retroactively recasts Hunter's introductory invocation of sincere bar bands past as a self-effacing extension of his unflashy yet satisfying music. On the title track's searing rave-up, staccato emotive bursts get swept up in a tide of concisely pounding percussion and stately rhythm guitar. Projecting from the diaphragm without overselling the memorable melody, Hunter's voice can crank up like a lawnmower or suddenly dip into bluesy melancholy with equal facility, and on this track in particular he belts like Van Morrison at his amped-up best. But this isn't his only register. On the smoldering dirge ""Crying Shame"", Hunter trades his exuberance for a sinister theatricality Ã¡ la Nick Cave, dragging the last word of each line over infernal embers. Both styles find purchase on ""Madelin"", as whining string bends and a diabolically distressed ""whoa"" suddenly let out into winsome, clattering rock. Take away quirky instrumentation, genre experiments, and yelping vocals; what's left in the modern guitar band's arsenal? Catfish Haven remind us: Tuneful, passionate singing, lucid songwriting, and engaging riffs.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1828-please-come-back-ep/,Secretly Canadian,2006.0,"If you're a fan of indie rock, then you must have heard of Catfish Haven, a band that has been making music since the early 2000s. Please Come Back EP, their latest release, lives up to their reputation as one of the best indie rock bands around.

The EP consists of six tracks that showcase the band's signature sound - a fusion of rock and blues, laced with soulful melodies. From the opening track, ""Set in Stone"" to the closing song, ""Please Come Back,"" the EP offers a consistent, cohesive vibe.

What's most impressive about Please Come Back EP is how it balances the raw energy of rock with the more romantic, introspective side of the genre. Catfish Haven's lead vocalist, George Hunter, offers emotive vocals and poetic lyrics that add a personal touch to each song.

In terms of production, Please Come Back EP is a testament to the band's growth over the years. The sound is tight and polished, but not overproduced, which allows for the natural nuances of each instrument to shine through. The addition of a horn section on some of the tracks adds a nice touch of sophistication without detracting from the band's rock edge.

The EP's standout track is ""Tripping in Memphis,"" a groovy dance number that captures the spirit of the band's hometown. The song's catchy chorus and infectious rhythm make it the perfect track for a late-night party or a long drive.

Overall, Please Come Back EP by Catfish Haven earns a 7.6 out of 10. It's an impressive follow-up to their previous albums and demonstrates the band's ability to put out consistently excellent music. If you're a fan of indie rock, blues, or just great music in general, you'll want to add this EP to your collection.","1.

Tanya Tagaq,Retribution,Rock,8.2,October 25 2016,Stuart Berman,Contributor,"Before Tanya Tagaq is about to perform, she takes a few moments to speak to her audience. There’s the usual business of thanking everyone for coming out and introducing her band, though she also likes to talk about what’s on her mind—sometimes for a good 10 minutes before we hear a note of music. In the context of what follows, the preamble feels less like an introduction than a farewell, like the sort of address you hear from astronauts before they’re launched into space, or an escape artist who’s about to pull off an elaborate, death-defying stunt. That’s because Tagaq goes to places in her music that few others dare to tread. And when she’s in the throes of her violent, carnal, gesticulating concerts—which feel more like séances than performances—you’re not sure if that sweet, cheerful woman who was just bantering with the crowd will make it back alive. Tagaq hails from the Arctic territory of Nunavut in northern Canada, raised in a remote island town called Cambridge Bay that’s inaccessible by road. Her Inuk mother introduced her to their culture’s tradition of throat-singing, which is less a musical artform than a community pastime where two women square off face-to-face in friendly competition, producing heaving, gnarled, guttural sounds in responsive rhythmic patterns. But through Tagaq, this interactive activity has become a vehicle for primal, personal, political expression. Onstage, Tagaq doesn’t so much sing as plug herself into the Earth, transforming herself into a mood-ring manifestation of a ravaged planet squealing in pain with each oil-drill jab and earth-scorching heat wave. Atop her band’s swelling, screeching soundscapes, Tagaq’s sleeping-giant purrs mutate into death metal-worthy growls—and when she snaps out of her trance an hour later, it feels like you’ve just borne witness to Godspeed You Black Exorcist. Tagaq belongs to a lineage of iconoclastic vocalists that includes Yoko Ono and Diamanda Galás—artists notorious for pushing both musical and physical limits in their work. And her extreme approach has engendered collaborations with the likes of Björk, Kronos Quartet, Mike Patton, and Fucked Up. But Tagaq’s new album arrives at a moment when she’s on the verge of becoming Canada’s unlikeliest crossover act. Her previous record, Animism, won the Polaris Music Prize in 2014, leading to several high-profile festival appearances and TED Talks; she can even currently be heard on mainstream Canadian radio singing back-up on the latest single from Toronto alt-rockers July Talk. But most crucially, the restless, raging Retribution emerges at a time when Canada is reckoning with its historic, government-sanctioned mistreatment of the country’s indigenous population—a long-simmering, long-suppressed topic that’s now become an explosive flashpoint in the national conversation, much as systemic, anti-black racism has in the U.S. In Canada, the operative word right now is “reconciliation,” the process by which the government hopes to make amends with the indigenous community for the awful legacy of Canada’s residential-school system. From the mid-19th century till 1996, the system separated indigenous children from their families and forced them into church-led classrooms as a means to assimilate them into white, Christian, Canadian society. And the coercion, sadly, went beyond the curriculum—students were subjected to horrific, unchecked abuse at the hands of their supposed educators, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 6,000 children over the years. For Tagaq—an alumnus of the system—reconciliation has been a slow, ineffective, bureaucratic process. As the title of her new record makes clear, she wants retribution. And not just for Canada’s under-the-rug history of cultural genocide, but for the current plights of her people: the epidemic number of indigenous women who are abducted, raped, and murdered in Canada each year, and the environmental havoc wreaked by the country’s tar sand-sucking oil industry. As a singer who deals mostly in wordless expression, Tagaq’s most pointed political statements have been broadcast through extramusical means: her fearlessly profane interviews, her hyperactive Twitter feed, and her jaw-dropping Polaris-gala performance, where she used her national stage to project the names of 1,200 missing or murdered indigenous women. And to top it off, she used her acceptance speech to flip off PETA for its opposition to seal hunting, on which Tagaq’s isolated community depends for sustenance. But on Retribution, the messaging is baked right into the music. Much like those aforementioned pre-show speeches, Retribution provides instant exposition in the form of its title track, where, over a panting vocal pulse, Tagaq offers a spoken-word treatise: “Our mother grows angry/Retribution will be swift/We squander her soil and suck out her sweet, black blood to burn it.” But Tagaq isn’t preaching to the choir. She’s stirring the beast, alternating her voice between a panicked yelp and an esophagus-shredding grunt, while piercing violins horsewhip the band into a furious gallop. Like Animism, Tagaq recorded Retribution with the core duo of violinist Jesse Zubot and percussionist Jean Martin, whose free-form sound-scraping blurs the lines between folk, classical, klezmer, post-rock, musique concrete, and slasher-flick soundtrack. The new album trades in queasy atmospherics for a more robust rhythmic attack, with Tagaq feeding off the band’s energy as much as vice versa. “Aorta” explodes with a disorienting swirl of seagull squeals, foghorn-like drones, and vocals that sound like they’re being sung backwards. But the song’s brawny groove indulges the fantasy of hearing Tagaq unleash her gnashed-teeth roar in a hard-rock context. And there’s even a straight-up, boom-bap throwback in “Centre,” on which guest MC Shad’s circular rhymes ruminate on humanity’s infinitesimal place in the universe at large, while Tagaq’s melodic counter-vocal celebrates our own microscopic, menstrual origins by coining her own genre: “wombcore.” By more readily embracing rock and rap forms, Retribution stands to lure a wider audience into Tagaq’s unsettled sound world—but only to ensnare it like prey as she goes in for the kill. “Cold” is the most harrowing science-class lecture you’ll ever hear: Tagaq recites the effects of global warming on the Arctic, before ominously declaring, “Human civilization as we know it will no longer exist… because Gaia likes it cold.” The song’s stalking groove then goads her into a symphony of screams that renders melting ice as burning flesh. And where Retribution’s more muscular moments are countered by amorphous, aggro-ambient pieces like “Nacreous” and “Sulfur,” the centerpiece track “Summoning” bridges the extremes. Over the course of nine tumultuous minutes, the song unfolds like a found-sound radio opera, with Toronto’s 50-strong Element Choir gradually taunting and prodding a terrified Tagaq as if she were being offered up for ceremonial sacrifice. Retribution is very much a mirror image of Aninism: Where the latter record opened with a reverential, orchestro-folk cover of the Pixies’ “Caribou” and closed with the disturbing, nightmarish moans of “Fracking,” Retribution’s turbulent journey settles onto familiar turf with a cover of another alt-rock classic. Tagaq’s “Caribou” was a cheeky, celebratory act of cultural reclamation from someone raised hunting the namesake animal (not to mention someone who can out-scream Black Francis). Here, her eerily calm cover of Nirvana’s “Rape Me” transforms Kurt Cobain’s narrative role-play into unflinching autobiography, with its disturbing allusions to the multiple sexual assaults Tagaq was subjected to as a child. But when Tagaq sings, “I’m not the only one,” she’s speaking for more than just fellow survivors. “Rape Me” marks the moment where the intersectional relationship among Retribution’s primary concerns—feminism, environmentalism, indigenous rights—is laid bare, with a hushed Tagaq staking out the liminal space between feeling defeated and feeling defiant. And by the end, the song’s incessant drum beat sounds more like a death rattle—a tick-tock reminder that retribution is not some distant prophecy, but a looming inevitability.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22324-retribution/,,2016.0,"If you’re searching for an album that transcends genre boundaries and shakes your musical foundation to the core, then look no further than Tanya Tagaq’s “Retribution”. With a unique blend of rock, Inuit throat singing, and avant-garde experimentation, this album is a sonic journey that will leave you breathless.

To begin with, it's important to note that Tagaq is a Canadian Inuk singer, who has been honored with the prestigious Polaris Music Prize previously. Having already established herself as an innovative force in the music world, it's no surprise that she has continued to push the boundaries of genre with her latest work. According to Tagaq, ""Retribution"" was born out of her desire to explore themes of survival, injustice, and retribution in her music.

The result is a haunting and powerful album that showcases Tagaq’s breathtaking vocal range and her ability to push the limits of human expression. From the opening track “Ajaaja” which features a hypnotic groove that builds to an intense climax, to standout tracks like “Retribution” and “Centre,” every song on this album is a masterclass in musical experimentation.

What stands out about this album is not just the quality of the songs, but also the production. Each track is meticulously crafted with layers of sound that perfectly complement Tagaq’s vocal performance. The use of traditional Inuit instruments, such as the drum and throat singing, are expertly blended with electronic beats and guitar riffs, creating a truly unique sonic landscape.

As a fan of both rock and experimental music, I found “Retribution” to be one of the most satisfying albums of the year. Tagaq’s voice is a force of nature, and the way she seamlessly weaves in and out of different genres is a true testament to her artistry. The arrangements are complex, yet accessible, making this album equally enjoyable for both the musically savvy and casual listener alike.

Overall, ""Retribution"" is an album that takes risks and challenges what we expect from music. It's an album that invites us to explore new territories both musically and emotionally, and Tagaq is the perfect guide for this journey. With a rating of 8.2 out of 10, ""Retribution"" is a must-listen for anyone who cherishes the power of music to transport us beyond genre and into the realm of the extraordinary.","1.

Antietam,Opus Mixtum,Rock,6.4,April 29 2008,Joshua Klein,,"One could be forgiven for thinking that Antietam didn't exist anymore. Even at the relative height of its popularity, the Louisville-turned-Hoboken band turned heads with legendary live performances but didn't exactly raise the head count of its fans (poppy guitar freakout peers such as Yo La Tengo and Eleventh Dream Day included among them). As far as many of those fans were concerned, Antietam ended after 1994's slept-on Rope-A-Dope, and if the band in its heyday flew under the radar, that's nothing compared to the low profile of its 2004 comeback Victory Park. Now Antietam have risen once again, and anyone clamoring for some classic indie-rock will be heartened by the arrival of Opus Mixtum, two-discs of new Antietam music recorded by the surprisingly stable trio of singer/guitar hero Tara Key, bassist Tim Harris, and drummer Josh Madell, the band's core since 1991. Yes, two discs, drawn from two separate sessions originally envisioned for two separate albums, one highlighting the band's softer side and the other its status as one of the great forgotten guitar shredders of the indie era. Yet if there's a downside to Antietam's longevity, it's that at this stage in the game the band really doesn't have much to add to the conversation. Even at two discs, Opus Mixtum hardly overstays its welcome, but the degree of welcome it meets is likely linked to your preference for the familiar Neil Young-does-VU school of indie that ruled the underground in the 1980s. It's hardly a straight nostalgia trip, but at the same time Key, Harris, and Madell in 2008 aren't exactly pushing things forward. That's not what Antietam are about, though. The band's not out to change the rules but raise the roof, and at its best Opus Mixtum accents the relative timelessness of Antietam's music. Songs like ""Shipshape"", ""Turn It on Me"", ""Pennants and Flags"", and ""That's the Way It Is"" would have earned a prime place on college radio in any era. One could even imagine a simple song like the instrumental ""Arrowhead Syrup"" or the rollicking ""Needle and the Eye"", sharpened with better production and beefed up with beaucoup marketing bucks, as leftfield alt-rock hits. Admittedly, that's ""alt"" as in ""alternate-reality,"" as Antietam, accessible though they may be, recognize there's a place for their music and that place will always be under the radar. Modest expectations give the group great confidence when it comes to crafting its brand of indie meat and potatoes rock, as does the knowledge that jaws will drop when Antietam tear it up on-stage. Still, that confidence can only carry Antietam so far. Even the (superior) Eleventh Dream Day quickly hit a glass ceiling before settling for an Antietam-styled part-time existence. Yet if the band is first and foremost about fretwork, feedback, and churning riffs, Antietam's mellower moments don't sound totally out of place. The cinematic strum of the instrumental ""Steel G"" seems all about the open road at sunset, while ""Red Balloon Waltz"" and ""The Gate Closed"" (both also instrumental) are no less evocative. ""Hasten"" substitutes the usual Antietam all-out dynamics with whispered vocals and trumpet. ""On the Humble"" bridges the Byrds with the VU, and ""Tierra del Fuego"" ends the album on a drifting, droning note, drawing out to nearly ten minutes of gentle folk and dubby effects. It makes you wonder whether Opus Mixtum might have been better separated into vocal and instrumental discs, the better to show off these two complementary sides of the band.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11391-opus-mixtum/,Carrot Top,2008.0,"Antietam's ""Opus Mixtum"" is a rock album that confronts the listener with its raw, simplistic sound. Rating at 6.4 out of 10, it's clear that some music enthusiasts might dismiss this album as mediocre. However, I think it's essential to give this album a chance, as it offers a refreshing perspective on the rock genre.

Antietam is a band that dates back to the '80s in New York. This group has gone through several changes over the years, with the current lineup consisting of bassist Tim Harris, drummer Josh Madell, and frontwoman/guitarist Tara Key, who founded the group. Antietam has always played with typical rock instruments; however, there is an energy in the recordings that make the music sound more punk than classic rock.

""Opus Mixtum"" is their ninth album, and it combines a mixture of tracks recorded over the past decade, hence the title ""Opus Mixtum."" One may argue that the album might be lacking cohesion; however, I found it a unique blend of Antietam's best sounds from different times. When recorded across years, it's interesting to hear how Antietam has evolved in terms of style.

As you listen to the album, one may notice how Key's vocals have a mix of disinterest and urgency, adding to the urgency of the guitar riffs. In ""Sunshine,"" the opening track, the frequent shifts in tempo are surprising, and you're not quite sure where the track is going, but the sonic textures keep the listener wanting more. ""Caramel"" is the most commercially viable track, and at first listen, it sounds like a classic rocker, but once you give it another chance, you notice the vitality emanating from the guitar riffs; the anticipation from the pounding drumkit only to simmer down into a whimsical guitar melody is enchanting. 

I can't deny that this album is not for everyone. However, for those who embrace new perspectives, it's an album that shouldn't be overlooked. As a rock enthusiast, it's tricky to find albums that explore the genre outside of the typical formulas. Antietam's ""Opus Mixtum"" is sublime in its own right, and the sounds and visions embody grit, rawness, and just an appreciation for the simplicity that genre brings.","1.

Yamataka Eye and John Zorn,Naninani II,,7.7,February 21 2005,Cameron Macdonald,,"Here's a scene to burn into your mind: Yamataka Eye looks up to God with a thick, green vocoder tube dangling from his throat as if he's a 10-second-old newborn. He holds a mic to his lips to emit a noise that is a cross between a mosquito dazedly banging into a porch light and a junior high video class sound effect of a crashing UFO. It's potentially tragicomic, but there is nothing else to do or think about-- just to watch. One's ears can seem like they're bleeding with tinnitus until the camera shifts to the right. John Zorn blows half of his saxophone into a pitcher of water as if on life support, his shoulders high and face shrunken. Zorn is convulsing with each squeal while his comrade adjusts his noise-box for another fix. Eye's electricity now hums into a wail-- leading to a climax where Zorn re-attaches his brass to end the argument with the tone of a drill sergeant's face hit by a recruit's spat. Eye rips the tube out of his mouth and undergoes an epileptic kabuki fit. He almost screeches in key and rhythm to Zorn's blats; ending right on the beat. Their audience at NYC's Tonic applauds as if being on Maury Povich. That QuickTime video clip of ""M.S.T.G.L. (moneysextripgodlove)""-- filmed during one of Zorn's 30-odd birthday party concerts he threw for his 50-year-old self at Tonic in September 2003-- could be another case of testosterone poisoning art. It could also be noise as the phantasmagoric possession of the human soul. Both Zorn and Eye embody the latter-- exposing the tension and sheer camp of the human body's barely domesticated noises. Eye's work with the enigmatic Boredoms often sounded like a rehearsal space with three bands screaming and out-drumming each other just to hear themselves. And then there is Zorn, who could fill libraries with translations of Attention Deficit Disordered-jazz into episodes of Ornette Coleman's America, grindcore metal dirges, and the genre-damming Cobra game-- the rules of which I still can't fathom after the 20th read-through. Both gentlemen can make listeners laugh, flinch, squint, cup their mouths, or walk outside for fresh air. The past few months saw two releases where Eye 'n' Zorn broke bread: 50th Birthday Celebration documents their Sept. 15 gig, while Naninani II is a sequel to their '95 zoo animal revolt. Listening to their new work was masochistic for me. High-pitched tones disturb me, and Zorn cleared my sinuses with one of the more horrific squeals caught live on tape in the 50th Birthday closer, ""Choronzone"". He out-guns Eye after his techie Sawai Taeji deliver a slippery cathedral organ drone that falls into a hole. In the opener, ""Postivia,"" Zorn berates a broken TV, courtesy of Eye's garbled static. The freak show element both entices and repels. In ""Microwavable Empty Highway"", Eye mimics a howler monkey's mating call to Zorn's balladry that places an arm around a stranger in a subway train and tells of modeling (prostitution) opportunities in Hong Kong. ""Sun See Soon"" is an old-fashioned dick around with avant-guitar legend Fred Frith squeaking along with Eye's microphone feedback and Zorn's vile birdsong. Naninani II is stronger with finer studio attention to detail and ambient atmospherics. Echoes of the Boredoms are heard, as ""Espimo""'s rhythms of a pink-elephant chasing-woodblock and the saxophone riffs that tell it to shut up because it's trying to sleep, loosely recall the Osaka band's oldie, ""Your Name is Limitless."" More arresting is ""Fat Anarchy on Airtube"", where Eye's whooshed breaths and rollicking koto noodlings lead to a hymnal drone that seems to make it difficult for someone to breathe, causing him or her to steadily pound the walls. ""Shiso Baba"" revamps the same electronic drone but oddly finds a sort of pantheistic awe in the temple bell tones and Eye's infantile utterances. Elsewhere, ""Kiri Taki"" resembles a mystic chanting a raga and pounding tablas to the tune of a nearby Pole Position arcade machine. The more baffling ""4ab"" lets Zorn serenade to what is either a duck tearing up a newspaper in pond, or a frustrated photographer fumbling one print after another in a darkroom. I don't want to know the sight or smell of whomever produced those noises.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11870-naninani-ii-50th-birthday-celebration/,"Tzadik,Tzadik",2004.0,"Hey there, music lovers!

Today, let's talk about the latest album from two of the most legendary and creative artists in the music scene: Yamataka Eye and John Zorn, and their latest work, ""Naninani II"". After collaborating on multiple occasions in the past, the duo decided to come together once again to create a second version of their Naninani series, which has been rated a 7.7 out of 10.

Yamataka Eye, also known as Maso Yamazaki, is popularly known as the frontman of the Japanese noise rock band, Boredoms. His unique vocal style and experimental tendencies have earned him a cult following over the years. John Zorn, on the other hand, is an American musician, saxophonist, and composer who is renowned for his avant-garde and experimental work across various genres.

The duo's collaboration on ""Naninani II"" is no exception. The album builds upon the foundations that were laid in their previous work and takes the listener on an immersive and experimental journey. The album is deeply rooted in the genre of nan music, one that originated in Japan, where sounds from nature are recorded and used as the musical basis for a piece. The technique of converting sounds of nature into music is what makes nan special, and the duo manages to showcase the nuances of this genre in the most creative and artistic way possible.

The album is a combination of ambient sounds, erratic instrumental passages, and the occasional free-form vocals from Yamataka. The opening track, ""Fujisan,"" is a prime example of this mixture, utilizing the sounds of a thunderstorm as the foundation for an evolving and mystical soundscape. It is a mesmerizing track that brilliantly encapsulates the essence of the genre.

One of the standout elements of the album is the production. The use of live instrumentation, coupled with electronic effects and experimental techniques, makes for a diverse and multi-layered sound. From the haunting sounds of the flute in ""Taketombo"" to the frenzied saxophone in ""Kanazawa"", the pairing of acoustic and electronic elements creates something completely unique.

Personal favorites from the album include ""Kanazawa"" and ""Hidokeki"". ""Kanazawa"" is a breakneck track, with an almost-maniacal sax solo from Zorn that is both hypnotic and overwhelming. ""Hidokeki,"" on the other hand, is an introspective piece that showcases Yamataka's ability to create emotive soundscapes that are both haunting and beautiful.

Overall, ""Naninani II"" is a strange and yet fulfilling journey through the wilds of experimental music. The album embodies the essence of the nan genre and showcases the artistic prowess of Yamataka Eye and John Zorn. It is not for the casual listener, but for those who are interested in exploring the unknown and delving into unchartered musical territories, this album is a must-listen. Trust me on this one.","Review A uses more complex language and includes more detailed descriptions of the music and artists. It also includes personal opinion and commentary on the music.

Juana Molina,Halo,Folk/Country,8.0,May 9 2017,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,Contributor,"The first songs Juana Molina wrote on her guitar as a young girl in Argentina were simple things, repetitive melodies comprised of a few notes and chords. She would play them over and over for weeks on end, lulling herself into a trance. Without the confidence to explore her droning ambient tendencies, she dressed them up with a chorus, verse, and bridge, a spoonful of sugar meant to disguise her kookier tendencies. Her 1996 debut LP Rara did much of the same, a folky pop record that only offered glimpses of the rhythmic experimentation she would later explore more fully. Her early career was marked by a slow shedding of her protective pop armor. And when she discovered the Boss RC-20 loop station for 2004’s Tres Cosas, she finally had the tool to take those trance-inducing loops she’d been drawn to since childhood and craft lush, layered compositions. With each record, as she’s shed layer after layer of constricting pop and folk structures, she seems to reveal more and more of herself. Halo is Molina’s seventh and strongest LP. She wields a sonic palette refined by two decades of experimentation to create a narrative defined not by words, but by mood. Loosely based on the folk legend of the “luz mala”—a halo of “evil light” that floats above the ground where bones are buried—the record evokes the occult in its music as much as in its Spanish lyrics. The fickle protagonist of “Paraguaya” feeds potions to a lover in order to manipulate his desires, but beyond the words, there’s clearly some brujería at work. The ominous strings and purring percussion make that clear, if the 1,000-yard stare peering at you from the femur on the album’s cover didn’t already. On 2008’s “Un Día,” Molina sung of a desire to deliver songs with no lyrics; in 2017, she’s perfected the form. Three tracks on Halo—“In the Lassa,” “A00 B01,” and “Andó”—feature her voice but no words. Her rhythmic vocals are looped and layered, blending in as another instrumental layer in the ambient compositions. Above each song hangs a looming specter, its characters in search of paranormal assistance in the physical realm to soothe their confusion and regret. Occasionally she even seems to speak with her synthesizer; its brooding warble on “Cálculos y Oráculos” is as expressive as any vocal. Much is made of Molina’s past as a comedic television performer in Argentina. Her decision to walk away from her show “Juana y Sus Hermanas” at the peak of its popularity is an alluring part of her mystique, but it also underscores her intention. Her acting career was a means to an end, a way to support her music, the art she cared about. Her early folk tendencies and pop structures served a similar purpose, a means to explore the off-kilter rhythms and ambient melodies that lulled her into a trance as a child, pulling us in along with her. Halo suggests a self-realization that is often breathtaking. On “Cara de espejo,” Molina sings of a woman looking in the mirror, shocked by the truth she finds in her own reflection. “Cuando uno sabe qué va a verse en un espejo/Pone la cara que espera ver en el reflejo,” she sings. Or, in English, “When you know you'll look at yourself in the mirror/You pull the face you hope to see in the reflection.” It seems Molina finally sees her true self staring back at her.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23124-halo/,Crammed Discs,2017.0,"If you're a fan of music that's both folksy and country, you'll absolutely love Juana Molina's album ""Halo."" It's got an ambiance that's both quiet and rebellious, infused with so much character and emotion that it feels like Juana was singing to you directly.

One of the really interesting things about Juana Molina is how varied and exciting her musical career has been. She's a singer, songwriter, actress, and comedian - you might recognize her from her work on Argentinian TV shows. But her musical career really took off with her 2000 debut album ""Rara."" With each new album, Juana has experimented with her sound, and with ""Halo,"" she's hit her stride - this album is a triumph.

The creation story of ""Halo"" is almost as impressive as the music itself. Apparently, Juana used a combination of found sounds, loops, and improvised melodies to put the album together. It's an incredible testament to her skill as a musician, and it really shines through in the final product. Each and every song has an incredible depth and complexity that's almost impossible to describe.

One of my personal favorite songs on the album is ""Cosoco."" It's one of the more upbeat numbers on the album, and it really showcases Juana's talent as a writer - the lyrics are playful and silly, but there's a real depth there as well. And the instrumentation is just perfect - everything from the guitar riffs to the drum beats is just spot-on.

Overall, I think ""Halo"" is definitely an album to add to your collection if you're a fan of folk or country music. It's got so much to offer in terms of both style and substance, and it's one of those rare albums that just keeps getting better with each listen. Juana Molina has really outdone herself with this one - it's a true masterpiece.","Step 1: Review A is a longer, more detailed review with specific references to the artist's background, the evolution of her sound, and the inspiration behind the album.

Death Index,Death Index,Rock,7.0,February 22 2016,Sam Lefebvre,Contributor,"Merchandise’s evolution from wounded bedroom pop to vivid college rock was paralleled by vocalist Carson Cox’s public contemplation of punk, a slide from weary respect for its values to exhaustion with its dogma. In 2012, Cox told Pitchfork, ""Punk is still the spiritual music of my life, but I’m not interested in being that kind of person anymore."" In 2014, ahead of Merchandise’s 4AD-released After the End, he demurred to NME, ""I was born after punk died, so whatever."" To Noisey: ""I’m just sick of fucking punk scenes."" Fittingly then, Cox and collaborator Marco Rapisarda’s collaboration as Death Index didn’t involve rehearsal, gigging, or any other trappings of scene participation. It’s the next passage in Cox’s personal history of estrangement from punk. Death Index was recorded in Berlin, Tampa, and Italy. Cox sings on every track. Rapisarda, a regular in Italy’s hardcore scene, plays everything else. A few songs surfaced online late last year, grabbing attention from high-profile U.S. hardcore label Deathwish. Their live lineup is forthcoming at the moment of Death Index’s release, meaning the record was made by in-studio, part-by-part layering. It's a novel way to create punk or hardcore—which typically celebrate live ensemble combustibility and recordings that capture it—and the oblique approach helps explain Death Index’s alien charms and rudderless missteps alike. The recording process’s fragmentation seems to have yielded an album where Cox sounds as distant from the music as he apparently feels from punk itself. Sometimes that distance makes for fascinating contrasts, setting Rapisarda's deft, muscular performances against Cox's emotionally textured vocals. Musically, opener ""Fast Money Kill"" is rousing, concise hardcore that Antidote fans will recognize as nearly identical to ""Life as One."" But Cox’s full-bodied singing, with its aching quiver and trill,  evokes the dreary post-punk of Manchester. His nuanced, wounded croon also distinguish the throttling ""Fuori Controllo"" and the leering ""Little N Pretty,"" the music's insular, sealed-off atmosphere allowing for the unlikely combination to flourish. Sometimes, though, the sound skews antiseptic and clinical on songs that crave deformities. The dirge-like ""FUP,"" on which Cox professes his numbness in rather hackneyed terms, (""I’m so fucked up/ That I fall down to my knees/ Where you can’t feel anything"") and the spare synth pulsations of ""Lost Bodies"" feel like orphaned intros, over before they start. ""The Meal"" and ""We’ve Got a Number"" feature martial rhythms and rollicking riffs in the style of post-punk acts such as the Birthday Party but it's missing the dynamics, the urgency, the frantic, headlong motion, and the threat of splintering apart. Here it feels more like a grid plotted with leaden thwacks and blackened leads. In these moments, Death Index sounds too steady; undergirded by the metronomic logic of the studio, it precludes the mutations, even mistakes, that live collaboration instilled in its influences.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21545-death-index/,Deathwish,2016.0,"When it comes to finding new and exciting music, I always keep an ear out for the latest releases, and Death Index's self-titled album is no exception. With a unique blend of influences that span decades of rock music, this album truly stands out as an original work that any rock fan should appreciate.

Formed by two legendary figures in the underground punk and metal scenes, Carson Cox and Marco Rapisarda, Death Index grew out of a shared passion for raw, hard-hitting rock music. After years of playing in various other projects, Cox and Rapisarda found a natural synergy together, and Death Index was born.

What makes this album truly special is the way it manages to combine the grit and intensity of punk with the melodic sensibilities of classic rock. From the scorching guitar riffs of ""Fast Money Kills"" to the haunting melody of ""Dream Machine,"" there's a real sense of depth and complexity to these songs that make them stand out from the rest.

One of my personal favorite tracks on the album is ""The Meal,"" which features a driving beat and dark, brooding melody that really captures the band's unique sound. I also appreciate the way the lyrics explore themes of alienation and despair, adding another layer of emotional depth to the music.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Death Index's self-titled album to anyone who loves hard-hitting rock music with a unique and innovative twist. With a rating of 7.0 out of 10, this album offers a fresh perspective on an established genre, and is sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who gives it a listen.

Supergrass,Road to Rouen,"Electronic,Rock",7.2,August 29 2005,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"Nothing makes you feel older than a band whose career you've followed almost from the start releasing a greatest hits album, but that's what Supergrass did last year. Bands that get old tend to get all ""mature,"" and the last thing a band like Supergrass needs is maturity-- their best songs thrive on youthful energy and a naive appropriation of influences you didn't know could be mixed together. So I was hoping for a mid-life crisis on Road to Rouen, the band's fifth album. The terrible pun in the title is a good start, but they're still mellowing, settling into their success and putting their swagger in a less visible place. They're good enough songwriters that they can survive slowing down a bit, but there's no question that this is Supergrass' least-exciting album yet. Granted Road to Rouen does have a fistful of killer moments during its brief under-40 runtime. You get the swamp-rocking title track and its companion ""Kick in the Teeth"", which together make up the album's late-energy burst. ""Road to Rouen"" is stuffed with nasty descending riffs and volume pedal swells to back up Gaz Coombes' blue-eyed soul croon. On an album that resides mostly in slower tempos, it becomes clear just what a great singer Coombes is: He has a rich, nuanced voice that sounds great shouting or navigating a delicate melodic phrase. ""St. Petersburg"" is something of an underwhelming lead single, a mid-tempo shuffle on which everything from the piano to the vocal is merely workmanly; the most interesting thing in the song is its stretchy string arrangement, which twists and pulls like taffy. It doesn't seem like something that would make the Supergrass Is 20 compilation in 2014. More likely candidates include album opener ""Tales of Endurance (parts 4, 5 & 6)"", a song that plays a lot like something from the band's self-titled third album, with a lengthy intro of acoustic strumming, piano. and echoing slide guitar. Trumpets and strings break in to announce the groove and the band slinks through a darkly funky verse, finally exploding after a second orchestral interlude into a big, stomping chorus with shades of ""What Went Wrong (In Your Head?)"". Unfortunately, Supergrass doesn't really ever harness any of the momentum they create on individual songs to make a truly great LP, throwing away the peak they reach on the epic, six-and-a-half-minute power ballad ""Roxy"" on a meaningless, jokey interlude called ""Coffee in the Pot"". There's a lot to love here, and Supergrass is still a killer band when they get in their groove, but there's definitely a noticeable lack of the hunger that once dripped from their music, no sneer to bring it all crashing home. Road to Rouen will get its spins in my house, but I'm crossing my fingers for the mid-life crisis next time out.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7627-road-to-rouen/,EMI,2005.0,"Supergrass' ""Road to Rouen"" is an album that encapsulates the best of both the rock and electronic genres. With a rating of 7.2 out of 10, I found this album to be an enjoyable and cohesive listening experience. Let me take you on a journey through the history of the band and the creation story of this album.

Supergrass has always been an influential band, and their contributions to the music industry have been nothing short of remarkable. The band was formed in Oxford, England in 1993, and consists of Gaz Coombes (vocals, guitar), Mick Quinn (bass guitar), and Danny Goffey (drums). The band's sound is a unique blend of Britpop, punk, and rock, with a touch of psychedelia.

""Road to Rouen"" was released in 2005 and marked a significant departure from their previous albums. The album was recorded in France, and the band made a conscious decision to move away from their signature sound and experiment with different instrumentation and production techniques. This approach paid off, and ""Road to Rouen"" is a masterpiece that showcases the band's versatility and growth.

From the opening track, ""Tales of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 & 6),"" the listener is immediately drawn in by the intricate layering of instruments and the electrifying energy. The use of electronic beats and synthesisers injects a fresh new sound into the mix, while the catchy vocal hooks and soaring guitar riffs keep the listener engaged. ""St. Petersburg"" is another standout track that finds the perfect balance between electronic and rock elements, with a driving beat and pulsating bassline.

While the album's production and experimentation are top-notch, the standout feature of ""Road to Rouen"" is the songwriting. Each track tells a unique story and showcases the band's ability to create vivid imagery with their lyrics. ""Low C"" is a hauntingly beautiful track with lyrics that seem to paint a picture of lost love and longing. Coombes’ vocal delivery is emotive and raw, and the sparse instrumentation only serves to accentuate the pain in his voice.

In conclusion, Supergrass' ""Road to Rouen"" is a must-listen for anyone who appreciates the fusion of electronic and rock genres. The band's willingness to push the boundaries of their sound is admirable, and the result is a cohesive and enjoyable listening experience. While some may argue that the album lacks the immediate catchiness of their earlier work, I believe that the depth and complexity of the songwriting more than makes up for it. Overall, ""Road to Rouen"" is an impressive achievement that showcases the band's growth and artistic versatility.","1.

Kitty Pryde,haha i'm sorry EP,Rap,6.0,June 27 2012,Lindsay Zoladz,Contributor,"Earlier this year, the The New York Times reported on a new study about the speech patterns of young women. Linguists from Long Island University published a paper that examined 18-to-25-year-old women's use of uptalk (which is when you talk? like this?), the word ""like"" as filler, and a phenomenon known as vocal fry, which they rather long-windedly defined as ""a form of phonation, characterized by a distinct laryngeal vibratory pattern,"" but, like, you know what they meannnnnn. The easy assumption is that anyone (especially over 18) who talks like this is stupid, artless, and possibly related to a Kardashian, but linguists now conclude just the opposite: ""A lot of these really flamboyant things you hear... girls are using them to achieve some kind of interactional and stylistic end."" Of course, you already knew that if you've turned on a radio in the past few years. Nicki Minaj is the poet laureate of vocal fry, and her verse on Britney Spears' ""Till the World Ends"" remix is a master class in mining this effect for laughs: ""Sniff, sniff, criiiiiiiiies/ I done staged your whole entire fucking liiiiiiife."" This aspect of Minaj's flow both embraces and exaggerates the way that young women allegedly talk to each other, and pushes it until it feels artificial, absurd, and even a little bit uncomfortable. When she says, ""It's Britney, biiiiiiiiitch,"" she holds the vowel so long you want to take a breath for her. In the most practical sense, the rapid internet fame (a video nearing 400,000 views, a mention in The New York Times, a style shoot with Danny Brown) of 19-year-old Florida rapper/Claire's Boutique associate Kitty Pryde owes something to the rapper that she's called ""the queen of [her] heart."" ""I was hanging out with my friends and we were listening to Nicki Minaj,"" Kitty says of the first time she tried rapping, ""And every time we would listen to [""Roger That""], we would just go over the song and do different lyrics."" But while her talent is much slighter and less adroitly theatrical than Minaj's, Kitty similarly embraces girl culture while slyly, smartly caricaturing it. Like all of her boldest lines, the chatter that opens her micro-hit ""okay cupid"" may seem either perfect or cloyingly inevitable: ""Get outta my rooooom."" That story from The New York Times (excuse me, the Fucking New York Times) is relevant to the questions that were asked when Kitty's self-recorded demos (""Justin Bieber"", The Lizzie McGuire Experience) first blipped the radar a few months ago. Because of her voice and presentation, people wondered: Is she a precocious 14-year-old or a market-tested, Carly Rae Jepsen-esque 26-year old? Is she totally awful or kind of great? Is she actually in on the joke? haha i'm sorry may not put these questions to bed, but to act like Kitty Pryde is guileless is to miss the wryness and self-awareness that's crucial to her music and persona. Her creaky-voiced flow is a perfect stylistic match for the banal, crush-struck things she raps about, as it dances on the smeared line between boredom and Ambien tripping; which is not to say that it's style-less, but that the substance is in the style. Still, unlike her idol Minaj's Beam Me Up Scotty (or her other idol Danny Brown's XXX), the five-track haha i'm sorry isn't the sort of scene-storming mixtape that hints at a wide-open future. But it's not artless enough to write off as a meme, either. Instead it's something between those two extremes: the sound of somebody working deliberately within the context of her humble limitations. As of-the-moment as Kitty Pryde feels, she's someone internet culture has been acquainted with since the early days of MySpace photography: the girl who knows her best angles. Each of them is on display on the Beautiful Lou-produced ""okay cupid"", her best and most fully realized song by a mall-parking-lot mile. Nevermind the Bud Lite Lime in her hand in the video or the references to Adderall; the sharp irony and crafty confidence of Kitty's lines comes from the fact that she's the sober one, the knowing observer. ""Call me sober when you're ready,"" she tells the serial drunk-dialer who's stolen her heart, but she's got one up on him because she's able to express the way he makes her feel: ""I'm not familiar with this type of devotion/ I used to be a pimp without emotion/ And now you've got me simpin and singing the Frank Ocean."" At its fleeting best, Kitty's music captures something human and disarmingly honest about longing in the hyper-connected disconnect of the digital world. Her back-and-forth with rapper Dankte on ""ay shawty: THE SHREKONING!!!"" starts out like a note passed to a crush during class, but it's later revealed to be something more complicated: an e-mail exchange with somebody smitten with her internet persona but who she's afraid to meet IRL, lest the spell be broken. ""Forget that you never met me,"" she mutters, ""I bet that when you do you will regret wanting to be next to me."" Still, haha i'm sorry shows a problematically narrow range despite the fact that it's only 12-and-a-half minutes long. Certain repeated details (the Adderall dependency, the chew-toy squeaks on ""orion's belt"", the giggly jokes about scabies) feel more like placeholders than idiosyncrasies meant to add texture to her persona. The self-proclaimed ""rap game pest"" is well-versed in the art of trolling, as she indicates on her fuck-the-haters anthem, ""smiledog.jpg"". But despite its surface charms, that track exposes her biggest problem: Kitty Pryde too often coasts on the assumption that it's the simple fact of her presence that's garnered all the attention and hand-wringing surrounding her, not the far more threatening fact that she might actually be a decent rapper. ""You say this little white girl is ruining hip-hop/ I say damn right and take a lick of the ring pop/ And smile,"" she drawls, but the track feels like a missed opportunity to do something more than just show up and grin. When she most effectively mines her self-deprecation, the tone of haha i'm sorry recalls not so much her cloud rap contemporaries as it does early-era Anticon, specifically Why?'s 2003 debut Oaklandazulasylum, a twitchy, patched-together record that found a young Yoni Wolf confronting similar issues with his own cred (""I always wanted to be the voice of the streets/ But my father was a rabbi and my mother made beats/ I mean, books/ And the kids from the streets always gave me dirty looks."") But for every moment that suggests she could be the next Yoni, there's another (""I am very YouTube-able"") that suggests she might be the next Tay Zonday; for every impulse that suggests haha i'm sorry could be a calling card, there's a gut feeling that it'll age like a glass of milk left out on the counter. But it's not as if Kitty, who'd totally roll her eyes at the word count of this review, cares either way. Is Kitty Pryde The Hottest New Rapper of 2012, some think piece has probably already asked and prematurely answered. But it speaks volumes about her knowing, self-deprecating appeal that if she heard that question she'd probably be the first to say exactly what you're thinking: yeah riiiiiight.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16894-haha-im-sorry-ep/,Self-released,2012.0,"If you're a fan of rap music, you've probably heard of Kitty Pryde, the Florida-based rapper who made waves in the industry with her unique blend of humor and authenticity. Her latest EP, ""haha i'm sorry,"" showcases her trademark style but with a new level of maturity and self-awareness.

Let's start with a little bit of background on Kitty Pryde. Originally known for her viral hit ""Okay Cupid,"" Kitty Pryde quickly gained a dedicated following thanks to her quirky lyrics and candid approach to social media. She's always been known for her DIY approach to music, and ""haha i'm sorry"" is no exception.

In fact, this EP was produced entirely by Kitty herself, with the exception of a guest verse from Riff Raff on the track ""Orion's Belt."" The result is an album that truly sounds like Kitty's vision brought to life, with every beat and lyric serving a purpose.

As for the music itself, ""haha i'm sorry"" shows a clear evolution in Kitty's style. While she still peppers in her trademark humor (as evidenced by the title track, which features some delightfully sarcastic lyrics), there's a deeper emotional resonance to many of the songs. ""Askin' ""em,"" for example, explores Kitty's struggles with anxiety and the ways in which social media exacerbates those issues. ""It's Not Fair"" tackles the aftermath of a relationship, with Kitty lamenting how unfair it is that she still thinks about her ex.

But even when the subject matter is heavy, Kitty infuses the songs with a certain playfulness that keeps them from feeling too self-serious. Her flow is still as effortless as ever, with a laid-back cadence that perfectly complements the production.

That being said, ""haha i'm sorry"" isn't a perfect album. At times, it can feel a bit repetitive - many of the songs share the same mid-tempo, slightly melancholy vibe. And while it's great to see Kitty's growth as an artist, there are moments where the lyrics feel a bit underdeveloped or overly simplistic. 

Overall, though, ""haha i'm sorry"" is a solid album that showcases Kitty Pryde's unique voice and perspective. If you're a fan of her previous work, you'll definitely find something to love here. And if you're new to her music, this EP is a great place to start - it's a snapshot of an artist who's still figuring things out, but always willing to put herself out there.

Father's Children,Who's Gonna Save the World,,7.4,July 8 2011,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"At the end of the 1960s, three high school friends from Washington, D.C.'s Adams Morgan neighborhood formed a doo-wop group together. They sang in all the usual places-- the park, street corners, walking home from school. After adding a fourth member, they got good enough to start playing parties and talent shows. Even as they got gigs, they still didn't have a name until one was given to them when they backed a local soul singer. They became the Dreams. In the late 60s and early 70s, a lot of predominantly black neighborhoods had community centers working hard to get kids off the streets, and Adams Morgan had the People's Center, founded in 1972 by Norman Hylton. The group found itself frequenting the Center, and it was here that it was suggested that they add instrumentalists and become a self-contained band in the Earth, Wind & Fire vein. The singers recruited a band and took up instruments themselves, quickly developing into a tight, flexible unit with a strong original repertoire, much of it written by keyboardist/vocalist Nick Smith. It was a chance event that put the final piece in place, though: the band emerged unharmed from a rollover van accident while touring Virginia. They changed their name to the more hip and current Father's Children, and most of them converted to a form of Islam. Late in the year, the band entered the studio to make its first album. A few personnel changes, tours to Texas and Bermuda, and some sessions that lasted into 1973 later, they had it. But it never was released. The band couldn't get a record deal as its management company folded, and producer Robert Hosea Williams, who didn't get paid for his work, put the tapes in his garage, where they remained until now. Numero Group has dusted them off and finally put together Who's Gonna Save the World, the lost debut of Father's Children. The album reflects the five-month period over which it was recorded quite well, presenting the band as skilled in funky social commentary, string-soaked love songs, Santana-esque jams, psychedelic post-hippie mysticism, sweet harmony soul and artsy fusion. Some of these songs are truly great. ""Dirt and Grime"", a harmony-soaked rumination on the run-down state of the group's neighborhood, erupts with nasty fuzz-toned guitar that seems encrusted with all the filth implied in the title. On ""Kohoutek"", named for a bright comet that appeared in the night sky in early 1973, the flexibility of the band's spiritual, religious, and mystical beliefs is readily apparent as the horn arrangement and whispers of the title give way to spoken lyrics about the body being a prison for the soul. ""In Shallah"", a gorgeously swaying harmony number, is titled as though it has openly Muslim themes (that's Arabic for ""God Willing""), but it really doesn't-- it's more of a sweet soul tune with spiritual overtones. There are bits that haven't dated well-- the muddled spoken conclusion of ""Everybody's Got a Problem"" is one, with members speaking such profundities as ""war's a drag, man""-- but overall it's a cool album that probably could have done well had it been promptly released. It captures the zeitgeist of its age as well as anything by Earth, Wind & Fire, with not much less commercial appeal. Father's Children endured through the end of the 70s, ultimately releasing a self-titled LP recorded in Hollywood for Mercury Records in 1979, and another after briefly reuniting in 2005. Neither of those went anywhere, and while this release can't quite correct history, it does finally bring to light a good would-be debut by a worthy band that just never caught its break.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15619-whos-gonna-save-the-world/,Numero Group,2011.0,"Who's Gonna Save the World by Father's Children is a soulful and thought-provoking album that evokes a sense of social consciousness and personal reflections. With a genre-defying sound and a rating of 7.4 out of 10, this album showcases the talents of a band that has been making music for over four decades.

Father's Children was formed in the early 1970s, in Washington, DC's music scene. The band consists of four members, each bringing their unique style to the group's sound. With influences from different musical genres, including funk, R&B, and jazz, their music has been described as ""neo-soul"" and ""afro-futuristic."" Their sound evokes the eclectic and socially conscious musical history of their native DC.

Who's Gonna Save the World was produced and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the album's themes of social responsibility, personal accountability, and resilience during times of crisis. The album's opening track, ""The Fall,"" sets the tone for the album's introspective and reflective nature, with the lyrics imploring the listener to take a closer look at their inner selves and to be mindful of the world's problems.

One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Everybody's Got a Right to Live,"" a stirring rendition of a song first recorded by the protest singer Phil Ochs in the 1960s. The song's lyrics are a tribute to the civil rights movement and resonate strongly with today's continuing fight for social justice. The band's soulful interpretation brings a renewed urgency to the song's message.

The album's closing track, ""We Can Heal,"" offers a more hopeful perspective on the world's current problems. With ethereal jazz-like instrumentation and lyrics encouraging unity and compassion, the song leaves the listener feeling both reflective and uplifted.

Personally, I found this album to be a deeply introspective and thought-provoking experience, prompting me to re-examine my values and the role I play in the world. The band's musicianship and vocal harmonies are impeccable, creating a cohesive sound that reflects the band's four-decade-long history of performing and creating music together. While the album's themes are weighty and serious, the music itself is enjoyable and pleasurable to listen to.

In conclusion, Who's Gonna Save the World by Father's Children is a testament to the enduring power of soulful music to prompt personal and social change.

The Big Pink,Future This,Rock,5.2,January 16 2012,Ian Cohen,Contributor,"Sonically, the  Big Pink's 2009 debut delivered. A Brief History of Love's titanic choruses, huge production, and maxed-out volume were designed to explode on the radio. Though they didn't sound like Britpop, the term was applied anyway because the Big Pink seemed in the swaggering lineage of bands like Oasis, the Verve, and Mansun. But bands who emerge so fully formed sometimes lack staying power and, considering Big Pink co-founder Milo Cordell's roots running Merok Records during the cultural peak of blog-house and nu-rave, the band had to be aware of their potential limitations. The follow-up, Future This, finds the Big Pink as boxed in as their predecessors, recycling the same ideas with less conviction. The drop-off is clear in the album's first few seconds: ""Stay Gold"" bears blatant similarity to their previous hit ""Dominos"" but shifts the lyrical focus from consequence-free sex to homilies about staying true to your dreams. It's a troubling thread that runs throughout Future This: where the Big Pink once mastered the role of magnetic, womanizing loners, here their tilt towards positivity and pursuit of a connection with their audience comes off as uncomfortably needy. This results in ill-defined salvos like ""Jump Music"" that awkwardly try to position themselves as message songs despite having no discernable message. The Big Pink try to build a mythology by dropping references from their debut into new songs, as if the two lyrically divergent records were of a conceptual piece. They also toss in a reference to the Stone Roses' ""I Wanna Be Adored"", establishing kinship with another band that was ultimately sunk by not knowing how to follow up a huge debut. And later, ""Hit the Ground (Superman)"" is every bit as gimmicky as ""Stay Gold"", incorporating a sample of Laurie Anderson's ""O Superman"" into its halting, Max Martin-like strut and illustrating the fatal flaw of Future This: their need to siphon the power of outside sources-- obvious samples, prefab slogans, even their borrowings from their own music. Where the Big Pink previously sounded invincible, nearly every attempt to intellectualize or streamline their sound makes Future This come off as timid and malnourished. All of which makes the tender ""77"" a surprising closer. Touching on addiction and loss, lead singer Robbie Furze sings, ""You left such an impression on me/ Left on the debris/ Now I'm all fucked up/ And sometimes I forget I miss you."" It isn't exactly poetry, but it does feel unmistakably personal for a band whose most vulnerable song to this point told a lover to leave them alone. It's an awkward start to humanizing the Big Pink, but a start nonetheless.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16122-future-this/,4AD,2012.0,"When it comes to rock music, few bands are able to achieve the level of creativity and originality that The Big Pink brings to the table. Their latest album, ""Future This,"" showcases their innovative approach to music-making while staying true to the genre's roots. With a rating of 5.2 out of 10, the album may not be considered a masterpiece, but it is definitely worth a listen.

Before delving into the album itself, it's important to note The Big Pink's history. The band was formed in 2007 by English musicians Robbie Furze and Milo Cordell. Their debut album, ""A Brief History of Love,"" was released in 2009 and drew critical acclaim for its unique blend of shoegaze and electronic music. The Big Pink has since released several more albums, each one demonstrating their commitment to pushing boundaries and exploring new sonic territories.

""Future This"" was released in 2012 and is considered a departure from their previous works. The album was produced by Paul Epworth, who worked with the likes of Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Coldplay. The result is a more polished sound that incorporates elements of dance music, hip-hop, and even dubstep.

Despite the new sound, the album still retains The Big Pink's signature emotional depth. Tracks like ""Stay Gold"" and ""Lose Your Mind"" display Furze's soaring vocals and poetic lyrics, while the pulsating beats of ""Hit the Ground (Superman)"" and ""Give It Up"" showcase their experimentation with new sounds.

Personally speaking, ""Future This"" has become a staple on my playlist since its release. As someone who loves both rock and electronic music, it's refreshing to hear a band that seamlessly blends the two genres. The album's high energy gets me pumped up for workouts, while the slower tracks provide a much-needed escape from the chaos of daily life.

That being said, I can understand why some may not be as enthused by the album. The Big Pink's departure from their signature sound may come off as a sellout move to some, while others may feel that the experimentation feels forced. However, I believe that artists should be allowed to grow and evolve, and ""Future This"" is proof of The Big Pink's willingness to take risks and push boundaries.

In conclusion, ""Future This"" may not be a perfect album, but it's definitely worthy of a listen for anyone who appreciates creativity and innovation in music. The Big Pink's ability to combine rock and electronic music is a testament to their artistry, and I cannot wait to see what they come up with next.","1.

Th' Legendary Shack-Shakers,Believe,Rock,7.2,February 16 2005,Joe Tangari,Contributor,"With a title like Believe, you'd think Th' Legendary Shack-Shakers have a specific something to believe in. And yet, the album's cover displays a mishmash of Christian or Muslim hands clasped in prayer, an upside-down star with funky characters on it, palmistry lines on the creepy hand, astrological symbols, crosses, some sort of masonic/Egyptian eye, devil horns, and the sun and moon. What's all that supposed to mean? It's like Douglas Adams' electric monk or something, programmed to believe up to 17 contradictory ideas at once. Electric monkism follows the band into its music-- cowpunk/psychobilly that deals in quasi-religious/sacreligious vagaries but only hints at a connection to the group's ironic Southern Baptist image. Clearly, they're not theologists, and they seem to think Satan's kinda neat in a noncommital way, so don't come for the preaching-- come for a shit-kicking good time. Th' Legendary Shack-Shakers could be considered style over substance but their music is so much fuxD1and, besides, they do style very well. They open the album with its high point-- a badass klezmer/rockabilly hoedown called ""Agony Wagon"", which kicks off with clarinet and accordion riffing, sweet shuffling drums, and fired-up vocal. They seem to realize how good it is, reprising it in the album's closing instrumental. In between, there's plenty of swaggering and stomping about, with big-reverb cowpunk like ""Bible Cyst"" and ""Where's the Devil...When You Need Him?"" rubbing up against the ramshackle acoustic waltz ballad ""The Pony to Bet On"" and distorted hard rock(abilly) numbers like ""Cussin' in Tongues"" and the Sonny Boy Williamson/Willie Dixon cover ""Help Me"". The mouth harp gets plenty of action, especially on ""Fistwhistle Boogie"", where vocalist Col. J.D. Wilkes lets loose on the thing like an Old Western mob on a prisoner. Believe is the second album from the Shack-Shakers (they had the gall to name the first one Cock-a-Doodle-Don't), and by the sound of things they've grown quite comfortable with their spiritually ambiguous ways and more importantly with their brand of wild, raving psychobilly. I actually wish they'd extended the klezmer tip through the whole album, because it's their most interesting card to play, but the chicken shack rock they came up with instead is full of enough piss and vinegar for a plenty good time.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4979-believe/,Yep Roc,2005.0,"If you're looking for a gritty rock and roll album that'll make you feel like you're in a smoky dive bar, you can't go wrong with Th' Legendary Shack Shakers' ""Believe"". This album, with a rating of 7.2 out of 10, is a raucous, foot-stomping ode to rockabilly and punk, infused with a healthy dose of Southern gothic flair.

For those not in the know, Th' Legendary Shack Shakers have been around since the mid-90s, honing their sound and building up a dedicated fan base through relentless touring and a string of critically acclaimed albums. Led by frontman J.D. Wilkes, the band's lineup has shuffled over the years, but their commitment to a high-energy, no-holds-barred sound has remained constant.

""Believe"" is the band's latest offering, and it's clear that they haven't lost their edge with age. The album is a mix of originals and covers, including a rollicking version of Bob Dylan's ""Down in the Flood"". Standout tracks like ""Mud"", ""Misamerica"", and ""Redwing"" showcase the band's signature blend of bluesy wails, frenetic guitar riffs, and pounding drums.

One of the things that sets ""Believe"" apart from the pack is the way that the band incorporates their Southern heritage into their sound. References to Civil War battles and Confederate ghosts abound, but it never feels like they're trying too hard to be kitschy or ironic. Rather, they tap into Southern Gothic tropes in a way that feels genuine and respectful.

But more than anything, what makes ""Believe"" a standout album is the sheer joy that the band brings to their craft. These are musicians who clearly love what they do, and that enthusiasm is infectious. Listening to ""Believe"" feels like being in the room with a band that's having the time of their lives, and that's a feeling that's all too rare in today's music landscape.

All in all, ""Believe"" is a solid addition to Th' Legendary Shack Shakers' discography, and a testament to the enduring power of raw, authentic rock and roll. If you're a fan of the genre, or simply someone who appreciates musicians who give it their all, this album deserves a spot in your collection.","1.

The Sight Below,Glider,"Electronic,Rock",6.8,March 5 2009,Brian Howe,Contributor,"The style of ambient techno that Wolfgang Voigt (Gas, Burger/Ink) minted has proved to be massively influential. It gave us the Field, who leans heavily on the techno side of the Gas aesthetic, arranging pithy scraps of musical information into deathless pulsations. It also gives us Seattle's the Sight Below, a mirror image of the Field. Burying the thump and emphasizing the ambiance, Glider could have been marketed as a lost Gas album while raising only the most initiated eyebrows. It's a cunning facsimile, but a facsimile nonetheless. Luckily, Glider gets by just fine on the sensual pleasure of Voigt's style. And there is a key distinction: While Voigt worked mostly with samples, the Sight Below creates his tracks with autonomously generated sounds. Running a guitar through a variety of looping, reverb, and delay stations, he uses the E-bow, the slide, and tentative picking techniques to circumvent the physical essence of the strings and to marshal clouds of edgeless tone. Only the 4/4 drum tracks-- consisting of cymbal snips, crisp snares, and hypnotic bass bumps-- keep these translucent songs from floating away. The Sight Below's emphasis on melodic and rhythmic regularity makes his music serene and contemplative; it also creates a limitation. This is largely static work, with very little by way of build or release. Ideas presented near the beginning of each track tend to vary only cosmetically, then peter out. Some songs are extremely abstract: On ""At First Touch"", a continuous sub-tone breathes out long, celestial resonances for a few minutes, then gently rocks to a stop. The gusty, towering ""Without Motion"" describes itself accurately. The tracks where palpable textures are admitted tend, naturally, to be more engaging. On ""Dour"", fragments of discernible guitar glint through the streaming haze; on ""Life's Fading Light"", they seem to pull backwards against the pneumatic beat and atmospheric hum. Glider 's derivativeness and inertia put a cap on its capacity to astonish, but it has a protracted shelf life. It's consummate mood music, which goes a long way toward compensating for its shortcomings. And the more I listen, the more esoteric divergences from Gas I start to perceive-- a different personality shining through, aloof and expansively pensive. Voigt alleged that he wanted to ""bring the forest to the disco""-- the Sight Below lines up behind the velvet rope arm-in-arm with the sky.",0,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12741-glider/,Ghostly,2008.0,"Let me tell you about the captivating soundscapes of The Sight Below's album ""Glider."" This album is a unique blend of electronic and rock genres that somehow manage to evoke feelings of both introspection and movement. As someone who has always enjoyed the intersection of these two genres, I was eager to dive into this record and see what it had in store.

The origin story of ""Glider"" is a rather interesting one. The Sight Below, also known as Rafael Anton Irisarri (who hails from Seattle), has a background in both classical and electronic music. He was working in New York when he discovered shoegaze, and that was when he had a vision of electronic music inspired by this dreamy genre. The result is the ethereal and layered sound that we find in ""Glider.""

I find it fascinating that the tracks on the album were all created during the winter months in Seattle. This makes complete sense as the album feels like a sonic representation of a cold winter day. However, this isn't to say that the sound is dull or boring. Rather, it's a thrilling journey into textures and sounds that keep you endlessly intrigued.

As for the individual tracks themselves, ""No Place for Us"" is a standout for me. The inclusion of vocals from Tiny Vipers is an unexpected surprise that complements the moody and contemplative tone of the record. ""Dour"" is another track that envelopes the listener in an atmosphere of dark synth and heavy percussion, and it leaves me feeling both nostalgic and slightly uneasy. 

It's clear that a great deal of attention was given to the arrangement of the tracks. ""Nowhere"" allows us to take a breather from the intensity of the previous tracks, and seems to be a perfect transition to the final track ""At First Touch."" This gives the immersive and introspective journey that is ""Glider"" a satisfying closure.

Overall, I think this album deserves a rating of 8 out of 10. The Sight Below delivers an entrancing listening experience that balances introspection with movement. With its dreamy and experimental approach to merging rock and electronic sounds, ""Glider"" is perfect for anyone who loves to get lost in a world of emotion and texture.","1.
